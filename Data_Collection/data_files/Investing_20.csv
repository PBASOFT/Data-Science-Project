I'm looking for resources that explain how to get started with options. I'm not new to markets (currently have money in TD, Bank of Nova Scotia, Enbridge, Shaw Communications, and Great West Life that's just paying out and reinvestmenting dividends).

I have a small pool of $2000 in an account I forgot about and I'd like to experiment with options with it. Not looking to make tons of money but maybe a couple hundred here and there.  I just don't know where to begin with options so wondering is someone would be able to point me in the right direction of some resources that really dumb it down.

Thanks!",,

There have been people who successfully researched horse racing and consistently made insanely high returns. And they were not gambling. If you are playing to move the expected return to positive, you are not gambling anymore. It's only gambling if you are expected to lose money over time.

Just because there is a probability that an investment will lose money doesn't mean you are gambling.

If you follow your logic, bonds are also gambling. A company may reveal tomorrow that its earnings are completely fraudulent and it has no cash to pay back on its bonds.

Leveraged ETFs aren't ""gambling"" or ""evil."" Leverage simply isn't suitable for highly volatile investments. Leverage shouldn't be kept constant through investment, when returns are cyclical and follow momentum. If there is such a thing as a bull market and bear market, you would want to leverage up in a bull market and leverage down in a bear market. Leveraged ETFs on the other hand charge high fees and maintain a constant leverage ratio, which may not be suitable through the entire time you are invested.",,

Also the reason P/E ratios are so high is because earnings were severely depressed last year due to the COVID-19 shutdown. You need to consider that GDP and profits are growing at an abnormally high rate. Also interest rates are at historic lows which puts upward pressure on stock prices.

This doesn't mean stocks are undervalued, but that there is additional context for you to consider apart from one metric, P/E ratio.

**GDP: +6.5% Q/Q annual rate**

**Corporate profits: +25.2% year over year**

**10-year yield: 1.6%**

Beating acorn takes almost nl effort but gives you big returns over time, their high fees eat your returns. Use revolut or any other ""round it up"" card. Invest said money either in Vanguard or a robo investor of choice. Set up automatic payment. It takes perhaps 15min to do and from day 1 you'll have saved $1/month + lower fees.

Have read The Wealthy Barber but no understanding of reading charts and making well thought out predictions from that. 

-Part time employed at minimum wage Willing to invest 250-500 monthly from income rest into savings for future expense and building a emergency fund 
-Plan to set up a nice financial future mainly mortgage deposit, student loans, and if possible a investment later into real state such as a rental property. 
- Timeline is next 5-10 years not too sure but would like to be able to hold a majority as a retirement plan and hopefully use profits to fund the objectives. 
- My risk tolerance is making educated investments and playing it quite safe so i would say around 90% 
- Current holding as are two Vanguard ETFs  of VFV and VRGO I don't have much understanding other than the little back and forth i have had with my father about Rule of 72 and compound interest 
- No debts at the moment but student loans in a couple years
- Open to all kinds recommendations including platforms and why you like them, great resources such as books.

They have no technical indicators on mobile, and only offer RSI MACD and I believe EMA on the desktop portfolio.  They have very little helpful trading guides, no forex and, compared to TDA, are laughably devoid of features.  

The biggest problem though is they have very clear operational problems and haven't scaled up well to meet their current size.  Putting gamestop aside, they also had severe issues handling crypto volatility and have regular maintenance outages.  If you ever have a problem, their customer service is laughably bad and you will never get help.  

I use robinhood sometimes for the very clean and easy to read options chain.  However, I would never put my money into it again and am very happy using TDA.

ThinkorSwim is overbuilt to hell and, while eyeball sandpaper to look at, is very well equipped for anything you'd need or want.  TDA is gigantic and will probably not run into the same liquidity issues that robinhood does when it comes to unprecedented market volatility, they also have hundreds of legitimately helpful guides and videos on trading strategies among many other things.  Schwab, Vanguard, and Fidelity are also good choices",,

In college we're pretty only taught how to analyze and find stocks through a method ratio comparable and DCF analysis...well there was something based off EPS and P/E Ratio and Adjusted Present Value analysis but other than that not much.

I've worked out a GARP screen that has done reasonably well for me. 

When compared to what we learned in class and to what i've read about Warren Buffett(never really cared much for him regardless of his importance in investing) the approach Lynch takes seems to be more intuitive and approachable.

Since then about 4 years ago i've taken a mix between Boggle and Lynch, as in creating a basic base of 5 broad ETFs and taking my time to find 10 stocks that i can see holding a future of longevity.

If you think of stocks as businesses it becomes a lot more straight forward. You would invest in a business if you see the cost of ownership worth your share of all their expected future earnings based on some analysis.

 If the business performs as expected but the stock price goes up a lot the stock may become overvalued. If the capital tied up in the overvalued stock could be better allocated into a different business at a better price, you may want to consider selling.

If a business fails to perform how you expected and you realize they will not live up to your earnings expectations, then it may be a good reason to sell. Then you should re-examine where in your analysis you made a mistake and try to avoid that in the future.

In my opinion, you should never buy or sell simply based on stock price movements ALONE but take into account how the company is actually performing.",,

88,,2021-05-21 13:36:56,t3_nhspuq,,investing,"Investment Thesis for Daily Journal (DJCO)

Introduction:  The Daily Journal is viewed by the general public as a dying newspaper business.  It is a dying newspaper business, but the Daily Journal has pivoted itself to a SaaS business, but is trading at a valuation far below most other publicly traded Saas businesses.  We will investigate why the Daily Journal is a worthwhile investment at its current valuation.

Management:  Normally, we’d begin by looking at the business, but management within the Daily Journal is incredibly strong, so this will be our beginning.  The Chairman of the Board in Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.  He bought the Daily Journal in 1977 for $2 million dollars and has been the Chairman ever since.  The lesser known name leading the Daily Journal is Gerald Salzman.  He joined the Daily Journal in 1986 as their President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer.  As such, there is likely no one else who knows the Daily Journal as well as Gerald Salzman.  As an added bonus to the quality of the two men leading the Daily Journal, their executive compensation is almost unheard of.  The Board of Directors receive a payment of either $5000 or $0.  Gerald Salzman, the CEO, receives a salary of $250,000.  These are acceptable salaries due to the large amount of insider ownership within the Daily Journal.

The Business:  The Daily Journal has three business segments, 1) The Daily Journal Newspaper, 2) Equity Investments, and 3) Journal Technologies.

---

The Daily Journal Newspaper is a series of mostly California based legal newspapers.  Their revenue comes from advertising from display advertising (i.e. traditional advertising found in most newspapers), classified advertising, trustee notice sale advertising, legal notice advertising, and circulation advertising.  The sad but unfortunate truth for investors is that this portion of their business is worth very little.  The good news, however, is that most investors outside of the Daily Journal are not interested in investing in a dying newspaper and thus has led to the undervaluation of the Daily Journal.

I won’t spend any more time on this segment except to say that the newspaper’s most successful year isemi-modern history was during 2008 due to an extreme uptick in the need for legal advertising relating to the foreclosure of many homes.  It is possible that if another recession strikes, the newspaper business of the Daily Journal could provide some financial cushion to keep the Daily Journal in strong health.

---

Equities have been a growing proportion of the Daily Journal’s intrinsic value.  Charlie Munger’s investing prowess that has benefited Berkshire is also at work within the Daily Journal.  We have insight into the Daily Journal’s American investments thanks to their most recent 13F filing, which was released within the last week.  At this time, the Daily Journal holds $197 million worth of American equities, mostly concentrated in financial services similarly to the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.  Another notable holding is a new and growing position in Alibaba.  

While it is not explicitly confirmed, there is a VERY strong evidence that the Daily Journal also holds a sizable position in BYD, a Hong Kong traded electric car manufacturer.  This would not appear in its 13F filings, so its size cannot be confirmed, however we can make an educated guess.  The exact value of his BYD investment is unknown, however it is assumed to be be roughly $140 million.  In the most recent filing, the Daily Journal notes that it sold $20 million of one of its positions to reinvest into another security.  The suspicion is that this was a shift from BYD to BABA.  As such, we will value the BYD position at $120, though in truth, it may be slightly higher as BYD traded at a fewer dollars higher of a valuation prior to the most recent filing.  Nonetheless, we will assume its value is $120 million.  This brings the Daily Journal’s equity portfolio to a value of $317 million.

The Daily Journal also has $27 million in cash according to their latest annual report and they hold some office buildings in Los Angeles and in Utah which THEY value at $16.5 million.  I emphasized that they value the building because, as I’ll discuss below, the company has some questionable accounting practices.  In the instance of the office buildings in Los Angeles as an example, they valued the buildings at $16.5 million roughly 20 years ago and that figure has never been adjusted.  The result is that they are likely undervaluing the true value of their real estate holdings.  If we increase the value of these holding to $30 million, which seems like a fair appraisal for their buildings based on current market rate, this results in a total equity and asset value of $374 million.

Their liabilities consist of ~$60 million in deferred capital gains (0% interest), a $29.5 million margin loan (3% interest), and a $1.5 million mortgage (4% interest).  The deferred capital gains will not be paid anytime soon as Charlie Munger likes to hold stocks and when he sells, typically he will move into another qualified investment.  The margin loan was used to acquire businesses to build the Saas business and is serviced by the dividends from the bank stocks in the equity portfolio.  The mortgage is self explanatory.  Total liabilities amount to $91 million

Before jumping into the last portion of the Daily Journal’s business segment, I want to note that the Daily Journal has a market cap of $414 million.  As such, to reach its market cap valuation, assuming no value is assigned to the legal newspaper business (it has a value, it’s just not a high value and in all honesty, I don’t know what a fair value is for that business), the Journal Technologies business only needs to be worth $131 million to come a fair market value at its current market cap valuation.

---

Journal Technologies is the hidden gem of the Daily Journal.  It is a legal Saas business being sold to municipalities via the RFP process.  It is a case management system built off of a central e-Suites product that is then configured to meet the client’s needs.

It has a unique business model that results in, once again, an undervaluation of the company.  After being awarded an RFP, the company will then define the scope of the product, establish servers on site, and install its product, and then configure it to the clients needs.  All of this work takes 4 to 8 years to complete and during this time, the municipality is not billed.  On a relevant note to the questionable accounting practices above, the Daily Journal does not report the forthcoming revenue on its financial statements, thus these contracts have not necessarily been taken into account to determine the Daily Journal’s current market valuation.

When its e-Suites product goes live, the Daily Journal will charge an implementation fee and subsequently bill a licensing fee for the next 10 years (with built in price adjustments to account for inflation).  Currently, Daily Journal has over $100 million in forthcoming revenue which, due to their billing practices, is a very high-margin revenue once billing starts.  These contracts are found in the USA, Australia, Canada, and Tasmania currently, though more may have been signed and not discovered.  Credit to Matthew Peterson for taking the time to search across the web looking for tenders awarded to the Daily Journal, as there is not a central repository to identify these contracts.

Moving forward, the assumption is that the Daily Journal will continue onboarding new jurisdictions, there will be an increase in licenses purchased for existing contracts after e-Suites launches, consulting fees for upgrades and modifications will increase, and other e-solutions will be integrated with e-Suites to increase revenue (such as e-payment for fines and tickets).

While the Journal Technologies already has $30-some million in revenue, this figure will increase with time.  Additionally, these municipalities will likely continue using the e-Suite services once they go live after the time and cost of configuration, meaning revenue that is on the books today is revenue that will be on the books likely after the 10 years of licensing has expired.  Presently, Journal Technologies is a $200-$300 million business based on the figures and assumptions above.  Under this assumption, the Daily Journal is valued somewhere between $483 million and $583 million, meaning it is currently undervalued by 17% to 41%.

---

There are a few risks that need to be mentioned.  One is liquidity.  The Daily Journal has a $400 million dollar market cap and is too small for many large financial institutions to monitor.  It also has a $300 share price which, while irrelevant to value, will scare away many newer retail investors who invest $20 to $50 at a time.  Beyond these two issues, the Daily Journal has quite a bit of insider ownership or is owned by firms with long-term visions, thus they are not willing to sell shares on a daily basis.  The result is that only about 5,000 shares are traded on a daily basis.  This means that if you need to liquidate your position in a pinch, you may have to sell below the market rate.

The other glaring issue is age.  Charlie Munger is 97 years old and Gerald Salzman is 80 years old.  Beyond not being at the forefront of technological innovation on a personal level (some may view this as an issue when running a Saas business, personally I am not concerned as there job is to manage the people driving the Saas business), their old age means that in the coming years, their leadership may cease to exist.  No clear succession plan has been identified (this was raised during their last annual meeting by a concerned shareholder).  As management is a key strength within this business, this could be reason for pause for prospective shareholders.

Lastly, there is the $16 billion elephant in the room.  Tyler Technologies is their key competitor.  There are other smaller competitors who offer more limited solutions, but Tyler Technologies is the real competition in this space.  While their products are more modern and (likely) have better and flashier features, this is not necessarily what wins in RFP processes.  Instead, the Daily Journal’s practice of not charging the client until launch is a much more appealing catch for prospective clients.  While I’m sure Tyler Technologies will be a fine company in the long-term, its hard to argue that their fundamentals are nearly as attractive as the fundamentals of the Daily Journal.  The Daily Journal is valued at 8x sales, has a P/B of under 2, and has a P/E of 3.5.  By comparison, Tyler Technologies has a P/B of 8, is valued at 14x sales, and has a P/E of 91.  Tyler Technologies would need to continue growing at a very rapid pace to be a strong value investment (note that Tyler Technologies is still rapidly growing, though this rapid growth is slowing).  By comparison, the Daily Journal, if it continues at its current growth, is already a great investment.  As most clients are onboarded, growth is increasing and it is my belief that this will be a phenomenal investment.

89,,2021-05-21 15:20:42,t3_nhv1rp,,investing,"PPE is becoming much more of a B2B industry, with businesses in need of face masks and other gear to keep operations running smoothly while restrictions are lifted for the general public. This is especially true in states like NY where restrictions are tighter than Miami. 

As the CDC loosens fask mask restrictions for vaccinated people, I’m seeing a ton of young people outside (maskless) in strict areas like NYC. The streets look like a Miami Spring Break - a whole gathering of young people in the streets in large numbers and no masks to be found. 

The big takeaway, however, is that masks are strictly enforced inside all establishments. Using restaurants as an example, customers must wear masks when they enter/exit and move around, but they are not required to wear masks when they eat. Most importantly, business employees MUST wear masks at all times, and will therefore go through masks at a much quicker pace. The business itself will have to provide PPE for their employees, leading me to conclude the future of COVID era PPE is B2B (in the US / EU and countries with access to vaccinations). 

What company is best situated to provide business with direct PPE supply? OPTEC International (OPTI) acquired WeShield - a B2B PPE supplier, with clients from Old Navy to Carl’s Jr. What led me to OPTEC and WeShield however, is an [article ](https://www.bkreader.com/2021/04/14/nyc-restaurants-gifted-free-ppe-through-new-partnership/)I found about their PPE donations to NYC restaurants through a partnership with the NYC Hospitality Alliance. It turns out the WeShield is run by fellow restaurant owners turned medical suppliers. In the article, a WeShield spokesperson said that the PPE cost of a restaurant is about $5-10 per employee, per day. 

The article also acknowledged that alleviating PPE costs for independent restaurants is what sparked their donation campaign. But without donations, $5-10 per employee per day really adds up and leaves us with a still emerging market of PPE buyers. Not just restaurants but all brick and mortar businesses are new customers in a space that was mostly used by healthcare organizations.

It will be interesting to see how the divide for public vs commercial PPE restrictions grows and which sectors maintain their status as large quantity PPE purchasers. For now, restaurants and retail locations have no plans on changing their PPE policies which leaves a niche market for suppliers like OPTEC.",nhv1rp,"Is supplying PPE directly to business the way forward for PPE providers in the US, EU?"

I am looking forward to opening a position on Amazon but I still have a tiny small doubt in my mind, I am wondering if posting my doubt here can help me clear it or better understand it.

The doubt I have is that wouldn't reopening cause a decrease of deliveries on [amazon.com](https://amazon.com)? [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) seems to be hot last year because people don't want to go to stores to buy stuff but once the store opens, wouldn't the traffic of [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) go down? Also, since people are at home more, AWS was getting a lot more traffic from their popular clients such as Netflix. But once the economy reopens, people won't stay at home as much and therefore not go on to AWS-hosted websites as much, right? Other services such as Twitch and Amazon Prime should have lower traffic too because of people spending less time at homes. The only few services I think of might benefit are Whole Foods and IMDb.com.

But somehow, analysts seem very bullish on Amazon's short-term. I am seeing a bunch of $4000-$5000 price targets. Why are analysts giving such high price targets when so much of Amazon's revenue depends on the environment of staying at home?

\- Strong balance sheet with liquidity strength and minimal debt: $6.5 million of cash on hand, with only $2.2 million of existing debt coming due next year   
\- Successful implementation of cost-cutting initiatives: Profits up more than 6x year-over-year at $102,000 for the three-months ended December 27, 2020 despite declining revenues. Profits for the most recent quarter ended March 28, 2021 also reported profits of $416,000 compared to losses of $4.5 million from one year ago.    
\- A new senior management team with a proven track record of operating and transforming franchises. Their ability to navigate through consistently declining sales due to COVID impacts, and emerge with stable profits and cash flows proves their potential to lead the brand to success.

Defenders of payment for order flow generally make three interrelated claims:

* It delivers better prices than exchanges, particularly for retail investors.
* It doesn't benefit market makers beyond the profit they make on a trade.
* It doesn't lead to market concentration and lessened competition.

Mittal's analysis, which examined aggregate trading data of all trades recorded on the public NYSE Trade and Quote system during December, undermines all three claims.

224,gzpbnws,2021-05-28 00:37:27,t1_gzpbnws,t3_nmdtyc,investing,"I am a former professional card counter and blackjack player.

Everything is exponential, and therefore has exponential risk. In BlackJack, the likelyhood you will be up a measly 1% is like 93% of the time but each second you stay in, means you are likely to go the other way and lose. The likelyhood you will double your money is like 2% of the time, and the risk is so high because it almost never happens and when you DO double your money, you keep playing anyways til you lose. 

So the longer you are positive, the more likely you are to lose at blackjack with each passing second based on the odds. 

So how does this apply to stocks? 

Well, establish if you can lose the money, and how risky the play is. Right now, I 'got lucky' and doubled my money in AMC by accident. I should sell now, because let's face it, doubling any money in 36 hours is a 1/1000 chance of happening. On the other hand, I am in a positive bull run. I have $2500 sunk into it, for a $5000 total investment as of today. I did my homework and I believe ( I may be wrong) but I believe it will close in the green tomorrow EOD and also on Tuesday EOD and probably get wiped out Wednesday of next week. So, on one hand, I am absolutely stupid for not selling at a 100% win. On the other, I am risking $2500 which I _could_ afford to lose in a very risky bet to let it ride til Tuesday. 

Now, if you are day trading or week trading, there is something called a win goal. You set up your position with a win amount. If you are new, go for small wins, like 3-5% and see if you can do it. See if you can plop down $1k and see if you make 5% back. If you can consistently do this, great. Maybe increase your win goal then to 10% and see if over time you seem to 'get lucky' and average out to a 10% win goal. It's still gambling with this day and week trading but it's 'informed, educated' gambling. 

The third option is to just buy something and leave it there for 5 years long term. DAL, CCL, or those other transportation ones are like that, as well as AAPL. You just leave them forever. 

My two cents. I am not a financial advisor. This not financial advice. Take everything here with a grain of salt.",,

Secondly, VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market) is at a negligible .03%. What both of you and some of your hypothetical studies don't realize is how sizable that difference is (especially as ETF costs have approached 0 over time) due to compounding. If you don't count fees (and to a lesser extent, tracking error) you are missing a huge part of the equation. 

Over 50 years, any alpha you have gets severely eroded. $1 invested at .03% fees depreciates by 1.5% (1 - .9997\^50). At 1% fees, you would lose **40% (1 - .99\^50)**.

Hi everyone!  I’ve been bouncing an idea around in my head and would love some feedback! I hope some of you would be so kind to help me.

I am currently invested in stock XYZ.  I do not currently have anymore funds to continue investing at this time.  I will have more at the end of the year and would love to double my position.

Now I could wait until years end but this stock most likely would be much higher, I am very bullish on it.  Or I was thinking about just buying ITM call options with expiration 6mos out and exercising them later in the year.  Pretty straight forward right?  Am I missing anything?

341,gzpkrpy,2021-05-28 01:57:18,t1_gzpkrpy,t3_nm50u3,investing,"If you just brought leveraged ETFs like TQQQ. Then that is another story. In order to know whether we should hold it forever, let’s do some calculations. We will use the TQQQ as an example to demonstrate the point.

According to ProShares (the founder of TQQQ), ProShares UltraPro QQQ seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to three times (3x) the daily performance of the Nasdaq Index.

In other words, if Nasdaq rises 1%, TQQQ would also rise 3% because that is three times the performance of the Nasdaq and vice-versa.

Here is the fun part. For the sake of simplicity, let’s assume Nasdaq is at 10,000 points, and you got 100 shares of TQQQ at $100, which would be $10,000 ($100 x 100 shares). Nasdaq rises 10% today and drop 9% tomorrow. So, the Nasdaq index would become 10,010 points (10,000 x 110% x 91%). It would result in 10 points rise. On the other hand, TQQQ will follow the Nasdaq but three time the performance. It would be rising 30% today and drop 27% tomorrow. Therefore, TQQQ price would be $9490 (10,000 x 130% x 0.73%). You are losing money even Nasdaq has 10 points increased. That is called decay. To put it simply, the bigger the single-day volatility, the bigger drop or rise you would experience.

However, we must realize that even though it is mathematically correct, it doesn’t mean it is applicable to all circumstances, which means it might not work like that in real life.

Decay Is Real And Fake At The Same Time

If people are into academics very much, they tend to forget that life is not as perfect as the mathematical formula. Stock markets usually have few ways to perform.
1.	Drop > Rise
2.	Rise > Drop
3.	Rise > Rise More
4.	Drop > Drop More

However, people tend to and love to just talk about situations 1 and 2, which is “drop then rise” and “rise then drop”. They forget about the existence of the other two. In fact, 3 and 4 would very likely happen because the probability is 25% for the four options.

Situation 3 – Rise > Rise More

If the Nasdaq rise 10% today and tomorrow, then it would be 12,100 points (10,000 x 110% x 110%). For the TQQQ, it would be $16900 ($10,000 x 130% x 130%). That is winning by almost 40% more rise than Nasdaq itself.

Situation 4 – Drop > Drop More

If the Nasdaq drop 10% today and tomorrow, then it would be 8,100 points (10,000 x 90% x 90%). For the TQQQ, it would be $5,329 ($10,000 x 73% x 73%). That is losing more than half of Nasdaq itself.

It looks really scary because if you remember the chart from the beginning, if you lose 50%, then you need to gain back 100% to break even. However, we can now notice one very obvious thing, if leveraged products keep rising or dropping, it would have a tremendous result in the price. In other words, it would be more than what the leveraged product promised. But again, that’s just simply based on mathematical calculations, it is not necessarily true in the real world because the place we both live in is far from perfect.

It is nearly impossible for Nasdaq to rise 10% each day for a month or drop 10% each day for a month because Nasdaq or any other index is just too big to fail. You can’t even find one single week in the whole stock market history to drop 10% each day without rebounding or rise 10% each day without adjustment. Therefore, as long as you are not borrowing money to play this game and you decided to hold it until the end, you would be fine.",,

That would be throwing away money.

In-the-money call options are comprised of extrinsic and intrinsic value. (Out-of-the-money options are purely extrinsic value.) The intrinsic value of an option is equal to the stock's price minus the option's strike price; e.g., for $12.15 XYZ price, a $12C would have $0.15 of intrinsic value in its premium. The extrinsic value is everything else in the contract's premium. Using the past example, if the call's premium was $1.00, then $0.85 would be extrinsic value to account for the time to expiration and implied volatility of the contract.

So, exercising a call option that still has extrinsic value results in a loss of that extrinsic value. Again using the same example, if you were to exercise that $12C, then you would lose $85. If you instead sold the contract and purchased 100 shares at $12.15, then you would capture that $85 in extrinsic value.

Don't exercise options unless you absolutely know it will be more profitable.",,

There is a huge demand for the tech especially for the rise of big batteries in EVs.

Stock is 13$ today
Options cost is 2.45-2.90
If I buy 3 at 2.70 = 810$

In December the stock is worth 20$ a share (my hope) 20x300 = 6,000$ but since I will exercise the 12.5c I have I would pay 12.5x300 = 3,750 + the 810$ I paid in premium = 4,560. So essentially I would benefit 1,440$ in difference since I had bought the call options rather than wait and buy at 20$.  

This is how I’m making sense of it in my head.  I understand the 20$ is completely my own hope and wish but I have done my DD on the company and it’s already hit 28$ this last year but like everything else took a hit when market corrected.",,

1) It's really not simplistic to have a ""vested interest"" against leveraged ETFs mate as it is for individual equities mate; I don't hold any bull or bearish positions - stop being lazy with these veiled accusations and support your statements with facts

2) Nobody was ignored. The comment was read and addressed.  I agree with everything stated in the link, or rather, everything in the link supported what I said to begin with  

3) Saying that it is a ""weak point"" to weigh the fees aka cost of leveraging a financial instrument against the benefit of using a financial instrument is one of the most moronic things I've ever heard 

4) Your link neither includes a back-test of leveraged ETFs, nor leveraged ETFs mentioned at all. In fact, I would also agree given today's interest rate environment that using margin is indeed a good strategy 

5) Despite what you say about it being simplistic to find back-tested strategies, every test that shows significant benefits of leveraged ETFs fails to include fees and tracking error. The better case studies (including the one linked prior) all reach the conclusion that the benefits of these ETFs all hinge on fees (which haven't come down) and back-test period. 

6) If leverage is the goal, there are several ways to achieve it, and any leveraged ETF strategy should be comped against those methodologies as well (such as allocating % of your portfolio to LEAPs, margin less interest expense, et.c)",,

I am looking forward to opening a position on Amazon but I still have a tiny small doubt in my mind, I am wondering if posting my doubt here can help me clear it or better understand it.

The doubt I have is that wouldn't reopening cause a decrease of deliveries on [amazon.com](https://amazon.com)? [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) seems to be hot last year because people don't want to go to stores to buy stuff but once the store opens, wouldn't the traffic of [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) go down? Also, since people are at home more, AWS was getting a lot more traffic from their popular clients such as Netflix. But once the economy reopens, people won't stay at home as much and therefore not go on to AWS-hosted websites as much, right? Other services such as Twitch and Amazon Prime should have lower traffic too because of people spending less time at homes. The only few services I think of might benefit are Whole Foods and IMDb.com.

But somehow, analysts seem very bullish on Amazon's short-term. I am seeing a bunch of $4000-$5000 price targets. Why are analysts giving such high price targets when so much of Amazon's revenue depends on the environment of staying at home?

Thanks for sharing your thoughts!",nhixq1,How will reopening affect Amazon?

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-19/oatly-is-said-to-price-ipo-at-top-of-range-with-markets-slumping

Oatly Group AB, the vegan food and drink maker, jumped in its debut after pricing its initial public offering at the top of a marketed range.

Shares opened Thursday at $22.12 in New York, a 30% jump from their $17 IPO price. The company and its investors sold more than 84 million American depositary shares on Wednesday, raising more than $1.4 billion. The Swedish company had offered the shares for $15 to $17 each.

Oatly’s shares, which rose as much as 34%, were up 29% to $21.95 at 1:39 p.m., giving the company a market value of about $13 billion, based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

In July, it secured $200 million in new capital from investors led by Blackstone Group Inc. The group also included celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z, as well as Starbucks Corp. founder Howard Schultz. The company was valued at about $2 billion in that round.


Both Jay-Z, through his company Roc Nation, and Schultz also participated in the IPO, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. A representative for Oatly declined to comment. Roc Nation and Schultz didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The IPO underscores plant-based products’ jump into the mainstream, as environmental and health concerns spur consumers to seek alternatives to traditional meat and dairy products. Investors have been looking for ways to replicate the public-market success of Beyond Meat Inc., whose shares have surged more than 300% since it went public in May 2019.

Oatly’s biggest obstacle might be its own popularity. Since its entrance into the U.S. market in 2017, finding Oatly in coffee shops and supermarkets has become something of a treasure hunt for shoppers.

The company opened a $15 million Millville, New Jersey, plant in 2019 to help meet the growing demand, but even now, shortages are frequent, as Covid-related delays have kept a planned second U.S. production from coming online.

In March, supermarkets across the U.S. -- and even its big new customer Starbucks -- reported trouble procuring orders.

While the current shortage won’t end overnight, Chief Executive Officer Toni Petersson sounded an optimistic note.

Fulfilling Orders
“This year, we will bring on board new capacity every single quarter,” he said in an interview ahead of the first trade. The company is expanding its Netherlands plant, putting out commercial products from its Utah plant, and is doing test runs in Singapore, where the factory will be “up and running” in the second quarter, he said.

For now, Oatly is only filling 70% of orders in its key markets, so it is “not really” taking on new customers, Petersson said, adding that the gap is between supply and orders, not supply and demand. “First we will close the gaps, then expand with new retail partners,” he added.

Oatly was started in 1994 by brothers Rickard and Bjorn Oste. Using technology based on research from Sweden’s Lund University, the company turns fiber-rich oats into liquid food.

Oatly’s offering was led by Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Credit Suisse Group AG. The shares are trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol OTLY.",nhap36,Oatly Jumps in Debut After Raising $1.4 Billion in IPO

I see stocks hitting all-time highs recently and attribute it to monetary and fiscal interventions. And I still mostly buy it. *But*,

Short term rates clearly go down in response to negative shocks, and so do stocks. What to make of it? A few thoughts:

* Which end of the curve? Probably short-term rates swing faster in downturns, and stocks are typically benchmarked against longer-term rates.

* Can negative shocks be expected to keep happening? (Never mind the question of ""Can rates keep going down?"" -- IMO the question of the age.)

* Troll theory: negative shocks are good for stocks in the long term, at least in nominal terms, and market dips are an inefficiency caused by constraints or irrationalities unrelated to underlying value.",,

Plenty of good enduring growth funds adjust their positioning depending on valuation. See T Rowe New Horizons. They've been beating S&P soundly for over 20+ years and their drawdown during recessions are no worse than the S&P.

How do they do it? By leaning in or out of the high risk stuff depending on valuations and momentum. They are mostly positioned in tech/health growth but if you look at their holdings now they've moved a lot of their assets to other sectors...stuff like Waste Connections (garbage collection) which is still growth but with a more reasonable valuation. I expect them as usual to rotate back to deep growth when valuations are back in favor.

What they have in their favor is they've closed their fund to new inflows, so they are easily able to sell their expensive stuff during boom markets.

1) The article plain states that leveraged strategies have lower risk-adjusted returns and negative alpha. 

""There is no free lunch here, though, as the annualized volatility is multiples of the unlevered index, leading to inferior risk-adjusted performance and larger drawdowns""

Further, slide 16/17 DOES NOT refer to a simulation of a leveraged ETF. The calculations here are a proxy of using margin to create leverage - **leverage using margin does not create the same tracking error nor drag that ETFs do**. The issue with margin is that fees here are typically larger than 1%, though historically low margin rates have made it close for a select few brokers. 

2) This article does a more effective back-test (although it still omits tracking error) arrives at the following conclusion - ""Unfortunately there may be a reason not to hold leveraged ETFs for the long term but it has nothing to do with volatility drag. It is because of fees....the return of the leverage = 2 ETF has been reduced to that of a fee-free leverage = 1 ETF. So all the benefits of leveraging have been lost."" 

Equivalent/lower returns at increased risked and higher draw downs equates INFERIOR performance. And yes, there are both 0 fee ETFs (SFY) or negligible fee ETFs like VTI.

3) Don't forget that some of these back-tests don't track dividend error or total return challenges that some leveraged ETFs face.",,

In terms of your response on the articles linked, you point out some really random/minor critiques. If tracking error and lack of historical back-tests which include margin rates from 50-100 years ago is the reason you don't use LETF's there's not much anyone could ever say to convince you otherwise and this whole back and forth is a moot point.

This isn't a broad market index. 

It's a sector specific index. 


>So here are some questions I now have:

>1. Is this dramatic skewedness toward just one or two companies unusual in an ETF?

Depends on the sector.

- How much of the American oil/gasoline secure is Exxon/mobile? 

Probably a lot, there's that many refinery gasoline companies.

- How much of the telecommunication sector is AT&T?

At one time they were practically a monopoly.

- How much of the shipping sector is FedEx?
- How much of the entertainment is Disney?

>2. Does anyone care to explain why such a skewness is justified in this case?

Sector funds for sectors dominated by a few companies are going to be not diverse. And the technology sector is dominated by five companies, who barely compete against each other.


>3. What are some technology ETFs that better balances the exposure to each company in the fund, but also have near-zero expense ratios?

If you want diversification, get a broad market index fund instead of a narrow sector specific fund.

Btw, the five big tech companies are so big, they even  make up 20% of the S&P 500 holding all five top spots.

>there are 331 companies in this ETF, 36% of the entire fund consists of just two companies: Apple and Microsoft.

Apple and Microsoft make up 11% of the S&P 500. They are literally just that freaking big.

I hear alot about ""rebalancing"" for sector or market exposure.  I don't ever do that.  I ""rebalance"" to increase my exposure to companies with improving prospects, and decrease my exposure to companies with declining prospects.  NKE is still a good company, but it owns pretty much every sports brand that ever existed.  What's it going to do for it's next act?  So that's why I'm thinking about reducing NKE.

Thats simply not the case. The best way I can describe it in one line is that Snowflake is a DBA-as-a-Service for data warehousing

Not actually DBAs, but their ODBC connectors and drivers can pair to virtually anything. From 1,000,000,000 row DBASE tables last updated in 1996, SQL, etc. Then links and allows data to be shared, replicated in near real-time, queried, and joined across all of them transparently. Theres not a need for creating the perfect indexes and connectors to get at the data quickly, and you don't have the issues where you wish you could just join two tables in two completely different database systems.


Overall I think they might still be a bit overvalued. But in my opinion they have a much better product than anything else currently out there. I don't really see any direct competition from the big three coming anytime soon, and companies like oracle and IBM are literally still going in the opposite direction, so they don't need to compete on cost but they are in order to get faster adoption.

**First**

I made a RobinHood account to buy some of the stocks that WSB had been supporting (GME, AMC, BB, NOK, BBBY). I put my orders in and, as many others experienced, they cancelled the orders with their bs excuses to protect the short hedge funds.

I have filed a complaint with the SEC, but I'm curious - to what degree is there any sort of fiduciary responsibility to those that put legitimate orders in and as result, potentially lost money?

**Second**

When I made the account they gave me a single share of stock, their ""gift."" After the debacle, the very next day I went to close the account but I couldn't b/c I still had an open position. I opened a Fidelity account, and decided to have them request the share be transferred over. I'm very new to this, so I had no idea there was a $75 transfer fee. If I had, I would have just sold the stock outright. Why would anyone transfer a single share valued at ~$4 for $75?

Now I feel that RH *should* have emailed/messaged me via the app something to the effect of: ""We received your transfer request. There is a $75 fee, or you have X amount of time to cancel the transfer, after which, you are responsible for it."" Or words to that effect. Certainly, they have the time to spam me everyday - and still do!! But nope. They just wanted to steal some more, so not a peep.

Is there any legal or other recourse I can take to have the fee waived, reverse/cancel the transfer etc.?

If you're using it as a retirement account - why not go anywhere else that has better customer support and help lines and doesn't charge fees no matter how small?

I am currently using [https://www.portfolio-performance.info/en/](https://www.portfolio-performance.info/en/) which is great, but it is missing a few features.

I need something that can do the following:

* Track multiple accounts denominated in different currencies
* Input buy/sell transactions that allows deduction of fees in different fiat currencies
* Input buy/sell transactions that deducts fees in another coin (crypto)
* Input dividend transactions that adds dividends in coins (crypto)
* Input swaps (trading one coin for another coin) + deduction of fees in another coin (crypto)
* Analytics for overall portfolio performance (returns, fees, ROI over time, etc.)
* Benchmark portfolio performance against securities, indexes, or other portfolios

Nice to haves:

* Multi platform support (desktop, mobile, etc.)
* Defi support (for yield farming)

Currently, this is all still being tracked using the same application. However, every crypto transaction has to be split into multiple transactions to be tracked.

You buy into a fund that replicates a certain Index. Which means, you buy the actual stocks of the companies as represented in the index your fund uses. My favorite equity fund, VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) uses the FTSE Global All Cap Index, which includes over 9000 companies, representing around 98% of the worlds market cap. Since Apple represents 2.8% of the value of all stocks, Vanguard buys 2.8% of Apple for this fund. This is also called a market cap weighted or market neutral fund, which is the standard and lowest cost approach.

LETF (Leveraged Exchange Traded Fund):

They too replicate an index, but ""amplify"" that indexes returns (in the negative too), by a certain amount like 2x, 3x etc. The traditional way to get leverage would be to borrow money to buy more stocks than you have cash, also called Margin. So to have 2x leverage, you need to borrow as much as you have cash. Margin has the problem that you can be margin-called, this happens when the value of your portfolio drops too low to cover the loan. So you'd have to sell stocks at the worst time to cover the difference, this can often times lead to completely wiping out the value of your portfolio, even to the point where you lost more money than you invested.

LETF's have the advantage that you can't be margin-called. Instead of buying actual stocks and borrowing money to buy double, they buy future contracts and swaps at banks, that promise to pay the returns with a factor of 2 or 3 for example. This obviously leads to relatively high cost. Especially during highly volatile markets. Due to their nature, they can only replicate precise 2x or 3x exposure if you buy and sell them daily. There is a lot of discussion that this ""time decay"" effect might not be so relevant in certain scenarios and could be viable long term. They also introduce ""counter-party risk"", since you have to trust that the banks who sold those contracts to your fund don't go bankrupt.",,

Stock futures are higher this morning, with the Dow leading the way, up 0.5% S&P and Nasdaq are up 0.4%. That’s as of 0630. This follows a day of gains for the Dow and S&P, while the Nasdaq was flat. The Russell 2000 rallied 1% yesterday.

Those gains don’t tell the whole story however, as this week has seen a marked reversal in risk appetite. The Nasdaq is up 2% for the week, with the S&P up about 1%. Companies like Boeing, Ford, Roblox, AMC, and GameStop have seen dramatic rallies.

We have a couple of economic reports today that could shed more light on consumer spending and inflation. The Personal Income and consumer spending reports and PCE Core Price Index, the Fed’s preferred gauge for inflation, are out at 0830. Expectations on the PCE are for a 2.9% year-over-year print for April.

We also have Chicago PMIs out at 0945. Last month saw a record (I think) 72.1 reading. Expectations for this month are for 68. Obviously both of these readings are well above the 50 level separating expansion from contraction.

I got into AMC yesterday on the break above the highs from a couple months ago. I’m doing the same with a few other meme and high short-interest stocks which could see rapid gains in a short amount of time on the hype. I already made quick gains on JMIA, SPCE, and BYND. My strategy is always to have a stop loss I’m OK with, take partial profits on any jump up, and constantly raise stops as price appreciates. I also keep my position size small compared to my total portfolio. 

As a part of the general market I think the moves back to meme stocks is because people are frustrated where stocks are still bottoming and consolidating. The crypto correction has sent traders looking for wild gains elsewhere. This is causing rushes into smaller names wherever momentum starts to pick up and it means the moves could be short-lived. 

Markets get more and more wild as a top happens. Then it seems like just another dip when a decline has really begun. At this stage of the bull market while I’m being aggressive when the moment is right I will prioritize safety and honor my stops if things don’t go as I hope.

742,,2021-05-28 11:32:30,t3_nmvuhl,,investing,"(I know this is not CMV but figured the format worked and really more interested in this sub’s take on it)

I understand that taxation on investments is advantageous to incentivize investing. However, a big part of that requires people to adjust their investment strategy over time. But in effect, a lot of investments are more rigid because people avoid realizing gains when they would like to pivot their positions. Meanwhile, realizing losses is one of the oldest tricks in the books to diminish one’s tax liability. 

So here’s my view: kind of like a 401k account, there should be a system that allows people to sell without tax implications as long as those proceeds are used to reinvest in another stock, and as long as those stocks have been held for over a year (does not apply to day trading, so that it stays in the spirit of investing). Taxation would kick in only when a sale is used to convert into actual income. In exchange, the tax rate on this income would be taxed higher (say as a regular income, for the sake of argument). One question is what base to use? In this case, I’d say we could simply use the overall performance of the portfolio to estimate those gains. Ultimately this is the performance everyone is looking at.

Basically, think of it as a 401k type account without penalty for early withdrawal, where only money coming out of that account is taxed.

I feel like it could solve a few problems:

1/ It would enable people to consider investing in whatever is more worthy to them. People change their minds, companies change their strategies… it would bring more fluidity to the system and promote the idea of genuinely investing in companies worth investing in.
2/ it would counterbalance loss realization tactics.

$PTON had $1.82B of revenue in 2020. It currently trades at a market cap of roughly 33B. $FRX / $BODY is on track for $1.1B in revenue this year and is being valued at roughly 3B after the merger is completed.... I think we have some upside here...  
Peloton’s trailing 12 months revenue is currently at 3.692B. Again $FRX soon to be $BODY is on track to hit 1.1B this year. That’s plenty of upside for the short term.   
Long term they are projected to hit 3.3B by 2025.With the integration of all parts of their business (Bikes, Supplements, Connected Fitness Subscriptions Services, OpenFit App, BODi, etc.) the value for each new customer acquired goes up. Plus, they will have a marketing war chest after the merger to achieve their growth target.

Biden plans to increase the top tax rate on capital gains to 43.4% from 23.8% for households with income over $1 million, though Congress must OK any hikes and retroactive effective dates, the report added.

Separately, a New York Times report said Biden plans to propose a $6 trillion budget on Friday that would take the U.S. to its highest sustained levels of federal spending since World War II.

Documents obtained by the Times show that Biden’s first budget request as president calls for total spending to rise to $8.2 trillion by 2031 as he aims to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure and substantially expand the social safety net, that newspaper’s report added.

This is from my own valuation model, similar to Vanguards but not the same. So it's not ""them"" giving themselves leeway. It's also not me giving myself leeway. It's just the historical accuracy of the model. Yes, +/-4% a year over 10 years is a huge range. There's a really big difference in outcome if we experience the lower range, nominal, or upper range. It's why you have to be really careful reading article's like OP's and taking radical action based on it. You have to consider the accuracy and the entire probabilistic range of the forecast if you intend to use it to guide allocation decisions. 

But, I also don't think you can dismiss the fact that US valuations are reaching extreme conditions and historically this means our expectation of return over the next decade should be tempered.",,

I am looking forward to opening a position on Amazon but I still have a tiny small doubt in my mind, I am wondering if posting my doubt here can help me clear it or better understand it.

The doubt I have is that wouldn't reopening cause a decrease of deliveries on [amazon.com](https://amazon.com)? [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) seems to be hot last year because people don't want to go to stores to buy stuff but once the store opens, wouldn't the traffic of [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) go down? Also, since people are at home more, AWS was getting a lot more traffic from their popular clients such as Netflix. But once the economy reopens, people won't stay at home as much and therefore not go on to AWS-hosted websites as much, right? Other services such as Twitch and Amazon Prime should have lower traffic too because of people spending less time at homes. The only few services I think of might benefit are Whole Foods and IMDb.com.

But somehow, analysts seem very bullish on Amazon's short-term. I am seeing a bunch of $4000-$5000 price targets. Why are analysts giving such high price targets when so much of Amazon's revenue depends on the environment of staying at home?

850,,2021-05-21 13:36:56,t3_nhspuq,,investing,"Investment Thesis for Daily Journal (DJCO)

Introduction:  The Daily Journal is viewed by the general public as a dying newspaper business.  It is a dying newspaper business, but the Daily Journal has pivoted itself to a SaaS business, but is trading at a valuation far below most other publicly traded Saas businesses.  We will investigate why the Daily Journal is a worthwhile investment at its current valuation.

Management:  Normally, we’d begin by looking at the business, but management within the Daily Journal is incredibly strong, so this will be our beginning.  The Chairman of the Board in Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.  He bought the Daily Journal in 1977 for $2 million dollars and has been the Chairman ever since.  The lesser known name leading the Daily Journal is Gerald Salzman.  He joined the Daily Journal in 1986 as their President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer.  As such, there is likely no one else who knows the Daily Journal as well as Gerald Salzman.  As an added bonus to the quality of the two men leading the Daily Journal, their executive compensation is almost unheard of.  The Board of Directors receive a payment of either $5000 or $0.  Gerald Salzman, the CEO, receives a salary of $250,000.  These are acceptable salaries due to the large amount of insider ownership within the Daily Journal.

The Business:  The Daily Journal has three business segments, 1) The Daily Journal Newspaper, 2) Equity Investments, and 3) Journal Technologies.

---

The Daily Journal Newspaper is a series of mostly California based legal newspapers.  Their revenue comes from advertising from display advertising (i.e. traditional advertising found in most newspapers), classified advertising, trustee notice sale advertising, legal notice advertising, and circulation advertising.  The sad but unfortunate truth for investors is that this portion of their business is worth very little.  The good news, however, is that most investors outside of the Daily Journal are not interested in investing in a dying newspaper and thus has led to the undervaluation of the Daily Journal.

I won’t spend any more time on this segment except to say that the newspaper’s most successful year isemi-modern history was during 2008 due to an extreme uptick in the need for legal advertising relating to the foreclosure of many homes.  It is possible that if another recession strikes, the newspaper business of the Daily Journal could provide some financial cushion to keep the Daily Journal in strong health.

---

Equities have been a growing proportion of the Daily Journal’s intrinsic value.  Charlie Munger’s investing prowess that has benefited Berkshire is also at work within the Daily Journal.  We have insight into the Daily Journal’s American investments thanks to their most recent 13F filing, which was released within the last week.  At this time, the Daily Journal holds $197 million worth of American equities, mostly concentrated in financial services similarly to the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.  Another notable holding is a new and growing position in Alibaba.  

While it is not explicitly confirmed, there is a VERY strong evidence that the Daily Journal also holds a sizable position in BYD, a Hong Kong traded electric car manufacturer.  This would not appear in its 13F filings, so its size cannot be confirmed, however we can make an educated guess.  The exact value of his BYD investment is unknown, however it is assumed to be be roughly $140 million.  In the most recent filing, the Daily Journal notes that it sold $20 million of one of its positions to reinvest into another security.  The suspicion is that this was a shift from BYD to BABA.  As such, we will value the BYD position at $120, though in truth, it may be slightly higher as BYD traded at a fewer dollars higher of a valuation prior to the most recent filing.  Nonetheless, we will assume its value is $120 million.  This brings the Daily Journal’s equity portfolio to a value of $317 million.

The Daily Journal also has $27 million in cash according to their latest annual report and they hold some office buildings in Los Angeles and in Utah which THEY value at $16.5 million.  I emphasized that they value the building because, as I’ll discuss below, the company has some questionable accounting practices.  In the instance of the office buildings in Los Angeles as an example, they valued the buildings at $16.5 million roughly 20 years ago and that figure has never been adjusted.  The result is that they are likely undervaluing the true value of their real estate holdings.  If we increase the value of these holding to $30 million, which seems like a fair appraisal for their buildings based on current market rate, this results in a total equity and asset value of $374 million.

Their liabilities consist of ~$60 million in deferred capital gains (0% interest), a $29.5 million margin loan (3% interest), and a $1.5 million mortgage (4% interest).  The deferred capital gains will not be paid anytime soon as Charlie Munger likes to hold stocks and when he sells, typically he will move into another qualified investment.  The margin loan was used to acquire businesses to build the Saas business and is serviced by the dividends from the bank stocks in the equity portfolio.  The mortgage is self explanatory.  Total liabilities amount to $91 million

Before jumping into the last portion of the Daily Journal’s business segment, I want to note that the Daily Journal has a market cap of $414 million.  As such, to reach its market cap valuation, assuming no value is assigned to the legal newspaper business (it has a value, it’s just not a high value and in all honesty, I don’t know what a fair value is for that business), the Journal Technologies business only needs to be worth $131 million to come a fair market value at its current market cap valuation.

Journal Technologies is the hidden gem of the Daily Journal.  It is a legal Saas business being sold to municipalities via the RFP process.  It is a case management system built off of a central e-Suites product that is then configured to meet the client’s needs.

It has a unique business model that results in, once again, an undervaluation of the company.  After being awarded an RFP, the company will then define the scope of the product, establish servers on site, and install its product, and then configure it to the clients needs.  All of this work takes 4 to 8 years to complete and during this time, the municipality is not billed.  On a relevant note to the questionable accounting practices above, the Daily Journal does not report the forthcoming revenue on its financial statements, thus these contracts have not necessarily been taken into account to determine the Daily Journal’s current market valuation.

When its e-Suites product goes live, the Daily Journal will charge an implementation fee and subsequently bill a licensing fee for the next 10 years (with built in price adjustments to account for inflation).  Currently, Daily Journal has over $100 million in forthcoming revenue which, due to their billing practices, is a very high-margin revenue once billing starts.  These contracts are found in the USA, Australia, Canada, and Tasmania currently, though more may have been signed and not discovered.  Credit to Matthew Peterson for taking the time to search across the web looking for tenders awarded to the Daily Journal, as there is not a central repository to identify these contracts.

Moving forward, the assumption is that the Daily Journal will continue onboarding new jurisdictions, there will be an increase in licenses purchased for existing contracts after e-Suites launches, consulting fees for upgrades and modifications will increase, and other e-solutions will be integrated with e-Suites to increase revenue (such as e-payment for fines and tickets).

While the Journal Technologies already has $30-some million in revenue, this figure will increase with time.  Additionally, these municipalities will likely continue using the e-Suite services once they go live after the time and cost of configuration, meaning revenue that is on the books today is revenue that will be on the books likely after the 10 years of licensing has expired.  Presently, Journal Technologies is a $200-$300 million business based on the figures and assumptions above.  Under this assumption, the Daily Journal is valued somewhere between $483 million and $583 million, meaning it is currently undervalued by 17% to 41%.

---

There are a few risks that need to be mentioned.  One is liquidity.  The Daily Journal has a $400 million dollar market cap and is too small for many large financial institutions to monitor.  It also has a $300 share price which, while irrelevant to value, will scare away many newer retail investors who invest $20 to $50 at a time.  Beyond these two issues, the Daily Journal has quite a bit of insider ownership or is owned by firms with long-term visions, thus they are not willing to sell shares on a daily basis.  The result is that only about 5,000 shares are traded on a daily basis.  This means that if you need to liquidate your position in a pinch, you may have to sell below the market rate.

The other glaring issue is age.  Charlie Munger is 97 years old and Gerald Salzman is 80 years old.  Beyond not being at the forefront of technological innovation on a personal level (some may view this as an issue when running a Saas business, personally I am not concerned as there job is to manage the people driving the Saas business), their old age means that in the coming years, their leadership may cease to exist.  No clear succession plan has been identified (this was raised during their last annual meeting by a concerned shareholder).  As management is a key strength within this business, this could be reason for pause for prospective shareholders.

Lastly, there is the $16 billion elephant in the room.  Tyler Technologies is their key competitor.  There are other smaller competitors who offer more limited solutions, but Tyler Technologies is the real competition in this space.  While their products are more modern and (likely) have better and flashier features, this is not necessarily what wins in RFP processes.  Instead, the Daily Journal’s practice of not charging the client until launch is a much more appealing catch for prospective clients.  While I’m sure Tyler Technologies will be a fine company in the long-term, its hard to argue that their fundamentals are nearly as attractive as the fundamentals of the Daily Journal.  The Daily Journal is valued at 8x sales, has a P/B of under 2, and has a P/E of 3.5.  By comparison, Tyler Technologies has a P/B of 8, is valued at 14x sales, and has a P/E of 91.  Tyler Technologies would need to continue growing at a very rapid pace to be a strong value investment (note that Tyler Technologies is still rapidly growing, though this rapid growth is slowing).  By comparison, the Daily Journal, if it continues at its current growth, is already a great investment.  As most clients are onboarded, growth is increasing and it is my belief that this will be a phenomenal investment.

There is pretty significant data that shows that the value premium is very pronounced during periods of high inflation, but very neglible or even negative during periods of low inflation or deflation.

If you look at periods where growth have outperformed value:

1. 1930's great depression, a deflationary period. Bad economic conditions put value at significant risk with lots of bankruptcies.

2. 1990's, due to the tech bubble(which later reversed and led to value substantially outperforming in 2000's)

3. 2010's- a period following the great recession. Low interest rates as well as growth stocks being surprisingly cheap. Apple traded at a P/E below 9 in 2013, microsoft below 7 in 2011, Alphabet below 18 in 2011. It's not surprising that growth outperformed.

The factors we see now are the total opposite. Growth is historically expensive relative to value, inflation expectations are rising, the economy looks like it is overheating.",,

We have given the in-person So…you want to research old companies at the Library of Congress before and because there was interest, we are doing it this time as a webinar! On June 9th at 1pm eastern time we are teaching the Historical Company Research Webinar.

While the class is primarily about using the Library’s resources to do historical research on companies, some of the resources we cover aren’t necessarily specific to the Library, so if you can come,  you may be able to take what you learn and see if your local public libraries and historical societies have resources that can help with this type of research. We plan on covering print and electronic sources – both free and subscription – as well as giving a few tips and tricks picked up over the years.

So if you found an old stock or bond certificate in a relative’s papers, or you are interested in the company that made that cool item you found while antiquing, this class might be for you!

961,,2021-05-28 13:53:44,t3_nmybub,,investing,"Novation Companies, Inc. OTCBB $NOVC Kansas City, MO Investment Thesis 

SEC REG SHO is being abused at NOVC.

Maryland MD Corp Novation Companies $NOVC allow Fortress & EJF Capital to own both 31.3M 27% of common and own only Sr Debt. Appearance is they use Debt to buy/take shares at pennies Read 

This allows a new investor to turn $240,000 into $300,000,000 plus reap & annual dividends up to $33,000,000/year.

Why does Fortress/EJFcap/ Igdaloff/Gillman/MassMutual Barings/Thomas Akin w/ 77% of Novation Companies, Inc. $NOVC common create the portrait that NOVC will waste $730M NOLs & Rights that control collateral assets to most of $3 Billion RMBS 6% WAC Portfolio? They have successfully reorganized public companies just like $NOVC including $DX/$NRZ/$DS/$COOP/$CMO/$OMF/$SNR/$IMH. 

I believe their plan has been to drive NOVC share price down via false narrative while at same time giving themselves almost 50M shrs at pennies or less (Fortress, EJF Capital are both the economic owners of NOVC only Sr Debt aka Note Holders to exit Ch 11 & be given 31.3M common with no cram down (reduction in principle). Fortress owns CDO Service Rights hold CDOs Taberna I and II holds 2/3rd Sr Debt and therefore 31.3M and EJF Capital owns CDO Service Rights on Kodiak CDO One 1/3rd of Sr Debt and therefore 31.3M shares, see below. Fortress and EJF Capital paid virtually nothing to own these CDOs same year DX investors joined NOVC Board 2010. This is itself an oxymoron since no investor can pursue the interests of both Debt and Common Equity at same time. NOVC Board is led by Fortress’ past co investor at Dynex Capital NYSE $DX Barry Igdaloff, Chairman. In addition to awarding Note Holders 31.3M shares at less than one cent, he has converted Board compensation at pennies into 18M RSUs restricted stock units aka common). Fortress & EJF Capital are the economic owners of all of NOVC only Sr Debt (Note Holders) to exit Ch 11 April 2019 with $6.3M cash & no cram down reduction in principle. August 2019 NOVC Board led by Barry Igdaloff, Chairman gave Note Holders 31.3M NOVC Common at less then one cent; 9M common at zero + 22.250M ten-year warrants at one cent strike aka zero see [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novation-companies-inc-executes-first-202127796.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novation-companies-inc-executes-first-202127796.html) Igdaloff allows Fortress & EJF to conceal their identities behind CDOs that own both the largest common positions 31.3M 27% and all of NOVC only Sr Debt. No disclosure has ever been made in SEC filings of the Sr Debt true economic owners, let alone their past DX co investing relationship with NOVC Board. This omission of transparency needs to be including in the SEC “Schedule of Beneficial Ownership”.

I believe NOVC has used Sr Debt as fodder to drive share price down while they convert 50M common at pennies. By concealing their true restructure plans they rent GAAP and AICPA reputation of top 200 CPA firm to create a false narrative including “Going Concern”.

I believe these investors will make billions by doing what they have done many times before, especially $DX and $DS aka $NRZ/$SNR/$GCI, $COOP, $IMF & $OMF. Their end game is not only creating billions but creating annually hundreds of millions in cash flow off dividends and lucrative management fees. I believe they really plan to split Novation Companies, Inc. $NOVC into at least two tax exempt/tax free public companies like they did at DS/NRZ/SNR/GCI. 

This allows a new investor to turn $240,000 into $300,000,000 plus reap & annual dividends up to $33M/year. Allow me to explain below:

$NOVC holds; $730M NOLs just like other Fortress companies:

o $COOP Mr. Cooper Fortress Wesley Edens merged COOP $3.8B with Fortress owned Nationstar formerly traded $WMIH/$WAMU $7B NOLs

o $DX Dynex Capital holds $120M NOLs. Fortress reorganized with NOVC Chairman of the Board Barry Igdaloff 2000-03 with his cabal (Igdaloff and his cabal own at least 40M NOVC Common). Fortress owned 100% of Capstead which camouflaged Fortress $DX ownership. Edens flew to Columbus OH 2000 to visit with Mr. Igdaloff (I know because Igdaloff told me so).

o $DS Drive Shack holds $160M NOLs See Wesley Edens $DS Shareholder Presentation Dec 2016 (see attached) which shows Fortress restructured Newcastle Inv Corp ex symbol $NCT by separating out 3 tax exempt MREITs (SNR, GCI, NRZ) before changing the name from Newcastle to Drive Shack $DS. [https://ir.driveshack.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/62/newcastle-decides-to-change-reit-status-beginning-in-2017](https://ir.driveshack.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/62/newcastle-decides-to-change-reit-status-beginning-in-2017) 

It is my belief based on SEC filings that no investor will make a dime off of NOVC Sr Debt but the 31.3M shares could be worth billions & generate hundreds of millions in annual dividends and management fees as follows:

Fortress, Wesley Edens, CEO & EJF Capital, CEO Emanuel J. Manny Friedman are world class MREIT, NOL, CCR cleanup call right investors, they must be motivated to create annual dividends and lucrative management fees out of rights per NOVC signed Service Rights Transfer Agreement Sec 5.04 (see back of NOVC 10Q Q3 2007). This is just what Fortress Wesley Edens, former Head of MBS Desks at both Blackrock and Lehman Bros did at tax exempt MREIT $NRZ www.newresi.com (per 2020 NRZ 10K shows Fortress collected $190M in one year from NRZ shareholders including $170M management fees plus tens of millions in NRZ dividends). 

NOVC can separate Novastar Financial Inc. former top 10 MREIT traded on NYSE symbol NFI. NFI can monetize tax exempt most important the nuclear fuel to duplicate past reorganizations especially at $NRZ/$DS, $DX ...etc. aka Cleanup Call Rights (well known to MREIT experts above). These rights are well defined in NOVC signed Service Rights Transfer Agreement Sec 5.04 (attached to this email and to NOVC 10Q Q3 2007). Novastar Financial Inc. was saved by NOVC Ch 11. The Service Rights Transfer Agreement Sec 5.04 (ex-symbol NYSE NFI) provide Cleanup Call Rights CCR rights that control most $3B Billion RMBS Portfolio of collateral assets that carry 600 Bpts weighted average coupons (these collateral assets are rich and seasoned and can be leveraged/resecuritized at estimated 500 Bpts NIMs into Annual Dividend). $NOVC 2020 10K creates a subtle deception or misleads investors & Mr. Market by stating the current value of these rights page 25 of 10K. It is the future plans to use these rights aka control over rich, seasoned collateral assets that matter to NOVC future reorganization not current value that counts. To illustrate NOVC NFI holds rights to 3B portfolio see [www.novationcompanies.com](http://www.novationcompanies.com/) for Bond Remittance Reports and Edgar Reports for Pooling Service and Trust Agreements. MREIT experts understand CCR are triggered once the Bond Balances hit 10% of original face value. CCR allow NOVC to access the collateral assets (Quants call CCR the “2nd Bite of Apple) which must be taken out at par, unless NOVC or an agent like Fortress buys the actual bonds back at discount. The Bonds are owned by many different investors that are probably unaware of the CCR. Imagine accessing 3Billions of collateral assets for 1.5B or half. The collateral assets can be leveraged (DX and NRZ use 15:1 in normal market) this creates at $45B portfolio which given current market conditions can produced NIMs think Gross Margins (Net Interest Margins of 500 Bpts) 45B x 5% = NIM of $2,300,000,000 less some SGA and Loan Loss Reserves. NOVC will require capital to execute which I believe is pre agreed to or quid pro quo between MassMutual and sub-Barings own 19.3M shares and Note Holders Fortress and EJF Capital own 31.3M shares and Barry Igdaloff cabal own at least 40M shares. This quid pro quo is defined in NOVC approved Proxy 14A filed Oct 2018 pages 11-15 that prices one NOVC Common Rights at $2.33/share (exactly MassMutual and Barings cost basis $48M invested dividend by 19.3M shares per 10K. 

NOVC second entity can be operated tax free as www.healthcare-staffing.com HCS which can use $730M NOLs. HCS produces between $50M and $61M in gross revenue (margins of 36% with high credit customers), has a high regulatory moat in Community Service Bureaus market in state of GA. I debriefed with several leaders that suggest HCS should expand into TX and VA that operate CSB just like GA. One of the leaders provided an unsolicited quoted by David Pointer, HCS and NOVC CEO as stating to 6 HCS Managers “You should buy NOVC ASAP as we have a plan to turn it around, especially while it still trading at pennies”. In addition, this same HCS leader quoted Mr. Pointer as saying we want to grow HCS very slowly. It is my belief Pointer was expressing a directive from Note Holders and Barry Igdaloff to time future HCS growth only after they had collected at least 50M shares at pennies. 

Conclusion if Novation Companies, Inc. $NOVC separates NFI like Wesley R. Edens, COB did at Newcastle Inv Corp $NCT aka now called Drive Shack $DS Note Holders stand to make billions and generate hundreds of millions in annual management fees & dividends. Drive Shack $DS web site holds Mr. Wesley Edens’ presentation Dec 2016 to DS shareholders attached. Slides 4-5 spell out his aka Fortress’ restructuring at Newcastle $NCT/$DS www.newresi.com $NRZ which paid Fortress in 2019 alone $2.00/share annual dividend in addition to Fortress lucrative management fee $170M in one year alone. Could NOVC generate estimated annual dividend $2-6/common share? May be pay Fortress/EJF or combination another new 1.5% Mgt Fee like Fortress collects annually at $NRZ. Remaining or 2nd company HCS www.healthcare-staffing.com can operate tax free with $730M NOLs aka gravy just like Drive Shack $DS was to Newcastle Investment Corp ex symbol $NCT. These investors led by Fortress, EJF, MassMutual and Barry Igdaloff own 90.6M NOVC common (19.3M+31.3M+40M) and I and small count of investors own at least 30M NOVC common totals 120.6M versus NOVC 10K for 2020 shows only 115M common shares outstanding. Over 60M shares have traded over the last year (45M just since 2020 holidays) on no news, Going Concern and Form 4s which I believe are private transfers or parking shares at family and related entities. 

Feel free to contact me regarding any questions how to turn $240K into $300M plus annual dividends.",nmybub,"Investment Thesis on Penny Stock 77% owned by MassMutual, Fortress owned by SoftBank & Band of related investors that control NOVC Board"

Index funds go back to the 70s. VFIAX was created in 1976.

>Do ETFs really beating up active investing

ETFs and active investing aren't exclusive. Actively managed ETFs exist (see ARKK for example).

>Let's say people panic and start massively selling ETFs. Indexs can drops for 50% or even more. What happened when new money stop coming to passive funds?

Not all index funds are ETFs (see FSKAX for example), not all ETFs are index funds.

The funds rebalance as necessary to reflect new market conditions. If index funds drop, so will most actively managed funds and likely many individual stocks.

>Except few years, America has strong bull market for last three decades. It wasn't always like this. In 1930s to 1950s S & P 500 almost lost 3 decades. How ETFs will perform in long bear market?

There are many more index funds than just ones that cover the S&P 500. There's US total market (VTSAX for example). Also there are non-US index funds (SCHF, SCHE, FTIHX for a few examples).

>ETF is passive investment. But you still making an ACTIVE choice when pick up ETFs. Will be world ETF or will be S & P 500. There are like over 100 ETFs.

That's a decision you don't need to make too often.

>1. Buffet with Berkshire beating up S & P 500 and there is no dividend with Berkshire investment. It is tax optimal. Zero cost with provision and on top they performed much better in all crises.
