https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Don't think I need to say anything here. It's pretty obvious that there could be a very sharp rebound from the trendline soon enough

Advice: don't play this short term or you'll get bruned, markets can stay irrational for a long time. Just hold shares, maybe with 2:1 leverage if you are brave. If you need to play options, go LEAPS for this one and it might make you a lot of money.

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

208,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

218,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I‚Äôve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I don't know if this next line is necessary or not but just to be safe....I'm not a professional financial advisor and this is not investment advice.",nk79sh,$CHWY - Earnings coming up - huge upside potential

I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

244,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

As most knows well in [***‚ÄúThere Is No Way, This Doesn‚Äôt End Badly,‚Äù***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/there-is-no-way-this-bull-market-doesnt-end-very-badly/) virtually every measure of fundamental analysis suggests the markets are very expensive. 

Let's dig in 

 *10-year forward returns are below zero historically when the price-to-sales ratio is at 2x. There has never been a previous period with the ratio climbing to near 3x.‚Äù* 

&#x200B;

 Whether it is Market Capitalization to GDP, CAPE, Tobin‚Äôs Q, or Price-to-Sales, the problem with all valuation measures is they are **horrible market-timing indicators.**¬†As shown in the chart below, **if you had gone to cash when the S&P first crossed into** ***‚Äúexpensive‚Äù*** **territory greater than 23x CAPE, you would have missed most of the current bull market cycle.**¬†

Being doggedly attached to valuations and fundamentals can prove just as dangerous to long-term returns as getting caught in a bear market. **While a bear market does indeed destroy capital, not participating in a bull market has an equal impact on ending results.**¬†

An excellent example of the problem, shown below, with purely using fundamentals to manage a portfolio is the performance chart between *‚Äúmomentum‚Äù* and *‚Äúvalue‚Äù* since 2009.

Of course, this is the direct result of sustained ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy) and successive rounds of monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve.

Conclusion :

 **However, as is the case with every bull market, a strongly advancing market covers up the many investing mistakes investors make. It is the ensuing bear market that reveals them in the most brutal and unforgiving of outcomes.**¬† 

 

**You can not successfully** ***‚Äútime the market.‚Äù*** Trying to be *‚Äúall in or out‚Äù* of every twist and turn of the market is impossible. **However, that doesn‚Äôt mean you must be passive and let it all wash all over you.**

There is a clear advantage to providing risk management to portfolios over time.¬†**The problem is that most individuals cannot manage their own money because of** ***‚Äúshort-termism.‚Äù*** *(As shown by shrinking holding periods)*

 **Of course, with the media and Wall Street pushing the**¬†***‚Äúyou are missing it‚Äù***¬†**mantra as the market rises, can you blame the average investor** ***‚Äúpanic‚Äù*** **buying market tops and selling market bottoms?** 

&#x200B;

 I do understand there is a significant risk.¬†[***If Jack Bogle is correct***](http://www.businessinsider.com/jack-bogle-warns-of-two-50-percent-market-declines-in-next-10-years-2013-4)***,***¬†*things* could be very disappointing. Or, as Seth Klarman from Baupost Capital once stated:

>***‚ÄúCan we say when it will end? No. Can we say that it will end? Yes. And when it ends and the trend reverses, here is what we can say for sure. Few will be ready. Few will be prepared.‚Äù***

 

We saw much of the same mainstream analysis at the peak of the markets in 1999 and again in 2007. New valuation metrics, IPO‚Äôs of negligible companies, valuation dismissals as¬†*‚Äúthis time was different,‚Äù*¬†and a building exuberance were common themes.¬†**Unfortunately, the outcomes were always the same.**¬†

Our goal is to prepared.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

818,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

Revenue for the quarter came in at **$747.27 million versus** the **consensus estimate of $620.18** million which is **200% revenue growth from Q4 2020**

Q1 EPS of ($0.48), in-line with the analyst estimate of ($0.48

By end of the year, # of markets will be doubled from last year

For the second quarter of 2021, revenue is expected to be between **$1.025 billion and $1.075 billion,** which represents **41% sequential growth over 1Q21** at the midpoint of the expected range. Adjusted EBITDA1  is expected to be between ($5) million and $5 million, which represents breakeven margin at the midpoint of the expected range

AND, Opendoor has about $**2 billion in cash.** If you follow the industry, you know that M&A is a real winner which will give them to expand even faster to additional markets.

I can't really think of many stocks that are better than Opendoor. Lots of potential here and it's at the price it jumped to on DA. It is more than 50%+ off of its highs and I think it represents a great buying opportunity as of right now.

What are your thoughts on the quarter and what do you think its price target is for the coming year and long term?

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

828,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I‚Äôve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

854,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

873,,2021-05-25 10:07:40,t3_nkm5ho,,wallstreetbets,"> Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO said that it has extended its current manufacturing deal for another three years -- and that its manufacturing partner has agreed to double the factory's production capacity.  
>  
>Although the company has talked from time to time about building a factory, NIO doesn't currently own one. Its vehicles are manufactured in a factory belonging to Chinese state-owned automaker **Jianghuai Automobile Group** in the industrial city of Hefei, where NIO is headquartered.  
>  
>Under the new deal, the JAC factory will continue to build NIOs for another three years, through May of 2024. JAC also agreed to increase the manufacturing capacity of the factory to 240,000 NIO vehicles per year (or 20,000 per month). That will roughly double the production capacity available to NIO.  
>  
>NIO said in April that it had completed upgrades that will allow it to manufacture [up to 10,000 vehicles per month](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/08/why-nio-stock-is-higher-today/), though ongoing shortages of battery cells and semiconductors have so far [limited it to a lower output](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/30/after-a-good-first-quarter-nio-joins-the-ranks-of/).  
>  
>As with many deals involving Chinese automakers, the details of this arrangement are a bit complicated. While JAC owns the factory, it was designed and built specifically for NIO, and it's operated by a third company called Jianglai Advanced Manufacturing. Jianglai is a joint venture between NIO and JAC in which NIO holds a 49% stake.

As most knows well in [***‚ÄúThere Is No Way, This Doesn‚Äôt End Badly,‚Äù***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/there-is-no-way-this-bull-market-doesnt-end-very-badly/) virtually every measure of fundamental analysis suggests the markets are very expensive. 

Let's dig in 

 *10-year forward returns are below zero historically when the price-to-sales ratio is at 2x. There has never been a previous period with the ratio climbing to near 3x.‚Äù* 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mok55matq8171.png?width=923&format=png&auto=webp&s=373aed0c5936f724473ccc367778191d6ca08b70

 Whether it is Market Capitalization to GDP, CAPE, Tobin‚Äôs Q, or Price-to-Sales, the problem with all valuation measures is they are **horrible market-timing indicators.**¬†As shown in the chart below, **if you had gone to cash when the S&P first crossed into** ***‚Äúexpensive‚Äù*** **territory greater than 23x CAPE, you would have missed most of the current bull market cycle.**¬† 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rw9b4ppwq8171.png?width=937&format=png&auto=webp&s=18a0f6b96a4b0b26d9b136099df08d46cdfcb32b

 

Being doggedly attached to valuations and fundamentals can prove just as dangerous to long-term returns as getting caught in a bear market. **While a bear market does indeed destroy capital, not participating in a bull market has an equal impact on ending results.**¬†

An excellent example of the problem, shown below, with purely using fundamentals to manage a portfolio is the performance chart between *‚Äúmomentum‚Äù* and *‚Äúvalue‚Äù* since 2009.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gunafgc0r8171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89d412aec69578bff108852fb42bf9a43594f99

 

Of course, this is the direct result of sustained ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy) and successive rounds of monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve.

Conclusion :

 **However, as is the case with every bull market, a strongly advancing market covers up the many investing mistakes investors make. It is the ensuing bear market that reveals them in the most brutal and unforgiving of outcomes.**¬† 

 

**You can not successfully** ***‚Äútime the market.‚Äù*** Trying to be *‚Äúall in or out‚Äù* of every twist and turn of the market is impossible. **However, that doesn‚Äôt mean you must be passive and let it all wash all over you.**

There is a clear advantage to providing risk management to portfolios over time.¬†**The problem is that most individuals cannot manage their own money because of** ***‚Äúshort-termism.‚Äù*** *(As shown by shrinking holding periods)*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7vtl8r3kr8171.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f8d2248e179a7bd00d11dd3cd885c459bae51fe

 **Of course, with the media and Wall Street pushing the**¬†***‚Äúyou are missing it‚Äù***¬†**mantra as the market rises, can you blame the average investor** ***‚Äúpanic‚Äù*** **buying market tops and selling market bottoms?** 

&#x200B;

 I do understand there is a significant risk.¬†[***If Jack Bogle is correct***](http://www.businessinsider.com/jack-bogle-warns-of-two-50-percent-market-declines-in-next-10-years-2013-4)***,***¬†*things* could be very disappointing. Or, as Seth Klarman from Baupost Capital once stated:

>***‚ÄúCan we say when it will end? No. Can we say that it will end? Yes. And when it ends and the trend reverses, here is what we can say for sure. Few will be ready. Few will be prepared.‚Äù***

 

We saw much of the same mainstream analysis at the peak of the markets in 1999 and again in 2007. New valuation metrics, IPO‚Äôs of negligible companies, valuation dismissals as¬†*‚Äúthis time was different,‚Äù*¬†and a building exuberance were common themes.¬†**Unfortunately, the outcomes were always the same.**¬†

Our goal is to prepared.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

1205,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

By end of the year, # of markets will be doubled from last year

For the second quarter of 2021, revenue is expected to be between **$1.025 billion and $1.075 billion,** which represents **41% sequential growth over 1Q21** at the midpoint of the expected range. Adjusted EBITDA1  is expected to be between ($5) million and $5 million, which represents breakeven margin at the midpoint of the expected range

AND, Opendoor has about $**2 billion in cash.** If you follow the industry, you know that M&A is a real winner which will give them to expand even faster to additional markets.

I can't really think of many stocks that are better than Opendoor. Lots of potential here and it's at the price it jumped to on DA. It is more than 50%+ off of its highs and I think it represents a great buying opportunity as of right now.

I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles!

1215,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

1217,,2021-05-24 19:50:44,t3_nk6md0,,wallstreetbets,"The point is that senior employees of public companies are required to make their transactions public. It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I‚Äôve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

1241,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

1260,,2021-05-25 10:07:40,t3_nkm5ho,,wallstreetbets,"> Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO said that it has extended its current manufacturing deal for another three years -- and that its manufacturing partner has agreed to double the factory's production capacity.  
>  
>Although the company has talked from time to time about building a factory, NIO doesn't currently own one. Its vehicles are manufactured in a factory belonging to Chinese state-owned automaker **Jianghuai Automobile Group** in the industrial city of Hefei, where NIO is headquartered.  
>  
>Under the new deal, the JAC factory will continue to build NIOs for another three years, through May of 2024. JAC also agreed to increase the manufacturing capacity of the factory to 240,000 NIO vehicles per year (or 20,000 per month). That will roughly double the production capacity available to NIO.  
>  
>NIO said in April that it had completed upgrades that will allow it to manufacture [up to 10,000 vehicles per month](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/08/why-nio-stock-is-higher-today/), though ongoing shortages of battery cells and semiconductors have so far [limited it to a lower output](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/30/after-a-good-first-quarter-nio-joins-the-ranks-of/).  
>  
>As with many deals involving Chinese automakers, the details of this arrangement are a bit complicated. While JAC owns the factory, it was designed and built specifically for NIO, and it's operated by a third company called Jianglai Advanced Manufacturing. Jianglai is a joint venture between NIO and JAC in which NIO holds a 49% stake.

As most knows well in [***‚ÄúThere Is No Way, This Doesn‚Äôt End Badly,‚Äù***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/there-is-no-way-this-bull-market-doesnt-end-very-badly/) virtually every measure of fundamental analysis suggests the markets are very expensive. 

Let's dig in 

 *10-year forward returns are below zero historically when the price-to-sales ratio is at 2x. There has never been a previous period with the ratio climbing to near 3x.‚Äù* 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mok55matq8171.png?width=923&format=png&auto=webp&s=373aed0c5936f724473ccc367778191d6ca08b70

 Whether it is Market Capitalization to GDP, CAPE, Tobin‚Äôs Q, or Price-to-Sales, the problem with all valuation measures is they are **horrible market-timing indicators.**¬†As shown in the chart below, **if you had gone to cash when the S&P first crossed into** ***‚Äúexpensive‚Äù*** **territory greater than 23x CAPE, you would have missed most of the current bull market cycle.**¬† 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rw9b4ppwq8171.png?width=937&format=png&auto=webp&s=18a0f6b96a4b0b26d9b136099df08d46cdfcb32b

 

Being doggedly attached to valuations and fundamentals can prove just as dangerous to long-term returns as getting caught in a bear market. **While a bear market does indeed destroy capital, not participating in a bull market has an equal impact on ending results.**¬†

An excellent example of the problem, shown below, with purely using fundamentals to manage a portfolio is the performance chart between *‚Äúmomentum‚Äù* and *‚Äúvalue‚Äù* since 2009.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gunafgc0r8171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89d412aec69578bff108852fb42bf9a43594f99

 

Of course, this is the direct result of sustained ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy) and successive rounds of monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve.

Conclusion :

 **However, as is the case with every bull market, a strongly advancing market covers up the many investing mistakes investors make. It is the ensuing bear market that reveals them in the most brutal and unforgiving of outcomes.**¬† 

 

**You can not successfully** ***‚Äútime the market.‚Äù*** Trying to be *‚Äúall in or out‚Äù* of every twist and turn of the market is impossible. **However, that doesn‚Äôt mean you must be passive and let it all wash all over you.**

There is a clear advantage to providing risk management to portfolios over time.¬†**The problem is that most individuals cannot manage their own money because of** ***‚Äúshort-termism.‚Äù*** *(As shown by shrinking holding periods)*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7vtl8r3kr8171.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f8d2248e179a7bd00d11dd3cd885c459bae51fe

 **Of course, with the media and Wall Street pushing the**¬†***‚Äúyou are missing it‚Äù***¬†**mantra as the market rises, can you blame the average investor** ***‚Äúpanic‚Äù*** **buying market tops and selling market bottoms?** 

&#x200B;

 I do understand there is a significant risk.¬†[***If Jack Bogle is correct***](http://www.businessinsider.com/jack-bogle-warns-of-two-50-percent-market-declines-in-next-10-years-2013-4)***,***¬†*things* could be very disappointing. Or, as Seth Klarman from Baupost Capital once stated:

>***‚ÄúCan we say when it will end? No. Can we say that it will end? Yes. And when it ends and the trend reverses, here is what we can say for sure. Few will be ready. Few will be prepared.‚Äù***

 

We saw much of the same mainstream analysis at the peak of the markets in 1999 and again in 2007. New valuation metrics, IPO‚Äôs of negligible companies, valuation dismissals as¬†*‚Äúthis time was different,‚Äù*¬†and a building exuberance were common themes.¬†**Unfortunately, the outcomes were always the same.**¬†

Our goal is to prepared.

I am relatively new to options trading. Like all want to get in the next gme ride. Looks like spce maybe the next one to go for. However I have read a lot of posts/blogs/crap news sites that spce is the next short squeeze play. I have no idea weather these posts are fake news, made up news by people who don‚Äôt know what they are actually talking about or real news. 

I am looking for helpful pointers on I how to understand the fundamentals behind how to evaluate the probability or market signals of a short squeeze. Or indeed a gamma squeeze. Do I look at %of float shorted for example? Is 20% a good or bad number. I assume I have to look at that number in the context of other factors? 

Looking for some help please.

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Don't think I need to say anything here. It's pretty obvious that there could be a very sharp rebound from the trendline soon enough

Advice: don't play this short term or you'll get bruned, markets can stay irrational for a long time. Just hold shares, maybe with 2:1 leverage if you are brave.

Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

Maybe QE Infinity will be enough but I'm skeptical. Banks don't want to lend to the public at these dumpster interest rates. Interest rates that are this low because of the Fed's QE. Like the article says, they'd rather get dumpster returns from the Fed. At least those are risk-free.

The knock-on effects of the massively artificially inflated asset prices and forcing investors out the risk curve are much more worrisome to me. People are taking on more and more risk and the only chance of it being worth it is if the Fed never leaves the game. The market would price stocks and junk bonds much lower than they are now, but the Fed has their thumb on the scale so investors have to take outsized risks to get the same returns. If the Fed decides to stop, there's going to be a shit-ton of bag holders.

The other problem is shit like we're seeing in real estate. Investors looking for yield are pushing up prices and buy up a shit-ton of homes with it. People are buying homes sight-unseen because they're afraid of getting left behind. This is fueling the explosion in real estate *at the same time there's an unprecedented supply and building shortage*. Even worse, big investment firms are buying entire neighborhoods to turn into rental properties. Average people who would have been able to afford a home aren't able to meet the down payment requirements, much less compete with all-cash offers coming from buyers who are either cash rich because the Fed pumped their investment portfolios to unprecedented highs, or have ultra-cheap non-mortgage financing.",,

We see the price reacting to either the Support ($140.00) or the Resistance ($190.00). From a technical perspective, there is no advantage in trading within the pattern. You will have a great Risk/Reward ratio after the price breaking out of the structure.  


There are (obviously) two possible scenarios. The current sentiment is pointing towards a bullish scenario, which can be confirmed be looking at the MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence) and the RSI (Relative Strength Index). The average price is increasing while the price is going in a sideways movement. In this case, we see buyers being active on the market without being able to spot it in the first sight.  


For a proper breakout of the horizontal channel, we want to see **increasing volume and a strong reaction at the support/resistance**. This is my personal confirmation for loading more stocks. If the price moves past the $140.00 level, i will look for a lower entry around the $100 level.",,

# SPY [Gamma](https://spotgamma.com/)Read:

Gamma Index: Decreased to 0.06 (Large positive reading - play smaller moves in markets, likely that current prices are well supported by options market maker hedging.)		

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)		

Abs Gamma Strike: Increased to 420 (May function as a ‚Äúmagnet‚Äù and large liquidity area.)		

Gamma Notional: Increased to 288 (A large positive gamma position infers lower volatility in the underlying.\_		

Put Wall Support: Unchanged		

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)		

Gamma Tilt: Increased to 1.09 (If the ratio increases it‚Äôs considered a bullish signal,)	

Net Delta: Increased to 189.234 (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)		

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.07 (decreasing put demand)		

Topp Abs Gamma Strikes: 	\[425, 420, 418, 415\]

TA Notes:

* 20 SMMA acting as a support
* Note that I bumped the resistance up a little from last night's post. 
* Bulls need to break 421.04 
* Bears need to hold resistance and test 417 support (have a lot of work to do)
* Bullish pt: 422.43 - 423.81 - 425.15
* Bearish pt: 415-413-410

# 15 min RSI

* \>50 = bullish
* Near oversold but has room to run
* Bulls need 77.53 - 87.99
* Bears need 41.51 - 37 - 22

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

2001,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

2011,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow.

With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

# Does SelfWealth impose any restrictions on stocks such as GameStop (GME)?

* 25 days ago
* Updated

&#x200B;

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

As most knows well in [***‚ÄúThere Is No Way, This Doesn‚Äôt End Badly,‚Äù***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/there-is-no-way-this-bull-market-doesnt-end-very-badly/) virtually every measure of fundamental analysis suggests the markets are very expensive. 

Let's dig in 

 *10-year forward returns are below zero historically when the price-to-sales ratio is at 2x. There has never been a previous period with the ratio climbing to near 3x.‚Äù* 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mok55matq8171.png?width=923&format=png&auto=webp&s=373aed0c5936f724473ccc367778191d6ca08b70

 Whether it is Market Capitalization to GDP, CAPE, Tobin‚Äôs Q, or Price-to-Sales, the problem with all valuation measures is they are **horrible market-timing indicators.**¬†As shown in the chart below, **if you had gone to cash when the S&P first crossed into** ***‚Äúexpensive‚Äù*** **territory greater than 23x CAPE, you would have missed most of the current bull market cycle.**¬† 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rw9b4ppwq8171.png?width=937&format=png&auto=webp&s=18a0f6b96a4b0b26d9b136099df08d46cdfcb32b

 

Being doggedly attached to valuations and fundamentals can prove just as dangerous to long-term returns as getting caught in a bear market. **While a bear market does indeed destroy capital, not participating in a bull market has an equal impact on ending results.**¬†

An excellent example of the problem, shown below, with purely using fundamentals to manage a portfolio is the performance chart between *‚Äúmomentum‚Äù* and *‚Äúvalue‚Äù* since 2009.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gunafgc0r8171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89d412aec69578bff108852fb42bf9a43594f99

 

Of course, this is the direct result of sustained ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy) and successive rounds of monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve.

Conclusion :

 **However, as is the case with every bull market, a strongly advancing market covers up the many investing mistakes investors make. It is the ensuing bear market that reveals them in the most brutal and unforgiving of outcomes.**¬† 

 

**You can not successfully** ***‚Äútime the market.‚Äù*** Trying to be *‚Äúall in or out‚Äù* of every twist and turn of the market is impossible. **However, that doesn‚Äôt mean you must be passive and let it all wash all over you.**

There is a clear advantage to providing risk management to portfolios over time.¬†**The problem is that most individuals cannot manage their own money because of** ***‚Äúshort-termism.‚Äù*** *(As shown by shrinking holding periods)*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7vtl8r3kr8171.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f8d2248e179a7bd00d11dd3cd885c459bae51fe

 **Of course, with the media and Wall Street pushing the**¬†***‚Äúyou are missing it‚Äù***¬†**mantra as the market rises, can you blame the average investor** ***‚Äúpanic‚Äù*** **buying market tops and selling market bottoms?** 

&#x200B;

 I do understand there is a significant risk.¬†[***If Jack Bogle is correct***](http://www.businessinsider.com/jack-bogle-warns-of-two-50-percent-market-declines-in-next-10-years-2013-4)***,***¬†*things* could be very disappointing. Or, as Seth Klarman from Baupost Capital once stated:

>***‚ÄúCan we say when it will end? No. Can we say that it will end? Yes. And when it ends and the trend reverses, here is what we can say for sure. Few will be ready. Few will be prepared.‚Äù***

 

We saw much of the same mainstream analysis at the peak of the markets in 1999 and again in 2007. New valuation metrics, IPO‚Äôs of negligible companies, valuation dismissals as¬†*‚Äúthis time was different,‚Äù*¬†and a building exuberance were common themes.¬†**Unfortunately, the outcomes were always the same.**¬†

Our goal is to prepared.

In 1979, President Jimmy Carter had appointed Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. With inflation running double digits the Federal Reserve under Volker raised the federal funds rate from 11.2% to 20% by June of 1981.The intent was to break the inflationary spiral within the United States. But raising the federal funds rate also made it more difficult to borrow money. This helped cause the 1980-1982 recession and a national unemployment rate of over 10%. As a result, the Bear Market of 1982 could be called Volker's Bear.

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

2814,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

2824,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow.

With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

# Does SelfWealth impose any restrictions on stocks such as GameStop (GME)?

* 25 days ago
* Updated

&#x200B;

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

I got two for $18.50 during the dip on May 19th. Yesterday they sold for $21.65 - $22.

I don't plan to hold until expiry. I bought them as a way to hedge against inflation, which I can barely grasp.

But my idea is that as inflation devalues the dollar, prices go up. ALL prices go up. From big macs to chicken tendies and stonks. 

Even if the market has a pull back, and the valuation of companies goes down aka SPY P/E drops. The actual dollar is worth less, so more dollars are needed to buy SPY. Thus SPY should go up as measured by the future dollar.

Essentially a SPY LEAP is like a mortgage. Even if property value goes down, inflation alone can make a 25 year mortgage worthwhile. Because you lock in based on todays dollar value. Imagine having a mortgage in Zimbabwe, Argentina, Venezuela before hyperinflation. Not that I expect hyper-inflation on the USD.

I'm not allowed to use margin, or sell covered calls/puts on my account.

Not sure what you mean about monthly 0.2 delta. My Greeks show delta (daily) of $0.38 and Theta of $0.023.

Even if SPY breaks $450 by Jan of next year, I should still be up 50%, see this http://opcalc.com/v4x",,

He will never be released for parole. His condition in prison and the terms of his release are independent topics.

Although he might not deserve video games and exercise machines, I believe that discriminating against certain inmates is wrong no matter the crime. If the Norwegian penitentiary board decides that all inmates should have access to the newest PlayStation console, then he should have the same access.

I‚Äôm sure most of the Norwegian population would like to lock him in a hole and forget about him, and I can‚Äôt blame them. The problem with doing that is that it would open up for the possibility for future mistreatment of inmates, which would overall increase both recidivism and crime rates.

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

3186,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

3196,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow.

With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

# Does SelfWealth impose any restrictions on stocks such as GameStop (GME)?

* 25 days ago
* Updated

&#x200B;

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

>  
>Although the company has talked from time to time about building a factory, NIO doesn't currently own one. Its vehicles are manufactured in a factory belonging to Chinese state-owned automaker **Jianghuai Automobile Group** in the industrial city of Hefei, where NIO is headquartered.  
>  
>Under the new deal, the JAC factory will continue to build NIOs for another three years, through May of 2024. JAC also agreed to increase the manufacturing capacity of the factory to 240,000 NIO vehicles per year (or 20,000 per month). That will roughly double the production capacity available to NIO.  
>  
>NIO said in April that it had completed upgrades that will allow it to manufacture [up to 10,000 vehicles per month](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/08/why-nio-stock-is-higher-today/), though ongoing shortages of battery cells and semiconductors have so far [limited it to a lower output](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/30/after-a-good-first-quarter-nio-joins-the-ranks-of/).  
>  
>As with many deals involving Chinese automakers, the details of this arrangement are a bit complicated. While JAC owns the factory, it was designed and built specifically for NIO, and it's operated by a third company called Jianglai Advanced Manufacturing. Jianglai is a joint venture between NIO and JAC in which NIO holds a 49% stake.

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

3880,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

3890,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow.

With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know.",nkedem,Should you bet on PENN?

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

# Does SelfWealth impose any restrictions on stocks such as GameStop (GME)?

* 25 days ago
* Updated

&#x200B;

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

3933,,2021-05-25 10:07:40,t3_nkm5ho,,wallstreetbets,"> Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO said that it has extended its current manufacturing deal for another three years -- and that its manufacturing partner has agreed to double the factory's production capacity.  
>  
>Although the company has talked from time to time about building a factory, NIO doesn't currently own one. Its vehicles are manufactured in a factory belonging to Chinese state-owned automaker **Jianghuai Automobile Group** in the industrial city of Hefei, where NIO is headquartered.  
>  
>Under the new deal, the JAC factory will continue to build NIOs for another three years, through May of 2024. JAC also agreed to increase the manufacturing capacity of the factory to 240,000 NIO vehicles per year (or 20,000 per month). That will roughly double the production capacity available to NIO.  
>  
>NIO said in April that it had completed upgrades that will allow it to manufacture [up to 10,000 vehicles per month](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/08/why-nio-stock-is-higher-today/), though ongoing shortages of battery cells and semiconductors have so far [limited it to a lower output](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/30/after-a-good-first-quarter-nio-joins-the-ranks-of/).  
>  
>As with many deals involving Chinese automakers, the details of this arrangement are a bit complicated. While JAC owns the factory, it was designed and built specifically for NIO, and it's operated by a third company called Jianglai Advanced Manufacturing. Jianglai is a joint venture between NIO and JAC in which NIO holds a 49% stake.

3943,,2021-05-25 13:19:38,t3_nkpl9a,,wallstreetbets,"Why is there not much chatter around GRAMF? Everything I read about this company indicates its a potential multibagger.

My analysis:

GRAMF is a cannabis holding company focusing on recreational cannabis products. Currently it consists of two lines: Caliva, a delivery-based recreational cannabis company, and Monogram, a luxury cannabis brand. 

Currently GRAMF trades at $6.00 and 96mio shares outstanding for a market cap of $575m.

GRAMFs market cap of $575m is tiny compared to most of the well-known cannabis stocks which are all 1bio+. It has huge room for upside growth.

GRAMF currently holds close to $300m just in cash. Compared to its $575m market cap, this implies GRAMF has a floor price of¬† $3.26 JUST based on cash alone!

MARKET SHARE

The cannabis market is currently particularly fragmented without any clear brand winner. For example, in california the top 10 cannabis brands only make up 30% total sales in the region. GRAMF has a good chance to emerge as a leader in this field for two reasons.

1. Star Power: GRAMF is partnered with Jay-Z and his company Roc Nation (With artists like Rihanna, Meek Mill, Alicia Keys, et al). This is a huge outlet for cheap mass marketing, celebrity endorsements, and promotion. This will cement GRAMF as a brand in consumers‚Äô minds.

2. M&A: GRAMF management indicates it plans to use its huge cash war chest to aggressively acquire competitors. These M&A deals will consolidate its foothold in the cannabis field and M&A news will also help spike GRAMF share price.

GROWTH

Recreational cannabis was just legalized in march 2021 in NY. This is a huge untapped market which GRAMF has indicated is a focus of expansion. With Jay-Z and his east coast reputation at the helm, GRAMF has a huge chance to become a brand name in the region. 

Federal legalization in 2021/2022 is a also potential catalyst for the cannabis sector as a whole. Cannabis legislation by all indications looks to be favorable under the current Biden administration and has bipartisan support. GRAMF is currently only traded OTC because current regulations do not allow cannabis stocks to be listed on exchanges. Once regulation reform comes and GRAMF gets listed, this will drive share prices up.

GRAMF has come off from its initial price of ~$11 when it first deSPAC‚Äôed to around $6 currently due to weak Q1 revenues and margins and its relative quietness currently. Its now trading quite cheaply compared to other cannabis stocks out there, and if it can post better Q2 numbers, make a splash in M&A, and builds up its general brand recognition, expect the share price to skyrocket.",nkpl9a,My DD on GRAMF: Waiting for takeoff?

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

4130,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

Revenue for the quarter came in at **$747.27 million versus** the **consensus estimate of $620.18** million which is **200% revenue growth from Q4 2020**

Q1 EPS of ($0.48), in-line with the analyst estimate of ($0.48

By end of the year, # of markets will be doubled from last year

For the second quarter of 2021, revenue is expected to be between **$1.025 billion and $1.075 billion,** which represents **41% sequential growth over 1Q21** at the midpoint of the expected range. Adjusted EBITDA1  is expected to be between ($5) million and $5 million, which represents breakeven margin at the midpoint of the expected range

AND, Opendoor has about $**2 billion in cash.** If you follow the industry, you know that M&A is a real winner which will give them to expand even faster to additional markets.

I can't really think of many stocks that are better than Opendoor. Lots of potential here and it's at the price it jumped to on DA. It is more than 50%+ off of its highs and I think it represents a great buying opportunity as of right now.

What are your thoughts on the quarter and what do you think its price target is for the coming year and long term?

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

4140,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I‚Äôve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

4166,,2021-05-25 02:00:02,t3_nkedem,,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out

Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,where to buy GME stocks in Australia?! SelfWealth is evil and stake was dodgy!

4183,,2021-05-25 10:07:40,t3_nkm5ho,,wallstreetbets,"> Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO said that it has extended its current manufacturing deal for another three years -- and that its manufacturing partner has agreed to double the factory's production capacity.  
>  
>Although the company has talked from time to time about building a factory, NIO doesn't currently own one. Its vehicles are manufactured in a factory belonging to Chinese state-owned automaker **Jianghuai Automobile Group** in the industrial city of Hefei, where NIO is headquartered.  
>  
>Under the new deal, the JAC factory will continue to build NIOs for another three years, through May of 2024. JAC also agreed to increase the manufacturing capacity of the factory to 240,000 NIO vehicles per year (or 20,000 per month). That will roughly double the production capacity available to NIO.  
>  
>NIO said in April that it had completed upgrades that will allow it to manufacture [up to 10,000 vehicles per month](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/08/why-nio-stock-is-higher-today/), though ongoing shortages of battery cells and semiconductors have so far [limited it to a lower output](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/30/after-a-good-first-quarter-nio-joins-the-ranks-of/).  
>  
>As with many deals involving Chinese automakers, the details of this arrangement are a bit complicated. While JAC owns the factory, it was designed and built specifically for NIO, and it's operated by a third company called Jianglai Advanced Manufacturing. Jianglai is a joint venture between NIO and JAC in which NIO holds a 49% stake.

4193,,2021-05-25 13:19:38,t3_nkpl9a,,wallstreetbets,"Why is there not much chatter around GRAMF? Everything I read about this company indicates its a potential multibagger.

My analysis:

GRAMF is a cannabis holding company focusing on recreational cannabis products. Currently it consists of two lines: Caliva, a delivery-based recreational cannabis company, and Monogram, a luxury cannabis brand. 

Currently GRAMF trades at $6.00 and 96mio shares outstanding for a market cap of $575m.

GRAMFs market cap of $575m is tiny compared to most of the well-known cannabis stocks which are all 1bio+. It has huge room for upside growth.

GRAMF currently holds close to $300m just in cash. Compared to its $575m market cap, this implies GRAMF has a floor price of¬† $3.26 JUST based on cash alone!

MARKET SHARE

The cannabis market is currently particularly fragmented without any clear brand winner. For example, in california the top 10 cannabis brands only make up 30% total sales in the region. GRAMF has a good chance to emerge as a leader in this field for two reasons.

1. Star Power: GRAMF is partnered with Jay-Z and his company Roc Nation (With artists like Rihanna, Meek Mill, Alicia Keys, et al). This is a huge outlet for cheap mass marketing, celebrity endorsements, and promotion. This will cement GRAMF as a brand in consumers‚Äô minds.

2. M&A: GRAMF management indicates it plans to use its huge cash war chest to aggressively acquire competitors. These M&A deals will consolidate its foothold in the cannabis field and M&A news will also help spike GRAMF share price.

GROWTH

Recreational cannabis was just legalized in march 2021 in NY. This is a huge untapped market which GRAMF has indicated is a focus of expansion. With Jay-Z and his east coast reputation at the helm, GRAMF has a huge chance to become a brand name in the region. 

Federal legalization in 2021/2022 is a also potential catalyst for the cannabis sector as a whole. Cannabis legislation by all indications looks to be favorable under the current Biden administration and has bipartisan support. GRAMF is currently only traded OTC because current regulations do not allow cannabis stocks to be listed on exchanges. Once regulation reform comes and GRAMF gets listed, this will drive share prices up.

GRAMF has come off from its initial price of ~$11 when it first deSPAC‚Äôed to around $6 currently due to weak Q1 revenues and margins and its relative quietness currently. Its now trading quite cheaply compared to other cannabis stocks out there, and if it can post better Q2 numbers, make a splash in M&A, and builds up its general brand recognition, expect the share price to skyrocket.",nkpl9a,My DD on GRAMF: Waiting for takeoff?

With $30T visible debt and a 10% interest rate, the interest of $3T would bankrupt the government very fast.  If the fed wants to fight inflation they can remove a lot of cash (taper) from the system.  They might be able to do it without letting interest rates rise much.  This would signal the end of the bull market.  

In the end they have two choices: let inflation run wild or crush the markets.  Your opinion is inflation would be good for the markets indefinitely.  Not sure.  But I do believe that rampant inflation will cause a mad dash into precious metals and make them the next bubble.",,

You have understand that a great amount of the WSB population is legit retarded, and they just see the stock market where you either YOLO your house and become a millionaire or lose it all and become a hooker at Wendys.

That‚Äôs why I go here every day: around 20% to short hype plays (made a shitton this way), about 1% to find legit early long plays (extremely hard), 29% for the memes, and 50% for the shadenfreude (or however it‚Äôs spelled) of seeing people lose a ton of money in a stupid way.

But yeah, I do the same as you: 1-2% risk every time, fundamental analysis (mainly discounted cash flow to find true value), technical analysis (keep it simple, levels of structure, EMA50, MACD, and not much more) and the I either short or long according to my 1 or 2% risk. If the trade goes south, I take my 1-2% loss. If it goes right, I take my 2-3% gain (I usually go for 1.5 R/R).

For me, this is how I would look at it... For the one with the smallest strike, I am expect a 10% jump in price just to break even at expiration. None of the options are in the money yet. And nothing new will come out this week from them that will cause or justify the stock to keep climbing after it rose 50%+, and already has an oversold RSI. 

On each passing day, theta will eat up higher and higher, eventually wiping out all those ""gains"" you got in premiums. Unless you are deep in the money, and expect to exercise the options. I wouldn't hold. Lock in gains, and roll out in expiration dates.

1) Rats are also source of protein. Some even taste good (I tried). BBQ rat or snake is awesome.  
2) Your neighbors and your wife's boyfriend are good sources of protein. Just remember to be a polite cannibal if you go that way. Learn what parts of the body you can eat and iform yourself about kuru disease.  
3) If it moves it can be eaten. Said that, eating dog liver will kill you due to vitamin A overdose.

Other than that... I  think that the only thing you need to survive is a BBQ, a knife and a fork. you don't even need to go shopping. I see it as absolute win.",,

I bought GME 6/4 185p today, taking into consideration max pain theory for this week (170).

In the same time I have submitted a stop buy order at 205 in case of a bullish breakout (with potential upside to 250+)

What they have done is quite simply amazing. It's something we as humans should be celebrating not what the hedge funds or the ""big boys"" are doing. Trying to discourse, discourage and just make virgin galactic look bad. I strongly believe space is the future, the final frontier, everything that could be done for our species to become interplanetary should be encouraged. So,

The real goal of China is to control all the software that is in the EV cars.

What equity investors might be not seeing is that LTMAQ is under chapter 11 and its bonds are in default, still the sr unsec ones are trading around 95% of par. So, the laws in Chile and in the whole Latin America is way different that US bankruptcy laws. Last week I saw one news comparing LATAM Airlines situation as the new HERTZ where equity jumped from 1 to 6 usd once they restructured the company. The price action can be similar but the reasons will be different. There is now way that shareholders will loose its company to unsecured creditors, not in any Emerging Market country. So, if bonds are trading close to 100% of its par, why the equity is still between 25 - 30% of pre covid levels? Probably they will swap this debt into some convertible bond which in the end you might get diluted as an equity holder, but still I would assume at least 5 usd for this stock even in the event of a dilution, because we will be talking about a leader company in the region well positioned for the recovery and free of debt.
