You’re paying more today than GameStop in its PRIME back in 2006, nearly DOUBLE, yet sales are nearly 50% less and profits are down 70%. 

They will drain cash and end up in bankruptcy again. People buy games from the console. People buy consoles from Walmart. fundamentals always play out in the long run.

The weekly options put into play last week IMO has pushed out a spike that I think would've happened within the next week or two. MM have been keeping price between 13-15 to keep most of calls out of the money. Shorts can only go based on sentiment. There is no news now other than possible Russell index inclusion. Shareholder meeting yesterday showed clear direction. 

Fee borrow 36.3% with 85k shares available when typing this now its down to 7k available(40 cent drop). Dark pool still shows a negative balance. 

IMO I think mvis is bound to go up rather than down",,

Id love some leagues hosted by gme , a bit like sports leagues, in every neighborhood,  than scaling up to city tournaments and national and so on. 

It could become the leagues for all introvert kids. Mixing physical , social interactions to the world of gaming. 

Would be a great way to set up peons all accross the board, to bring the next step, a revolution the esports by making them mainstream. 

Imagine, as a parent, finally having a place for your introvert kids to make friends while praticing a sport they like rather than forcing them into soccer even if they hate it. Then, imagine , at school, some rivalries between kids. It would become a greatly talked subject, would draw more attention, bring in more players. I see exponential growth going that way. 

And gme being gme, can then stream events, have subscription revenues from the league, partnerships, sponsorships from gaming companies.

They would have multiple revenue streams, and at the same time would be advertising of products they sell. 

In the long run, theyre known as the place where so many kids discovered this passion and lived so many émotions and made friends, which means, a lot of customers who trust the company. And they end up being the leaders of all of it. After all, once these kids grow up, lots of them are still going to be gamers and they will now have jobs and money and will need some hardware and software for their gaming purposes at home. Guess who sells all of this? Their beloved gme, where it all started. 

It may be a stretch but i really see à bright future for gme in the industry.",,

The company is the largest independent transporter of refiner products \~6800 miles of refined product pipelines and \~3100 miles of crude pipelines.

Kinder Morgan is also the largest independent terminal operator with 144 terminals & 16 Jones Act vessels. These together enabled the company to increase natural gas income during the Texas storm, something that wasn't a one-off. The company is the largest CO2 transporter with \~1.5 bcf/day of capacity, showing its strength.

* Kinder Morgan benefited off of the Texas Storm with its DCF expected to reach almost $6 billion for the year.
* The company has a dividend of almost 6% and it's continuing to invest in its business for the long run.
* The company has an impressive and diverse portfolio of assets which we expect it'll be able to utilize to drive substantial long-term shareholder rewards.

2180,,2021-05-26 19:34:02,t3_nlpfk9,,wallstreetbets,"I must start this with do not touch your AMC for anything let alone a stock that hasnt even cemented itself in this new world - but the memeconemy is having a revival and with Wall St's apparent dislike of this company through shorts I think UWMC may have a nice place in this new order.

EDIT: short TLDR by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can’t fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It’s a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \(high short float\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",nlpfk9,UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me

They will never cure anything, but for kids with muscular distrophy just keeping them from getting worse is as good as a cure.  Cathy Wood took a position and exited it fairly quickly, before the most recent good data.  If they can retrace even half of the move down from earlier this year it would be a big gain.

Black berry’s forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let’s start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It’s essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars’ software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla’s self driving cars, they’ll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It’s confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It’s cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That’s $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

This stock is a deep fucking value",nlqklx,A Deep Fucking Value: Why BB is More Than Just a Short Squeeze; And Why It’s Worth $100 A Share

TLDR --Premise-- ViaSat, Inc (VSAT) is a mediocre company that provides mediocre satellite service that costs way too much for what it is.... but in many places it is the ONLY option... well it was until Mr. 🚀 himself decided to eat their lunch. StarLink (part of SpaceX) is about to absolutely destroy VSAT and turn it to 💩.

TLDR --Strategy-- since you can't invest in SpaceX (private company) or Starlink (until it is spun off into a separate entity **and then DO invest there** ) I think someone that decides to buy PUTS on VSAT (give yourself A LOT of time, I'm talking June 2022 $35 or Jan 2023 $25) stands to make a lot of money ------ I'm personally not starting my position until right before the next earnings report in August. I figure the first sign of trouble will come out in an earnings report and if it isn't August then by November it'll start showing. Again **LONG** duration puts. Looking to catch that cycle when the company drops 50% on the bad news. If it goes up between now and then I'll just buy MORE puts. 

**NOT A PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL PERSON - INVEST AT YOUR OWN RISK - I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE BUT I MAY BE 🤪🤪🤪🤪 PERSON WHO EATS 💩 FOR ALL YOU KNOW**

details

**ViaSat - How it started**

Market cap of 3.26 Billion, share price of $47.55 when I'm writing this. It got as high as the 90's before the pandemic book the shins out of the market and dropped it to $28. Since recovered a bit to... as I said $47.55

They have some satellites in space that allow people with a receiver dish to get internet from space like some kind of awesome scifi movie.... except the internet is crazy expensive for what you get. Their satellites are pretty high up and that means each one can cover a BIG area. They only seem to have a handful, maybe a dozen? But they offer pretty broad coverage and are expanding it. BUT because the satellites are high up the latency (time between your computer and your internet source or something like that) is high leading to slow speeds and overall not a great service.

They already have airlines as customers, expanding recently with Delta. Their is VERY LITTLE competition in this business and between airlines, cruise lines and rural home owners with no other option they make a nice amount of money. Totally solid business model. Internet is ever more and more important and usage on air planes and boats is only gonna go up. In fact like a lot of articles on VSAT I would probably say this is a good medium / long term buy and that is why the median price target is $67 ***EXCEPT*** I know something that the market doesn't seem to have realized yet.

>EDITED BASED ON COMMENTS  
>  
>ViaSat does have commercial business beyond airlines and cruises; I would imagine rural businesses and some VERY LARGE corporations that use it for specific use cases. There is also the DOD which they have contracts with.  
>  
>  
>  
>**I AM NOT ASSERTING THAT VIA SAT WILL GO COMPLETELY OUT OF BUSINESS.**  
>  
>  
>  
>However, while a viable company may exist beyond the coming reckoning I expect the market to react extremely negatively to ViaSat losing **ALL** of their rural residential and rural small and medium size business customers. I'm also thinking that right around the time that starts sinking in news stories about cruise lines and air lines switching over to StarLink will start popping up and again, $VSAT go **💩.** I honestly hope VSAT does go up to the current target of the mid $60's because I'll start buying puts a small chunk at a time as it rises. Until then I'm waiting till August, right before next quarterly earnings report to start my position.

**StarLink - How it's going**

as you may the Dogefather happens to have a small 🚀 company. Its called SpaceX and they aren't publicly traded. They also are doing to the aerospace / orbit supply and transport industry what many of us wish Tesla could fully due to the fossil fuel industry. SpaceX's Falcon9 🚀 is all sorts of amazing - mainly because it isn't thrown out after each use ($40MM in savings for each subsequent use of a booster).

StarLink is a division of SpaceX that is focused on bringing internet to the whole 🌎 using a crazy amount of satellites. Like... A LOT. Unlike ViaSat which has a few the StarLink constellation (thats what they call a network of satellites) has 16 HUNDRED and they are launching 60 at a time every week or so (sometimes more than once a week). Because StarLink has access to this game changing super cheap 🚀 transportation AND Musk is doing is usual weirdness by mass producing these satellites and focusing on cost and volume instead of making them SUPER DUPER reliable

Some of you may remember how TSLA was this tiny company that was prob gonna die etc. etc. and THEN 💥💥 there are Model 3's and Model Y's EVERYWHERE. Well StarLink is gonna have that moment soon. Sometime in the next few months there will suddenly be high-ish speed internet (between 50mbs and 100mbs) literally ANYWHERE on the planet for $500 down and $100 a month. Way better product and on an annualized basis way better value.",nlsu85,First real post on WSB - found a walking zombie 🧟 and wanted to share... I bring you a tale of.... $VSAT

# 5/27 Outlook

Today's price 🎯 still hold for tomorrow. *(theta starting to take away some of my credibility if I have to keep moving these targets back...)*

Note from [Spot Gamma](https://spotgamma.com/): *""We are looking for another low volatility session tomorrow with 4200 being the key area in play. Low VIX/implied vol could start to add a tailwind to equities as options decay and dealers buy back short hedges.""*

Could positive unemployment numbers and leading economic index reading give SPY the tailwind it needs to reach ATH?

* If 417.25 breaks, look for bearish 🎯 : 416 - 415 - 414.13 - 412.74 - 411.26 - 410

Performance can only be measured through the entire cycle.    The entire Cycle exposes you from all angles. 

The human brain tends to become infected with greed at the end of a big Stage 2 run (see digital  virtuals  for current example) thus causing people to lose money after a bull market because they expect it to go on forever.

  Understanding Stage Analysis can help you overcome this

2208,,2021-05-26 23:30:49,t3_nlugr7,,wallstreetbets,"CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Wednesday he’s not sure why any investors are still betting against GameStop and AMC Entertainment, two of the so-called meme stocks popular on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum.
.
.
The “Mad Money” host made his comments following a session in which GameStop shares rose almost 16% Wednesday and AMC advanced 19%. The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.
.
.
“Anyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,” Cramer said.
.
.
Despite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC — which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming — is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.
.
.
But Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.
.
.
Shorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.
.
.
When the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.
.
.
Both GameStop and AMC have over 20% of their float shares sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. That’s compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock.
.
“I’ve never seen anything like this: a group of buyers with no sensitivity to price,” Cramer said. “These people don’t have unlimited firepower, but they’ve got enough firepower to engineer a short-squeeze any time a bunch of professionals decide to bet against this thing.”
.
.
“These people don’t have unlimited firepower…”

I don’t want to share with you something that you all heard so many times (yep, I haven't lost my fate in humanity) like avoid margin trading or invest in mutual funds. I believe I have some wisdom I wish I had from the beginning.

1. Trading is just 5% theory and 95% about emotional control, risk and money management, overcoming one’s greed, having strict stoploss and targets predefined before taking a trade.
2. Don’t follow advice from forums blindly. Build your own map of the world. Each of us learn to trade at our own pace and don’t get discouraged if you find that after a few years, you’re still struggling to master the ‘money game’. You can keep in mind different advice from experienced players (e.g. I recommend this qooore app and it's discord community), *but it's vital for the final decision to be yours*.
3. Accept losses and do not make investment decisions based on emotion Especially greed, fear, or panic. Yep, you didn’t buy Betcoin (lol couldn't resist) at 3,000$ because you didn’t know back than what direction the price would take. No regrets. Keep yourself focused on here and now, move ahead
4. Know yourself. What is your current financial situation? Why you are investing? For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully.
5. Never forget that for investing, time is your best friend - and greed is your worst enemy. Patience is a requirement in stock trading. There are no short-cuts or ‘holy grail’ when it comes to stock. And you only need to have couple of strategies but those should be well tested and made perfect over the period of time.

To me, trading is a skill that requires 3Ls - ‘Life-Long Learning”.

Stay humble, be honest and willing to admit your mistakes in trading and don’t try to rationalise and explain mistakes away, and always remain teachable and never think you’ve ‘arrived’.",nlvay0,After 3 years of learning investment: my 5 tips for those who just started

2217,,2021-05-27 01:00:08,t3_nlw3ty,,wallstreetbets,"Hi Everyone! I did some research on cinema stocks a while back and made a video on it. I didn't post the content here so I thought I would share it as I know everyone is interested in AMC at the moment! I know it's a lot to read so if you prefer to watch the video, the link for that is also included below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s)

Why Cinema Stocks like AMC will benefit from reopening? 

Time-Frame: Cinema’s will benefit from reopening and the economic recovery that is occurring all over the world. Especially over a longer timeframe.  I think that Cinemas can be a good trade in the medium term and can help you make money. It’s all dependent on data and how quickly things go back to normal, but my timeframe on this trade right now is 1-2 years. Maybe even shorter, perhaps 6 months if we bounce back very quickly. Maybe not the most likely, but still a possible scenario that I have to consider. 

&#x200B;

Thesis: 

1)  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a very strong negative impact on the cinema sector. So, naturally as things reopen and vaccinations increase all over North America, these companies stand to benefit. If we look back from the end of January 2020 to the end of April 2021, Marcus Corporation was down approximately 33% from January 27th, 2020. Cinemark is down approximately 35% over the same time period, while National CineMedia is down almost 42% and AMC is up almost 57%. Price is an important factor to consider when buying and selling stocks and this something that is important to consider 

2) Cinemas have suffered tremendously with the Covid-19 pandemic, which makes the cinema sector intriguing as the world re-opens. If we look to Asia, especially China and Japan, where Covid-19 cases subsided and theatres reopened, things look promising.  There was a substantial increase in demand, with demand actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. In China, December 2020 ticket sales at IMAX’s big-screen theatres jumped 28 per cent from a year earlier, while in Japan, they broke daily records and a record number of people saw movies on the first weekend of January 2021. Clearly, there was a lot of pent-up demand which surfaced and benefitted movie theatres in Asia. 

3) And you know what I’ve seen this film before. Last year early in February, there was a sudden spike in downloads of the Zoom app in China, and the stock at that was point already doing well, up roughly 30 percent from the start of the year. But this spike in Zoom usage soon spread all over the world, and the rest is history. It was an absolutely humungous winner last year. There are obviously sector wide risks with consumer preferences changing, and more and more people preferring to watch films at home. The increase in Netflix & streaming service subscribers over the years is a clear indication of consumer preferences going-forward, but I do like movie theatres as a trade. There is a lot of pent-up demand that I feel will benefit the sector. 

Risks: 

\-  One of the main risks that that most people who are considering trading or investing in cinema companies have, is the risk from Netflix and the other streaming services. Really the risk of the Direct-to-consumer approach and the effects that it will have on the cinema companies. And this is a valid concern because it has reduced demand for cinemas over the last decade. Even some of the biggest filmmakers in the world are turning to it, like Martin Scorsese, Noah Baumbach and Alfonso Cuaron.  Netflix has become the biggest movie studio in the world, at-least when it comes to volume in terms of production over the last several years. And now they plan to release 50-60 films per year, and with their pioneering Direct to Consumer approach, the film industry has changed. Cinemas are no longer at the forefront, and the Direct-to-Consumer strategy is quickly becoming the new incumbent. The DTC approach is taking over, with all the streaming services that have launched. They have taken market share from linear television and have steered consumers away from traditional Cinema.

Catalysts & Conclusion: 

1) However, I still think there is still a place for theatres, even with streaming, especially looking at the same timeframe that I’m focusing on for this trade. I think now more so than ever people want to be outside. These businesses will benefit from the change in near term consumer trends, with everyone wanting to leave the house. I really believe that the cinema sector is going to do well in North America. If Asia is anything to go by and I think it is, some of the companies involved in the sector have the potential to be great trades. People still want to go to the cinemas, especially when it comes to seeing some of the big budget films that are really made for the big screen. Blockbuster action films with awesome effects are really meant to be seen in a movie theatre in my opinion. The effects and the environment simply cannot be replicated at home. Especially when it comes to immersive experience films, like those with IMAX and 4DX. I really enjoy the cinema and think there is something to be said for being in a big space in a dark room watching a film 40 feet across. It is wonderful to sit in the comfort of your own home but there is just something to be said for having a community experience in a room. But that’s neither there nor here. 

  
2) Moving on, another potential catalyst is the potential for collaboration between theatre chains and streaming services. Netflix was the one to pioneer the Direct to Consumer, but interestingly they have begun releasing some Netflix Originals on the big screen in recent years. Films like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes all premiered in Cinemas prior to their appearance in Netflix’s online catalogue.  This is a really interesting move on their part, especially from an investment perspective. Because, while you can watch streaming services in the comfort of your own home, movie theatre companies are open to the idea of having the films that are produced by the streaming services shown in their theatres. Cinemark has shown Netflix movies in theatres in the past, and there is an off chance that they expand their agreement. This wouldn’t just apply to Cinemark but other theatre chains as well potentially. The big hold-up between the streaming services and theatre chains was the disagreement on the length of theatrical window. But last year, Universal Studios and Cinemark, AMC & Cineplex agreed to a shortened exclusive window, from 74 days to 31 days for major films, as defined by box-office domestic revenue. This makes it more likely that Netflix and other streaming services can find middle ground with the cinema companies. It’s not all that important a catalyst for the trade, nor is it all that likely, but it is still intriguing and something to consider.

3) A more important catalyst is the release of the next James Bond film, no time to die next year. I’m really excited about the movie because I’m a huge James Bond fan. It’s probably my favourite movie series. And you know what, I’m not alone. It’s very popular all over the world. The previous James Bond film, Spectre, grossed nearly $879 million. No Time To Die has been postponed several times due to the pandemic and is due to premiere on October 8th in the United States. I’m really excited about the movie and will be sure to see in theatres provided it’s safe to do so. And I think it will be. This movie is really important for the movie theatres because they have been starved and there have just been very few films to show. They have been supply constrained with the lack of new films. No Time To Die is a certain blockbuster and will really help benefit the sector. 

4) Something else that has me really excited is the recent CDC news in the US, with them updating guidance on April 2nd that fully vaccinated people can travel internationally safely and don’t need to quarantine when they return provided, they test negative within three to five days of their return. They have to test negative before they are allowed to board a return flight to the US. This is really exciting, and this combined with the idea of a vaccine passport as has been proposed by cruise lines and the UK government really provide a lot of momentum for the cinema companies.

2218,,2021-05-27 01:24:58,t3_nlwjwy,,wallstreetbets,"I will try to keep this short and sweet.
In my view the following points are justifiable:
-The VW emissions hack was not an effort to destroy the environment. 
-It was trolling done by VW officials bc they were tired of having the EPA’s pozzed dick in their asses regarding diesel emission regulations on diesel imports. 
-VW was tired of the EPA because:

     A.  In europe diesel autos make up over half of    
           all car engines. 
     B.  Cars like the Euro-version VW golf wagon      
           get almost 90 mpg. Compare that to the 
           Toyota Prius that gets 40mpg at best. 
     C.  The EPA doesnt want VW to import a 90    
           MPG diesel car to the US because it would    
           kill US auto sales, so the EPA makes diesel 
           regulations so strict that the only diesels 
           VW et. al. can import only manage 45 MPG. 
     D.  And if you want to make things fair, the 
           highest MPG diesel electric hybrid made by 
           VW gets over 200 MPG. 
     E.  Europeans aren’t idiots: they aren’t willingly 
          “poisoning themselves” with diesel fumes. 
          Diesel is just as clean as gas and burning 
          1 gallon of diesel fuel every 90 miles is 
          better for the environment than burning 1 
          gallon of gas every 30 miles. 
     F.  The “smelly/black fume producing” 
          reputation of diesel in america owes itself to 
          idiot US auto makers that in the 80’s tried to 
          make frankenstein diesel engines out of 
          modified gas engines and they ran like shit 
          and spewed black smoke. These atrocities    
          were unlike the clean running diesel engines 
          that were being produced in Germany at the 
          same time. 
-In summary, the EPA has been punishing European Auto makers (VW) for American auto makers’ past engineering disgraces, and when VW officials got tired of being unfairly punished they decided to troll the EPA with an emissions hack. 
-They did it to slam some jimmies, not to gain      
profit or destroy the environment. 
-German authorities know this, which is why they released key players like Oliver Schmidt who was let out on parole right after he was transferred from US prison to German authorities. 
-The loss of stock value that occured from the scandal was unjustified then, and the stagnation of VW stock price since then has been unjustified in light of the fact that VW’s P/E in the last 3 months has been between 50-70 times lower than that of Tesla, and historically it has been foolish to underestimate the ability of Volkswagen to perform at the cutting edge of the industry. 
-The Emissions hack has nothing negative to say about Volkswagens fierce engineering capability and in my view it has something positive to say about the youthfulness and creativity of the company.

Retail shorts have hopped on the bandwagon and when stocks move they tend to over shoot the upside and the downside. 

Sundial has over $1 billion in cash, no debt, positive operating profit, and many valuable passive investments. 

The manipulation that the stock received was absolutely insane. Institutional ownership was less than 2% when SNDL made it’s run in Feb and the big boys didn’t want to miss the party and they paid motley fool to write bash articles while they accumulate their position. This is just my assumption, which is never a good thing when valuing stocks, but as a former stock analyst I would bet that institutional ownership will be over 5% very soon and then 10%. 

SNDL is breaking out with insane call volume bought today expiring Friday. This company has the fundamentals to back it up and very good things could be coming.

1. Commercial Passenger Flights:

They expect to fly 25 commercial flights in 2022, with six passengers each, which means 150 passengers for 2022.

Ticket cost is around $250k, which translates into revenues of approximately $37.5 million from Commercial Passengers in 2022

2. Additional Revenue:

Besides commercial passengers, the company has also generated some revenue by carrying payloads into space in recent years. Assuming that this will grow to about $12 million by 2022, total revenues would stand at $50 million for the year.

3) Revenue Per Share

Revenue Per Share is likely to grow to about $0.21 in 2022, assuming total shares outstanding of 234 million.

4. Value Per Share

With a sales multiple of about 70 (contains a certain amount of goodwill), it translates into a stock price of about  $15 per Share.

The current share price is $27 per Share. Assuming the assumptions are correct, this explains the current short ratio of 25%.",nm0tqe,"Is Virgin Galactic stock expensive, fair, or cheap priced?"

**Shorting $GLD**

$GLD mostly follows real rates and then the $. 

What has allowed $GLD to prosper recently has been :

a) Ever dovish FED decreasing nominal rates as much as they can via their speeches & slower than expected job gains which have cemented FED forecasts

b) Ever rising inflation expectations due to faulty base effects that are transitory

c) Some impact from Crapto crash with money flowing back into $GLD (some of it at least :/)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I think there has been a gestalt shift on all three items 

a) FED's Clarida & Quarles yesterday have both suggested the beginning of tapering discussions 

> Late yesterday, the Fed’s Quarles said “it will become important for the FOMC to begin discussing our plans to adjust the pace of asset purchases at upcoming meetings.” Quarles is the Fed’s Vice Chair for Supervision and it is unusual for him to comment on monetary policy.

aBis) The NFP last month was a serious miss but it's not gonna be repeated : as schools reopen and UIs are not extended in a lot of states, the slaves will go back to finding a slave master before jobs run out. employers have also adjusted somewhat with regards to wage expectations already which should make for a much more balanced jobs market going into the begining of school season

b) Inflation (in CPI sense) has peaked in April or will peak now, Commos have crashed thanks to our lords and saviors, the ccp tightening margins and putting an end to this story. 

c) Crapto stabilized

What a day yesterday, but as expected per my last DD. The question now is since MVIS is sub $15 - will the downward movement continue or will the stock stagnate around $15 for awhile?

Looking at the usual metrics, the only thing that can significantly answer this question is the placement of options for now. This is because:

https://preview.redd.it/61qdor9stn171.png?width=2228&format=png&auto=webp&s=01556f96df70c1f4293f70b4f707763e2594640d

There is reasonable protection from dealer gamma - but this can be a double-edged sword if it rises too quickly too much. But in this case, a marginal decrease with a significant price drop is a relatively good sign .

The price, despite its drop, ended about where it was expected to (at the lower band of expectation):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7oiku922un171.png?width=2192&format=png&auto=webp&s=72d134ddb771c880e75591ac8beab90417ac896a

https://preview.redd.it/u3elpj34un171.png?width=2120&format=png&auto=webp&s=df325eb5f5650313c6dac91446c37681c21f333c

https://preview.redd.it/xxfkrp55un171.png?width=2168&format=png&auto=webp&s=280b23f69b58e948fb500e0da0877a5e9677137a

The options landscape hasn't changed that much, relatively speaking. The price moved down below the largest chunk of calls at $15, again as expected.

So in attempting to divine the future, one must ask: are there any forces at play that are more significant than the others? The answer: currently - no, but the cliff is near.

Take a peak at these metrics:

https://preview.redd.it/022b4ildun171.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=3895f4fb62252b9f4e3b9a2a9949f025598675fe

These are the number of shares (assuming all dealer intermediary) that must be bought or sold per combination of price / IV increase.

MVIS is in the uncomfortable position where *any increase in IV will result in selling*. This is unusual and slightly unhealthy. 

So MVIS seems entirely contingent currently on liquidity: if it remains low, then it will probably waiver around $15 until big upstream moves are made. If IV begins to rise, than a cycle of selling could be initiated. Per the options, if this happens, the only 'floor' of sorts would be around $10 with the \~18k Puts.

Morning everyone. This post is by no way detailed with statistics or a deep dive into the company, this is just something I have been watching over the past 6 months as a very active social media user. Draftkings has 3-4 active Twitter accounts. The main one of coarse being simply @ Draftkings with 320K folowers (@ Fanduel only has 254k but who is keeping score) . Anyway, as Draftkings rolls out new programs like Sports Betting (@ DKSportsbook) or Casino (@ DKCasino) and you can get a pretty good idea of what the company will be doing or acting like by simply scrolling down their feed.

Well if you have a minute, I suggest you scroll down the Twitter feed of @ DKCasino. They only have 200 posts or so since they are relatively new but you can see that when they started posting late last year, and literally only being live in a handful of states, they had free money promotions with almost no interaction. But now, especially the past month or so, you will notice every one of their tweets is now 

1) a direct advertisement of one of their games that you can currently play

2)a sign up promotion 

3) interactions with a player who has won money. 

4) starting to have 30+ comments on every tweet. 

I think #3 is the key to the future. When investing in Draftkings everyone including myself constantly thinks ""Sports betting"" which we can all agree is a young mans/woman's game. Very few, including myself, have realized that Draftkings will be using all its power of brand name, player connection and social media to delivery a full LEGAL casino to your iPhone. The last sentence is simply fact, as I stated @ Draftkings twitter account has 320K followers, the @ DKCasino only has..... 2607 followers. YUP, thats IT, only TWO THOUSAND followers so far. I think this is a huge reason institutional investors like Blackrock or ARK are going in head first. They are buying a fully legal casino delivered to your door. You know those busses they run out of retirement homes into Casinos and back 3 times a week? Well why on earth would those old people spend hours on busses when the future of Casinos is a Draftkings app on a 24 inch Ipad screen in their rooms? 

Now you say "" Hey buddy, what does Draftkings know about casinos when they will be competing with PENN or MGM or WYNN. And in a sense you are right. But for a second, lets look at that retirement home scenario. Draftkings has NO brick and mortar casinos. Unlike PENN or MGM. Who benefits more from your grandmother NOT taking the free shuttle bus to the brick Casino, PENN/MGM who make money either way, or Draftkings who spends 0.0 $ on storefronts, employees, and every penny that Grandma spends playing in her room is 100% PURE profit taken away from PENN or MGM. 

Everyone keeps focusing on the amount of money Draftkings has spent on customer acquisition lately. That is the reason the stock price is down. Well if you think of them acquiring future Casino customers that they are taking away from PENN, MGM and WYNN. It makes more sense of why they are spending so hard.",nm7muv,Peak into the future with Draftkings

I really really like the setup on this one as it's broken out of the weekly downward trend line and has found support over 15 a share. I bought options that go until Jan of 2022 to hopefully give me enough time for the weed stock hype to come back before the spring legislative session of 2022 in which I expect Congress to pass their federal legalization bill. I could get lucky and it might be introduced this summer which would be ideal. But even if not the chart and price action suggests to me that $20 a share is completely possible even without legislative catalyst.

2256,,2021-05-27 13:47:48,t3_nm7ug7,,wallstreetbets,"Look at the short interest, GME was listed at 17% - AMC was 21% 

UWMC is now 22% + with 100% borrow fees

Did you know TODAY it was added to the MSCI index !? Major bullish catalyst 

In about 10 days it goes EX DIV, which means shorts have to PAY that dividend if they don’t cover. Also, Russell index inclusion will be announced at the same time. 

AMC and GME both are selling hundreds of millions of dollars in stock / UWMC is BUYING hundreds of millions of dollars in stock. Yes CEO announced a buy back that could eliminate 44% of the float ($300M)


Did I mention while you wait for a squeeze to the moon you collect about a 5% dividend? 


Options - look at the options ! Not only is there an insane amount of Open Interest, but there is no premium in the calls. You can buy $5 calls all the way out to DEC within 5 cents of current stock price.  Meaning you can go big and buy time, for almost zero premium. 

This is the real play. If UWMC had 1/10 of the volume AMC did yesterday it would have MOONED. It can happen. 🚀💸

This is not financial advice, but it could be a good time to take some gains and actually put them to good use !!

So this is a legitimate stat - 100k SNDL $1 call options were bought yesterday by retail investors. Whoever was selling $1 strike options expiring this Friday for a penny, you are so greedy and there’s a good chance you’re about to get your face ripped off.  
  
Retail shorts have hopped on the bandwagon and when stocks move they tend to over shoot the upside and the downside.  
  
Sundial has over $1 billion in cash, no debt, positive operating profit, and many valuable passive investments.  
  
The manipulation that the stock received was absolutely insane. Institutional ownership was less than 2% when SNDL made it’s run in Feb and the big boys didn’t want to miss the party and they paid motley fool to write bash articles while they accumulate their position. This is just my assumption, which is never a good thing when valuing stocks, but as a former stock analyst I would bet that institutional ownership will be over 5% very soon and then 10%.  
  
SNDL is breaking out with insane call volume bought today expiring Friday. This company has the fundamentals to back it up and very good things could be coming. Not to mention it’s a prime acquisition target with its super strong balance sheet.",,

* FTD cycles continue to create squeeze pressure.  FTD's are trending down however suggesting as they keep getting punished, stupid hedgies do have to recoil at least a little bit.  There is likely some naked shorting still going on, but I think this is greatly exaggerated.

* Vote recall.  Similar to above.  It may reveal some naked shorting but I don't believe price goes to $10M.  However I gave myself 3 extra weeks after the shareholder meeting.  Even if price goes to $10M, it doesn't stay there for very long, if anything it will be insanely brief.  But yea I don't think it even ever goes there.

* Non-fungible tokens creates a new narrative.  This might also help but I don't think it is enough to keep convincing new investors to FOMO at higher and higher prices.",,

AMC is on a spectacular run but curious if anyone on here also investing in CINEDIGM!   


Cinedigm Corp. engages in the marketing and distribution of movie, television, and other short form content managing a library of distribution rights. It operates through the segments; Cinema Equipment Business, and Content and Entertainment Business (CEG). The Cinema Equipment Business segment consists of the non-recourse, financing vehicles, and administrators. The Content and Entertainment Business refers to ancillary market aggregation and distribution of entertainment content and, branded and over-the-top (OTT) digital network business providing entertainment channels and applications.   


Essentially, their a film projection business. I only have a few shares but been noticing it going up today. I am not a financial advisor but you might get a few extra bananas with the AMC run. Just a theory!",,

At the end of the day until our spending gets under control and the fed stops printing money at the rate that it is to fund these spending projects, the dollar will continue to be weak which is good for Gold. It’s not all about inflation, and the data shows that it’s actually not really a great hedge against inflation in the long run. Stocks actually provide the best hedge against inflation. Also people seeing crypto have 30% overnight collapses hurts its attempt at becoming the full fledged digital gold, which is part of the reason for the recent rally as you mentioned. At the very least I think we will see Gold hit all time highs before backing off if it can’t break the resistance. You should check the technical set up right now it’s pretty bullish at least until we retest highs, which maybe would then provide a good opportunity to buy puts for a pullback.",,

Cost of buying those options was 50 cents per share or $250 total. I don't think the OP wants or plans to buy it for 40 but the play seems to be that as the price goes up, the ""value"" (what he could sell it for/what it would cost someone else to buy it) of the option increases. As of the time of the post, the value per share went from $0.50 to $1.15 (so the options he paid $250 for, he could sell for $575, hence the $325 profit). The closer the AMC prices gets to 40 the more the options will be worth because the greater the chances it goes above 40 and ends up in the money for the call holder (e.g. a $40 call when stock is $35 is going to cost a lot more then when stock is $15 and a long shot to ever get to $40). If I understand this correctly, and noob here so just learning how options strategies work, the play is to sell it before it expires and take the profits from selling the call option, not to hope it gets above $40 and exercise the option.  Similarly, with the $15 call - which cost more than 3x to buy (i.e. 1.55 vs. 0.50), the ""value"" of the call option has already increased to $6.15 (an increase of $4.60 per share or $4,600 per option contract since 1 option is 100 shares). OP has 115 contracts (11,500 shares) and so the profit he could get right now from selling the option contracts is $4.60 x 11,500 (which is what the $52,900 represents).  In simpler terms, you buy a call option, hope the stock goes way up, thereby increasing the cost of the same call option, and sell that option before it expires and take the profit.  IF I'M WRONG SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME - DOING THIS MORE TO SEE IF I UNDERSTAND THIS.",,

But I agree. This has dangerous rug pull written all over it. The thesis of a $100k floor is fundamentally wrong and a lot of the people counting on it are new. Anyone who bought in anywhere near $20 is in rough waters.

The sole redeeming piece of the $100k floor is that 80% of the shares are held by retail. I wouldn’t count on it, but this price could really climb if buying holds and selling from the holders stops. Again, your piece about the restricted selling certainly hurts that.

But the thing is, every time this happens.... this IS “a squeeze”.

There is not limit as for the amount of times something can squeeze if there is enough force behind the stock, but there is a limit on how high it can get, and you’ll be holding bags... again lol (and again).

A support is when a stock falls down and reaches, people tend to buy more then sell. 

Think of supports like “floors” and supports as “roofs”.

So as a stock keeps hitting the roof, eventually it breaks it and moves to the next room upwards. That roof that broke becomes the floor and the new roof is higher. It works both ways.

So if we take: 

Support below 
-5.5% at 26.65 +\- 1.23 type single, strength 1: this means that if the stock drops 5.5% many people will start to buy it. The +/- is just a range. 

Strength means how strong the floor/wall is, meaning the volume people buy/sell at.

Type is how often it was tested…",,

I am personally just confident that AMC will have a sustainable business model that can generate revenue and healthy growth.

Movie theaters are reopening now so money is going back into theaters.

I personally believe that AMC could reinvent itself and jump into the streaming platform business competing with Netflix, Amazon etc.

That's the most logical approach for me.

Movies aren't going anywhere or do you see a world where everyone watches nee movies form their tiny TV at home?

I really don't believe that.

That's just my take on that, that's why I bought it at the very low, before all the AMC and GME madness. Hope this helped",,

You pay a fee which gives you an option.

The option you gain is whether you want to buy 100 shares or not.

You buy the 100 shares at a set price depending on which option you paid a fee for.

If you choose the option to not to buy the 100 shares, you're still out the fee.

If you choose the option to buy the 100 shares, you get to buy the 100 shares at the set price that you paid a fee for.

Then you turn around and sell the shares. Or not.

You can also sell your option to someone else. Like if you don't have the money to buy the 100 shares.

1) call option you are expecting the price to go up.
2) puts option you are expecting to go down.

long term options the price will be more but give you have longer time in market.
 short term options the price will be cheaper but you have less time in market.

Also the price depends on volatility of the stock.

Expiry time: the time your contract expires, before it expires you need to do either of these two.

1) sell your contract, don’t wait till the end you can only sell if there is some one to buy it. If you wait on the last day the chances are you won’t be able to sell it.

2) exercise the contract: which mean based on you contract you would have said I will buy the stock at $9 if it goes up $15. You can only do this if it’s goes above $15( which is your break even price)",,

By your logic, UWMC at 21% SI/FF and 50-100% loan rates is a better squeeze target. Free float is similar, but there’s actually upside left.

There is a premium/charge per contract) so you may pay 5.00 per 100 contracts. in this example you’d be making money if F exceeds 21$ (the 16$ call + 5.00 charge)

Puts - pretty much the opposite of calls where you are expecting a stock price to fall and gives the option to sell (put) the stock a specific strike price. (Same ex: F is 14.99 but think it’s going to drop. You buy a put option to sell F at 12.99 at 2.00 per 100)... if the stock price drops below 10.99 (12.99-2.00) you make profit

I saw that it was trending down and bought a lot of options on the chance we'd get a turnaround so like when it was $10/share.  If you jump into Meme stocks right now you should expect to lose and have a $1000 lesson.  I would recommend starting with something safe and easy that you're not going to have these types of swings.  It will give you an opportunity to learn about the greets and what time decay is and IV.  Youtube learning options to get the basics and go onto /r/options to buy some safe ones at first.  I'd get into something like FCX or MT that are companies doing extremely well this year and most likely going to go up slowly and actually give you a higher probability of a win.  This $$ I invested was completely disposable income and I was willing to lose all of it.  Get an account on Fidelity, NOT ROBINHOOD, and apply for options and throw $1,000 into it and I can DM you and try to help you find some options that expire in like September which will give you a few months to see it go up and down.  I got extremely lucky here and have taken all of my initial investment and am just letting my profit ride the wave right now.  I'm not a stock broker just a dumb ape that wants to stick it to the man.",,
