Because H2 will inevitably be supplied (right now it's 95% of H2 supply) by natural gas the through steam-methane reforming process. This requires both high heat and high pressure--energetically expensive, and must be factored into the efficiency.

This is guaranteed to be the predominant force in H2 production, should it ever reach a matured market because oil majors have the most money to buy politicians with. This is a law of nature that also must be factored into the calculation. This analysis cannot fail to take into account Big Energy's grip on policy, just by virtue of the system of legalized bribery--in the US and everywhere else billionaires run the country.

So there's the energy to get H2 from NG. The by-products: H2O, CO, CO2. Transport costs to the gas stations, more GHG into the system. Then the efficiency of the burn and power losses over the course of a regular ICE engine--this is the biggest efficiency loss. There are a tonne of steps in this process, it's energetically expensive, and therefore, produces more GHG by-products. 

Don't be fooled. H2, if it ever becomes viable, will be another tool of the big oil majors. They control the multi-trillion dollar extraction and processing infrastructure already. They will use it any possible way to squeeze every possible shekel out of it until it breathes its last breath, and they don't care if they turn the entire planet into the Sahara Desert in the process.   

Until we have home electrolysis units producing fuel safely from our homes, or otherwise cut Big Energy interests out of the equation, H2 will remain a gimmick.",,

The conclusion was that yes wearing the real 95s can be hard to breathe in and may reduce oxygen. No mention of it not protecting the user of the mask. I’m not discrediting you just on that haha just a commment since you sent many links and I just don’t have much time. I appreciate you reaching out back and hopefully I’ll have more time later to read. 

Idk mate I have severe asthma, I smoked for almost a decade, to the point of like I really had to stop because I straight up couldn’t smoke anymore (hey this jobs stressful lmfao)
I can still wear two masks and a face shield without extreme distress. Now after 8 hours plus straight up extreme stress yeah when I take off my mask I notice that I felt a little deprived but honestly once you’re used to it it’s nothing and again I do not have health/lungs on my side. But again this isn’t about the efficacy of protection (just off the third link from punned) I’m actually one of those people trying to save sci hub btw you should check out the project if you’re interested and can seed from a private seedbox or can vpn and don’t give a fuck about love letters. 77tb to backup and preserve so we can keep reading these articles!! I’m fairly young for my lung issues which apparently has been going on my whole life and I just recently discovered sorry I’m kinda rambling. Just in a hurry. Much love dude.

You're paying a premium to have the right, but not obligation, to buy 100 shares at the strike price. 


Most option traders trade the premium, with no intention of exercising (except some cases). The premium has a lot of factors that impact the price you pay. 


Example: AMC had low volatility two weeks ago ($12 - $14) with little movement. So calls two weeks ago were a lot cheaper than they are now, due to the volatility of the stock rapidly increasing. Volatility is a good thing for option traders, pushing the price of the premium higher. 


The premium you pay gives you the ""option"" to buy 100 shares at the strike price. But you are not obligated to do so. (Meaning you can just sell the option instead of exercising for the shares) 


So in this case, OP likely bought a call dated a month out, for at the time would of been a high strike price. ($20c when the share price was only $12-14) 


High strikes are cheaper, because they are less likely to happen prior to experation. OP was lucky, and AMC mooned. IV, influx of buyers,",,

Then this last Tuesday during a conference the director of research and development has said in a few days they will release the data.  I don't want to say they're going to release the data in a couple days but there's a good chance they're going to do it on Tuesday but I don't want to let people down so I'm going to say one week to two weeks Max. I think it will be Tuesday morning because they have a healthcare conference with Jeffrey's an investor and analyst covering our stock. Either way should be out any day so I give it two weeks Max but don't expect it to take that long really.

Turn to the 1 minute mark in the link to the video below and listen to the CEOs response at the 1:15 minite mark. That's where he mentions a couple weeks and this was a couple weeks ago.

So today I noticed LEDS was up around 54%, and is up 290% this month on no news. 

I checked yahoo finance and apparently the ""short % of float"" is 120.07% as of May 14th. 

What's going on here? Is there people trying to squeeze the short sellers in this stock? Something else going on?

Also, is there anywhere I can check what current short percents are on a stock?

That's a great question I'm actually glad you asked that the reason why I held is because a pre-revenue biotech can sometimes be unpredictable and trying to time the weather can hurt you sometimes in the long run I'm trying to trade it a lot. I got 4,000% gains by just holding and not trading. Sure I could have cashed out at 330 but I know the real potential of this as do many other longs who bought in in the $4 range. and I didn't want to pay any taxes just yet I want to let that tax money stay in there and keep building off the shares I have. Two other things one news was unknown at the time one catalyst we're going to drop so the easiest thing was to do is hold and not try to time all the catalysts. Cuz as you know I'm biotech they don't give you sometimes it heads up when the news drops the CEO stand is a huge fan of doing back-to-back news and sticking it to the shorts. But because the biotech was pre-revenue at the time that price was volatile now that it's getting to be approved it should stabilize a lot more at a higher price.  I also didn't expect for there to be a giant market crash in February lol. But I got no qualms with it I'm sitting pretty on 4k% gains just hanging out 😂. 

Feel free and go on my stock twits you can see in my history (SN is Johnnyknowsbest) I've been in since the beginning. A lot of people sold when it hit $12 a lot of people sold when it hit $20 a lot of people sold when I hit 40 a lot of people sold when I hit 80 a lot of people sold when I hit 100. That's the reason why I don't like trading it because it seems like a good time to sell but knowing the fundamentals this is going up and up. It's the most undervalued covid play right now with the smallest float. They were bankrupt a year ago and are now set to receive billions in profits, kind of like gme they were able to restructure during the pandemic and actually turn it. But not turning around in a minor way we're talking about turning around a company it's about to be out of funds to a company that's going to be a major pharma player. This doesn't happen very often in the stock market but the pandemic made it possible and now with 6 to 10 billion in revenue next year of 50 to 80 billion dollar market cap is not only plausible it's expected in line with it's competition",,

Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategy growth target for the company.  However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens.  In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale.  If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over.  WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.

A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:

\- Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions, thereby lowering its cost  
  
\- All the goods sold in the front end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products that Walmart sells in its department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.  
  
Based on the above 2 points, Walmart improves both its own existing margins and at the same time improves those of the Rite Aid revenue.  
  
The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.  
  
If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $5 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels.   So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payment on the investment.",,

I like how their vehicles look and this seemed interesting to me.

Then I thought about it and thought it was a little weird that a company would advertise to invest in it to the public? Then I thought I remembered someone  told me that the general public cannot invest in a pre IPO stock because they aren't considered a sophisticated investor. Then I thought this might be some type of scam.

I've been thinking about playing it with Space stocks like MAXR, LMT, SPCE, BA and others. I've been watching MAXR since it shat the bed after earnings and it has been up every day since... I wonder if it is in preparation for the release?

Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity.

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on “Rhodium” that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself “Am I really that retarded?” Then, he realized “No, it must be Oklahoma that’s retarded!”

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could’ve been anyone’s guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone’s guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we’ll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let’s all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/) 

And for a while, things were kind ok for our young Autist. [He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees “a year” to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he’s ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn’t enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don’t know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he’s going to crash up there.

5947,,2021-05-28 03:12:37,t3_nmofz4,,wallstreetbets,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmofz4,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)"

What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it’s debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the “high affinity core users” would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You’ll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They’re in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they’ve struggled). They’re sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn’t be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it’s worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that’s working. You can’t sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I’m long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2…. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-€31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept. 
Also with revenue now coming in Nasa who are conducting micro gravity analysis.
Also international training for military pilots and astronauts.
Commercial flights look imminent.
Space ports planned for around the globe and intercontinental travel looming.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

5970,,2021-05-28 09:17:32,t3_nmtt43,,wallstreetbets,"Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

5975,,2021-05-28 10:41:01,t3_nmuzzi,,wallstreetbets,"Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Modernas if not more. Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects) 

Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

Imagine if the spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize one piece to understand the whole picture it and helps modify your DNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates it can still recognize the virus. In contrast to using one portion of the picture as it mutates it's easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine, that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. Not only that but they have had the least amount of side effects of any covid vaccine deeming it the safest covid vaccine.... 

And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein (whole picture) and the safety profile. Also worth a mention is that you could store it in a regular refrigerator, and let it sit out in room temperature while you're vaccinating people instead of a special ultra low temp freeze needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers, this is a majority of the world. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. They will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025 for possibly double the price of current covid vaccine.

 They are pretty much de-risked at this point. Yes you could buy other  biotechs that can go up 20x but are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up) that has all successful trials done so far, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment to where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place there are no more glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. Yesterday at market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract in there ( in the link below in another message). It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 

I own a lot of $250 July calls along with about 1k shares. I'm all in baby. LFG I expect to turn 200k into over a million in a year's time via shares and options

Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation which will confirm all of this ...

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to –4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it’s a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}

I've been lurking on wsb for some time now (as a guest) and I know there has been a huge price spike earlier this year on the stock (which then made it $1B mkt cap) but I honestly don't get it why PETS is being forgotten ever since.

I've been looking in to the fundamentals of the company and the business is looking extremely good, I don't see the reasoning behind the shortselling (30% of float are short) of this company.

1) PETS has a profitable business (which is well known in the US) that generates plenty of FCF that covers the generous dividend (which is $1.20 / 4.13%).  
2) PETS does not have any debt on its balance sheet.  
3) PETS has a Return on Equity/Return on invested capital of 22.5% (which is quite good)  
4) For some reason, 30% of PETS shares are being sold short. The only reason I can think of is the fact that at some point their business can be copied by Amazon or some other company but I honestly don't see that happen any time soon.  


I've also checked reviews on the app of the company and their service in general. It seems that PETS scores really well on them.   


All in all I'm really bullish on the stock, I don't see the reasoning behind the shortselling and if at some point the shorts get squeezed out, this stock has the potential to get the valuation it should get.

&#x200B;

I'm wondering what you guys think about it.

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we’ll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals  especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative 

 Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 

Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms.

This why stackers of all levels, whether big or small should feel proud of every gram or ounce of they own.

They are draining the LBMA & CrimeX. In a highly leveraged market “200 paper to 1 physical” by some accounts and “50 paper to 1 physical” by some other accounts;

Us Mint nowadays have a record high demand not seen in their history .

So what's next :

Aren't they required by constitution to make silver coins in a certain quantity?

So which price ?

Opportunity of buying silver cheap and timely is really about to end.

THIS IS MEGA. It is even more evidence that the big tidal wave is turning in favour for Silver . Do not miss this train starting out, still very much at the ground floor.

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate. We must get the word out and pressure CLNE corporate to begin marketting campaigns to get the word out. I think it's about time.",nn0whs,Cramer on CLNE

Essentially, purchasing a call option, gives you the ""option"" to buy 100 shares at the strike. But you don't have to. You can just sell the option. 


A put is the opposite. Purchasing a put options gives you the right to SELL 100 shares at the strike. But you don't have to. You can just sell the option instead.

6519,gzs351l,2021-05-28 17:10:04,t1_gzs351l,t1_gzs1lg7,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been in this stock since it was $5.5 in early February. I’ve watched it go from $5.5 to $14, back to $6, and back again to $14 multiple times. Me and my buddy hold our 2500+ shares in my brokerage. 

I’m 19, I’m not rich, I’m not an experienced investor, I don’t claim to know everything. My account value was $96000CAD earlier today, now it’s around $68k. It’s a lot of money for me, but I truly do not care. I’ve spent countless hours everyday for the past four months learning everything I could about the stock and trading in general. I have 100% conviction in the stock and my reason for investing in it hasn’t changed. They can take me down to $5 again and I’ll simply continue to wait for the pieces to fall into place.

That’s the power that research and conviction has when holding a stock. I’m grateful everyday that I’m not sitting here panicking looking at the chart, unaware of why it’s going up or why it’s going down. And so I hope that anyone reading my comment can truly understand the importance of distancing yourself from your emotions, and that as long as the reason why you invested in the stock hasn’t changed, there’s no reason to make any impulsive decisions.",,

That's because someone ""wrote"" these contracts. Obligating the ""writer"" to commit to buying 100 shares or selling 100 shares at whatever strike price they chose. 


So someone out there, ""wrote"" a call contract our OP purchased.... (allowing the call ""writer"" to collect the premium) but they are now obligated to sell 100 shares to OP at $20. Even though, market value is now well above $20. 


This is where your profit comes in. OP now has an option to exercise the 100 shares or just sell the option. 


Obligating the call ""writer"" to sell the 100 shares to OP at $20. Even though market value may be $30. 


Resulting in: (current price $30) - (strike price $20) = $10 profit per share × 100 shares = 1k profit. 


Or you can just sell the option and let some other person exercise. Should equal the same amount whether you exercise or just sell the premium.",,

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the last price of **100.92** which gives us a total value of:

Am since a year on the stock market and have paid in the time my starter money, 1000 euros miserably as apprenticeship money. Am therefore broke. Who does not know it, back and forth makes pockets Empty, on shares where already exceeded their ATH have entered and then the course slipped into the ground, made a lot of minus because of it and bye the dip.... Has also brought nothing.

Now I stand here, do not know what to do.

Will then buy amc shares and of course prove this with nem screenshot.



I just try times, would be happy about any donation.

Thanks a lot for that.

FOMO comes in a tidal wave then leaves slowly.

Bag holders typically hold for a long time till they become demoralized and then eventually sell to just hold forever because why bother taking massive losses. When things don't go in their favor there are a lot of day traders that dump everything first before the major fall thus causing the drop.

If you use AMC and GME as the basis for investing then you will lose everywhere but AMC and GME. Really we had a short squeeze on AMC already and there were not too many shorts. If people didn't get margin called at $35 then they are probably not going to leave or doubled down. Most of the low price shorts are most likely out or have enough reserves to weather this. 

Of course this is just my opinion and these meme stocks are completely illogical at times. Personally I like taking half profits then seeing if it rises more. If it doesn't then I still come out ahead.",,

8226,gzs5yma,2021-05-28 17:30:33,t1_gzs5yma,t3_nmuzzi,wallstreetbets,"Here's my summary of Novavax's current status:

CONS:  
\- Novavax PR/IR do not communicate well with their respective communities  
\- Novavax' management has unusually low-energy in interviews  
\- US PREVENT-19 trial results converted from ""# of events"" to ""time based"" due to 60% dropouts (the # of dropouts was slowed by initiating crossover)  
\- Other EUAs also deferred to Q3 (""as early in quarter as possible"")  
\- 150M/mo goal moved from Q3 to Q4 due to shortage of raw materials  
\- No mention of when NanoFlu goes into arms  
\- No mention of why Texas production hasn't started  
\- Flu/Covid combo vaccine not broadly in arms until after 2022  
  
  
PROS:  
0) nothing in the above materially changes a successful outcome, except dates -- by a little, not much  
1) Highest efficacy against original Covid-19 strain (\~96%)  
   \- Pfizer: 95%  
   \- Moderna: 94%  
   \- J&J: 72%  
   \- AstraZeneca: 62%  
   \- CanSino: 65%  
   \- Sinopharm: 79%  
   \- Sinovac: 50%  
   \- Sputnik: 91% (questionable)  
2) Highest efficacy against South Africa variant (\~60%)  
   \- Novavax: 60%  
   \- J&J: 57%  
   \- AstraZeneca: 10%  
   \- others: horrible  
3) Excellent efficacy against UK variant (86%)  
   \- Novavax’s technology shows excellent cross-protection against drifted strains and mutations  
   \- this aspect of Novavax's technology was recently proven /w its Flu vaccine ...handily beating the market leader: Fluzone  
   \- We'll learn MUCH more about this once PREVENT-19 results are published  
4) Highest single-dose efficacy (83.4%)  
\- better than JNJ  
5) Highest levels of Antibodies: 600% higher than the next-best vaccine!  
\- the Novavax vaccine probably will last for about 5 months longer than the next best vaccine  
6) To the best of my knowledge, NVX-Cov2373 is the only vaccine shown to produce ""sterilizing immunity""  
\- what's that? it prevents an innuculated person from spreading the virus  
	\- a clear (and huge) advantage  
7) The only major Covid vaccine that can EASILY be made into a multivalent vaccine that contains multiple variants in a single dose  
\- 60-80% less antigen (5μg) than RNA vaccines  
	\- NanoFlu already has 4 strains of the flu in its dose   
	\- when asked how many strains he could get into a single jab, Stan said ""lots"" and ""unlimited""  
	\- This may prove to be the most important factor for determining which vaccine is best  
	\- This is the future; Others can't do this  
8) Novavax has the highest manufacturing capacity ...slated to be about  
= 700M doses in 2021 (w/o SK, SII. Pessemistic view)  
\- 2B run-rate by end of 2021 (w/o SK, SII)  
	\- 3+B run-rate /w SK, SII by early 2022  
9) Novavax has ""lowest cost per dose"" (Bill Gates)  
10) Novavax has simplicity of manufacturing  
\- ""the composition of the Novavax makes it arguably the simplest yet to manufacture""  (Al Edwards)  
11) Novavax has the most geographically-diversified production  
\- US, EU, UK, Japan, South Korea, India, and Canada  
12) Novavax has the highest quality group of partners  
\- Not just first place, Novavax ""has taken partnerships to a whole other level""  
13) Beats all other manufacturers /w easiest distribution and storage requirements  
   \- 36°F to 46°F ...normal refrigeration  
   \- stores for up to 6 months  
14) Best tolerability (% issues)  
   \- Novavax: 40%  
   \- Pfizer: 91%  
   \- Moderna: 90%  
   \- others: worse than Novavax  
15) Longest durability of protection  
16) Developed w/o the use of fetal cell lines (this will become an issue once there is ""choice"" of vaccines)  
17) Novavax is very undervalued with tremendous upside, making it a strong buy  
18) Novavax continues to be largely off the radar for the general public  
19) The mainstream media (including most of the financial media) and the market have not yet started to pay attention  
20) Analyst Josh Schimmer (Evercore ISI), believes Novavax is the “vaccine to beat”  
21) Analysts at B. Riley (Mayank Mamtani) and JP Morgan said Novavax is ""best-in-class""  
22) “strong potency and unique tolerability”  
23) an extremely large addressable market  
24) a market cap of only \~$13B (tiny compared to all other pharma cos)  
25) Biotech and pharma companies are normally valued at a price-to-sales multiple of 6-7x  
26) suffice it to say that a EOY price target of $422 is being fairly conservative  
27) if the company shows signs that it will achieve its goal of a 2 billion annual capacity run-rate by mid/end 2021, the price target would rapidly jump higher  
28) The target should also go higher as:  
\- its vaccine receives approvals in various major countries  
\- it is rolled out and becomes a far larger part of the public's consciousness  
\- the company should have significant pricing power by having the best vaccine  
29) If it's production capacity reaches 3 billion, the rise in the share price skyrocket  
30) This does not count revenues of its flu, maleria, or RSV vaccines  
\- Best in class Maleria vaccine  
\- The market for RSV vaccines is over $5 billion, and it's the only RSV vaccine on the market!!  
31) the NOVX downside a month ago was about 4 times higher than now. There is still a very large amount of upside.  
32) Best risk/reward profile from an investment standpoint  
33) UK EU CA NZ AU US MX IN UA ID KR PH CH JP   
  
These and its many other advantages  
\- make it the top vaccine  
\- allow Novavax to charge a premium  
\- will give Novavax the largest share of the long-term market (as much as 45% of world market)  
  
Novavax clearly gets the title of ""best Covid vaccine stock"" !!!!!!!!!!  
$750 likely w/i 1 year!!",,

This group is called wall street BETS. Its a casino. When you buy you bet that a short squeeze will happen. AMC is very hyped so the recent gains are probably not related to shorts. They are more likely the result of regular trading of a hyped stock.   


When the short squeeze effect starts the stock should multiply drastically in value, way beyond these rather ""normal"" fluctuations. When this happens its all a matter of group psychology, the longer everyone holds, the larger the gains. But if you as an individual miss the peak by a lot, then you risk losing everything. The peak will happen when the majority starts selling.

Even then, H2 fuel replacements will just be a transition away from the consumer ICE marketplace. 

Given the same price, would you rather have a vehicle that burns fuel and needs oil changes or one that doesn't do either, which do you want? I know which one sounds more appealing to the average person.

The advent of EVs throws the efficiency question out the window for ICE vehicles. They simply can't compete with upwards of 70% efficiencies from EVs, plus the low maintenance, no oil changes, extension of battery pack life, etc. 

These other fuels do have a place in the transportation needs of the future--drones, aircraft, industrial machinery, all will continue to use liquid fuels for combustion, but the retail ICE market will be displaced by batteries and nothing will stop that now.",,

Bottom line is, retail is selling to retail who are FOMOing like crazy. The shorts have nothing to do with all this crap. Everyone tells each other to hold and that the floor is $500k and that they aren't selling, because they are hoping to sell before them.

Imagine you’re me. Relatively tall, spent years being very athletic, used to be able to run a five minute mile, had sub 18 minute 5k times in high school, used to play soccer as a middie. Then you stopped, because there were other, more interesting things. Things with more laughter. Great, let’s do those things. And you don’t realize it, but gradually, you’re eating the same amount and not working out at all. You go from 160 pounds to 180, then 200, but it doesn’t really look like you weigh much more, right you’ve still been getting a little taller, it’s only natural, and then you hit 210, 230, 240, but you’re fine, you’re still in a pretty good shape, honestly, because you’re tall. Somewhere in the middle of this is a year of constant athleticism and acrobatics and you get down to a *very fit* 210. Great, you’re doing good, you don’t look your best, but whatever. You work in fine dining after this, you’re walking 10-20k steps a day, boom, you’re still fine.

*Then the pandemic hits. You move into your parents’ basement. You eat free food. Develop a chic fil a addiction, stop cooking for yourself, watch movies and the stock market all day for six months.* 250lbs, you now have a beer belly, your clothes don’t fit, you’re out of it.

You move out. You get an apartment outside of Boston. You get bored, and you realize: I have to start working out again. I don’t have a fucking choice, I’m miserable, my body is begging me to move. Fine. You slowly build your way up over a month, boom, you’re getting there, it’s hell, you take breaks in between but honestly nothing is *too hard*

Then today happens. Let’s talk about the SOD.

> 6 Min, EMOM, Odds: 30 seconds each side side plank, Evens: Foam Rollers.

No problem, I’ve got this. Surely this doesn’t mean there’s going to be an intense WOD... Nice, easy day, right? Murph is coming up! Let’s not kill them!

> 50 Burpees

> 500 Meter Row

> 40 Power Cleans

> 400 Meter Run

> 30 Weighted Forward Lunges

> 500 Meter Row

> 20 Thrusters

> 400 Meter Run

> 10 Chest To Bars (But obviously I did fucking ring rows)

Happily the slowest one there, feel exhausted, but also super proud. Wasn’t a light workout. 28:43. Gonna find a way to swim this weekend as my workout, take some walks, but I’m gonna be there on Monday for the Murph. My favorite coach wants me to bring him some of my habenero honey whiskey so I have an obligation.",,

The fuel cell is your battery.  But also, the H2 you get can be used as gas for stoves and fireplaces and what not.  

I love my ICE car.  I'd love to run it on H2.  Personally I dont trust BEVs and every Li-ion battery I've had didnt last after a few years (I know car batteries are more robust).  Infact I had a cell phone battery nearly blow up, the casing was bulged out like a balloon.  If I could I'd remove all the computer dependency out of the car I'd do it too.

People think about H2 in small passenger vehicles all wrong.  Forget efficiency for a moment.  Once we get away from gas reforming and H2 is made off peak hours from the grid.  It'll be freely sourced from water or waste.  Solar, wind, hydro, nuclear will make the H2 free too.  It'll be abundant and clean the air by using it.  They have materials in development that can store H2 4x as compact as traditional tanks and contain 5x the fuel.  Couple that with ultra capacitors or batteries that dont rely on rare earth metals or toxic lithium and the benefits out way any efficiency arguments to me.",,

Personally I dont trust BEVs and every Li-ion battery I've had didnt last after a few years (I know car batteries are more robust). Infact I had a cell phone battery nearly blow up, the casing was bulged out like a balloon. If I could I'd remove all the computer dependency out of the car I'd do it too.

This is all understandable as an emotional response to the changing market, but ultimately this approach ignores the raw reality that BEVs are vastly more efficient and lower cost of maintenance than anything else. By a longshot.

There's no motivation to put a tonne of money into H2--especially into large-scale production of consumer level electrolysis--because BEVs already solve every problem with *higher* efficiency. People and companies have better things to spend their money on than a problem that's already solved. They'd end up spending a fortune for a final product that's less than half the efficiency with current BEV tech.

Who's taking that deal? Someone with a large marketing budget.",,
