In main I was curious about debt ratios.  AutoNation's growth numbers are less impressive than Lithia Motors', but they do have more long-term and better Free Cash Flow numbers.  

What I'm coming to find is that automotive retailers tend to carry a lot of debt, but interestingly enough some of that high debt is due to Floor Planning Debt.  This is a form of revolving short-term debt by which they acquire vehicle inventories.  The loans are paid as the inventory is sold, and the credit is ""recycled"" for new inventory.  

Based on the 2020 numbers, Lithia Motors' short term assets do exceed the short term liabilities.  Compared to the long term liabilities, the short term assets are greater.  They will pay down roughly $200m of the long-term liabilities in 2021, then $500m in 2022-23.

careless deregulation

debasing to special interests

a large serving of incompetence

bad-faith legislators not doing their job right

leaning on the war machine

screwing up the gov's ability to perform by messing up the budget's priorities - for instance, slashing pandemic response departments and projects and then being astonished when a pandemic hits us all like a tsunami.

It's not a coincidence that major catastrophes happen to the likes of Bush and Trump, at the same time that business regulation has been destabilized beyond breaking, and fed-level economy stabilization tools have been abused and left empty. 

Just bad decision making, on top of amateurish policy ideas, on top of legislation shifted from logic to serve special interests, on top a strained economy favoring their pet money-making grifts. The moment life throws us a curve ball the economy falls like a house of cards, and we are all left staring at each other surprised that weak policy ideas coupled with incompetence and a strong serving of grift could result in shaky conditions.

Many of these things just don't happen to Democrats. [Bush had the 9/11 plan on his desk](https://www.politico.eu/article/attacks-will-be-spectacular-cia-war-on-terror-bush-bin-laden/) for a while before it actually happen, literally a dossier saying that intelligence agencies believed terrorists were planning to fly planes into buildings. 

[Obama beat Ebola](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-usa/u-s-military-ends-ebola-mission-in-liberia-idUSKBN0LU2HR20150226) and was left scared shitless of the danger of a pandemic, so he left a very detailed pandemic response plan. Not only personnel in places to act as national and international coordinators, but a plan for various gov departments, and [forced the incoming Trump workers to do a pandemic exercise](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/488069-obama-officials-walked-trump-aides-through-global-pandemic-exercise-in-2017). Also left plans for massive PPE factories, etc. The Trump admin dismantled or defunded most of that, including losing many of his own workers that took the mandatory pandemic exercise from Obama. [The N95 mask factory cancelled](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/federal-government-spent-millions-to-ramp-up-mask-readiness-but-that-isnt-helping-now/2020/04/03/d62dda5c-74fa-11ea-a9bd-9f8b593300d0_story.html), the medical supplies warehouses left under-managed, [slashed our international CDC offices](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv/exclusive-u-s-slashed-cdc-staff-inside-china-prior-to-coronavirus-outbreak-idUSKBN21C3N5) for early warning and international coordination, etc. Even went as far as [defunding the WHO](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/14/trump-world-health-organization-funding-186786), the international coordination and relief agency, in the middle of the pandemic. These are just not things that would happen under a Democrat administration.

So in a way it sounds too simple. Poorly thought out deregulation, poorly thought out budget reallocation, poorly thought out pulling out of gov expenses that were meant to strengthen us. Combine that with gov corruption of the special interests kind, and a healthy dose of incompetence in leadership with so many positions awarded by political/personal/financial interest instead of merit, and it seems impossible to imagine that they wouldn't crash something. Give them long enough and they'll crash most anything. Foreign enemies getting a free pass, economy left without safety nets, markets and systems destabilized, and nobody competent enough to grab the reigns when things start to fall apart.

That's 12 years of Bush and Trump in a nutshell.

So in short, **how does this apply to the stock market?** 

Democrats tend to create stability. It may not always be growth, but it will move predictably.

Republicans administrations produce roller coaster type of markets. Sharp growth thanks to happy-go-lucky policy, senseless deregulation and abusing the market pumping tools; then a sharp crash at the first sign of a strong wind.

In a way, Republican administrations can be the best for major wealth growth, if you can time the market roller coaster.",,

The previous administration coasted on the improving economy and decided the best possible to do was give tax cuts benefiting huge companies when they didn't really need that cut.

82,gzq20ob,2021-05-28 04:37:39,t1_gzq20ob,t3_nmmz3r,stocks,"Hedge funds shorted the stock thinking it was going to succumb to the covid outbreak and bet it was going to go bankrupt, just like they did with companies like Toys R Us. Then a few smart folks out there noticed and spread the numbers all across media outlets. This led to a glorious community of supporters of the company that dug deeper into the technicals of what was going on and found out that some hedge funds were pumping synthetic shares (naked shorts; borrowment of a shares that get sold multiple times) into market place trying to drive the price down even further. The community rallied, bought shares and options contracts for the last 5 months and have so far made it possible for AMC to keep afloat through 2022. Their largest shareholder slowly eased out of their holdings and the community bought them all up.

To this day, the shorts have not covered their shorts (or naked shorts). In fact, they continue to short the stock. Since the stock holders own around 80% of the available common stock and likely most if not all of the synthetics, the owners are waiting for the hedge funds to cover their shorts and to buy back the synthetic shares. Multiple. Times. 

AMC is also going to do a share recall at the beginning of June to see who owns what and how many shares are actually in circulation. There should only be 493 Million. Those hedge funds who have not covered their positions are heavily leveraged and under water. It is anticipated that their financiers are going to demand they have the money in cash to balance their books. This is called a margin call. The community is in the strong belief that they cannot do this. If they cannot, their positions will be forced to liquidate, thus bankrupting the hedge fund.

Hedge funds have been doing shenanigans like this since the 1920's, resulting in one of the worse economic unravelings in the world. The internal governing body, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been writing and passing new laws and votes to curtail this behavior after the GameStop price skyrocketed. 

What is going on right now with AMC is a combination of big money manipulating the market and the retail investor going head to head. Sentiment is very high, a new factor to consider that cannot be charted. 

Hope this sheds some light 💡😉",,

Just one of dozens of examples, when we fill out a Safety report in the app it wont show up to someone else using the web version for sometimes hours. Same going the other way this leads to constant sync conflicts. The syncing itself for a single form also takes around 1-3 minutes, and in that time I literally have to sit there and wait. Lightning UI is also missing a load of features that classic has and lots of us rely on those exact features to do our job effectively, so it also causes people to be using different versions.

Literally every single person I know who has dealt with Salesforce physical cringes when someone brings it up, its a literally trigger for people. I wish I was exaggerating.",,

The benefit of it now is many dealers have a markup on everything due to the parts supply chain issues, and they have no incentive to deal too much.

I might have a minor thing or two wrong in my vagueness.

Markets have largely switched over to registered shares of stock that have made them easier to transfer and track ownership. When you go to Xetra you're trading either shares of the company (cross-listed) or you're trading an EDR of the foreign stock. In Apple's case, I'm not sure which it is, but I haven't seen an EDR mentioned. More on EDR later.

In both cases there are institutional investment firms and banks between the markets. They have the unique ability to buy shares in large blocks in one exchange and sell elsewhere. If demand weakens in one market, even a small bit, an institutional firm will buy up shares in the weaker market and sell in the market with stronger demand and even the price between the two markets. They earn a small amount on the price difference, but also take care of the currency conversion. There are competing institutional investment firms doing this, so the margins between the different markets is typically very narrow.

When you see the price on Xetra, you're only seeing the price as if it affected in that exchange. If the institutional firm sees a small difference in demand, they will react (and take a slither of a cut of the difference), and keep things priced nearly the same. The thing to watch out for is sometimes there could be small delays in these actions. If there is a sudden price change in the US market and not in the European market, it might take a few minutes for these institutional forms react and complete trades.  This is also some of the after-market trading you see, so you don't fully know how the other foreign market will react when they open back up, that can lead to some prices shifts when that happens. Apple is traded in many markets across the world in some form.

Of course, USD-EUR currency conversion matters in the middle of this.

&#x200B;

The other thing I mentioned was an EDR, European Depository Receipt. The American version, ADR, American Depository Receipt, has been around in some form since the 1920's.

In this case the stock is actually held by an institutional investing bank on behalf of anyone buying it in an exchange. The depository receipt is a security that represents an actual stock security held by an investment bank. It trades the same as stock and holds the same value.  The big benefit is you would buy, sell, and treat it the same as a domestic asset. If there are any taxes, conversions, or cross-border issues holding the security that is handled more efficiently by the institutional investment bank holding the actual stock security.

You still get the ownership held on your behalf, dividend, and in many cases voting rights.

Of course, any conversion costs or taxes the bank has holding of trading that security with another country will impact the cost of that EDR in your exchange. So if two nations have weird laws impacting the institutional trade of these stocks cross-borders, it becomes a cost barrier to them keeping the pricing precisely even across exchanges. That small difference happens from the institutional investor needing to make a certain value on the cross-border trades to handle those costs, when they exist.

Americans and Europeans, typically play well together.

On my side of the pond, I own shares in ABB. It is actually an ADR traded on the NYSE, so the actual share is held by an investment bank, but there is a depository receipt I hold in my name that gives me the rights to one of the shares they hold.

&#x200B;

China plays unique. They are fearful of any sort of foreign control and regulated heavily.  They have slowly been opening up, but all of these growing companies want access to capitol. 

Some companies have set up off-shore companies that invest into the Chinese company through a VIE, variable interest entity that makes a lump sum purchase into the Chinese stocks where there is no voting rights to the shareholder.

China has been allowing direct foreign ownership of lower-class shares that do not have voting rights in a few select exchanges. Hong Kong has long been a financial market that acts as a intermediary trading between China and the rest of the world. They are allowed to trade one kind of these shares that is a bit easier to trade.

So I own some BABA, Alibaba. It is an ADR that is actually buying a share in Alibaba's off-shore company in the Cayman Island's that makes a direct investment into BABA through a VIE. I can't actually directly buy stock in Alibaba, just a promise they will give me my cut and I can sell my stake through the off-shore holding company.

If I set up an account in Hong Kong or Shanghai, I can trade in those exchanges directly, but only certain lower class shares that give me no voting rights as a foreigner

I don't buy more than 5% China. They need to open up more and give shareholders voting rights and play well with the rest of the world.",,

For everyone else, this will take a couple thousand off of MSRP, which is different than invoice price. Invoice price is dealer cost.


As someone who sold cars for Ford,  I can assure you,  the X Plan is nowhere close to ""dealer cost"".  
The X plan is the lowest rung of discounts and is typically reserved for friends and family members of a Ford Employee.  I.e. i know a guy that works at Ford, lemme get a discount plz. 

A-plan (current Ford factory employees), D plan (current Ford dealership employees) and z plan (retired Ford factory employees) are significantly cheaper than x plan.  


When you use one of the employee plans,  you have no negotiating power(i.e. ""no haggle""). 
Its true,  Each invoice has the X/D/A price printed on it,  but *This is not the price they paid for the car*.    
They'll gladly show you this invoice and show you how much you're saving vs the ""sticker price"", but nobody has ever paid sticker price for a car.  The ""thousands off MSRP"" is a gimmick, nothing more.  

Even when they show you the invoice, they're probably lying.  Its the ole switcharoo, they'll get a similar car thats more expensive and show you the ""invoice"" and the ""x plan discount"" vs the MSRP.   You can print this for any car on the lot, I've personally used it to show someone ""what a great deal they're getting"". 

Bottom line,  If you think the dealership is making $0 off of you, you're just the kind of fool they want to sell a car to.

The dealer has a set amount they take off the top of every vehicle they sell.  This number varies from dealership to dealership, but its usually between $500-$1000.  As a sales person, they dont pay you commission on this money.  My dealership called it a reserve, as in, i reserve $750 for myself, fuck you very much.  
As a sales person, my commission was 25% on profit AFTER the reserve, with a minimum commission of $100/unit (aka minis).  The only car we were making minis off of was the focus (we called them the fuck-us, bc we made a mini on them).  A ""pounder"" was a car we made $1,000 off of, as in this idiot bought the car at first pencil (the first bullshit price to start the negotiation) and i made a 4 pounder ($4,000).  This happened once in my car sales career (which only happened once to me). For what it's worth  I made a 2 pounder off of one of the 2 X Plan deals I sold. 

Even if they don't get you on the price (they will), they can still make money off of the back end.  
The  difference  between the interest rate you actually qualify for and the interest you pay is all dealer profit.  Most dealerships almost always get AT LEAST 2%. I fucking worked there and they still tried to pull this shit on me (I got it down to 1%). 
 Most car salesmen don't even get to see the rate (its the sales manager and finance guys job to fuck you on your interest rate).  
X plan cars don't qualify for factory incentivized interest rates (i.e. ford truck month's 0% for 60 months or 2,500 ""cashback""), so you'll pay market rate (plus at least 2%). 

Car salesmen and dealers have a knack for making customers *FEEL* like they got a great deal, thats how they make themselves seem like the good guy. I can assure you, the house always wins.",,

AMC Entertainment stock rocketed more than 50% higher on Thursday before paring gains a bit. But this time around, fellow meme stock GameStop wasn’t along for the ride.  
AMC shares (ticker: AMC) closed up 36% to $26.52, its highest close since May 12, 2017, according to Dow Jones Market Data. GameStop stock (GME) was up 4.9%, to $254.13. The performance gap likely isn’t due to differing views about the companies’ business prospects, but rather supply-and-demand quirks that are exaggerated by short interest, social-media excitement, and momentum-based trading activity.  
Shares of GameStop and AMC—both hugely popular among retail investors on Reddit and highly shorted by some Wall Street funds—have seen a resurgence together in recent weeks. Options activity has also picked up for both, according to Susquehanna analyst Christopher Jacobson.

I'm really interested in the clean energy space. These are the two ETFs I'm looking at:
$PBW: Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF
&INRG: iShares Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF

The top 10 of both their holdings are completely different, but they are both aimed at the same sector. Is there any logic to invest equal money in both of them or is it better to just put all of that fund into one of them?

I guess ultimately if I knew which one would give better yield I would just pick that but as that's not possible is it safer to go for more coverage? 

Any guidance would be really appreciated. Thanks.",nmtwck,Is it worth investing in two ETFs aimed at the same sector?

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)

I just went through this. Log on to your account and search for ""withdraw excess contribution."" With TDA, there is a form to print out, sign, then upload to message center. With Fidelity it's an online form. On the form there will be an option to tick to let the broker calculate the gains for you. Also there will be an option for the broker to sell shares of your choosing in case you don't have cash in the account.

The game is still not in the PlayStation store more than half a year after release. And from looking closer at the game it seems 2 things are obvious to me:     
1) they have unmaintainable bug-riddled codebase that they will struggle to build anything upon     
2) they have spent so many years on Cyberpunk, but the game is mostly a re-skin of the Witcher 3 game

Yes, they hit it big with the sales on the release, but this was done at a huge cost to their reputation and goodwill with their clients, which translates to lower future engagement and revenue. If they had any plans to get filthy rich with the Cyberpunk Online release (copying Rockstar's GTA V Online success) they really shoot themselves in the foot with this botched release.",,

1. You have a job that can confidently pay for your home.
2. You aren't trading stock with debt
3. Option calls or puts are not being utilized
4. You are interested in diversifying assets to combat risk
5. Context will only consider selling stocks to pay for the down payment.

Try to seperate your spec stocks from your reliable stocks. If you are losing pretty heavily on spec stocks, those should be the first to go. 

Your winner stocks, you should sell with your own discretion, but the question you should ask is ""Is the stock up because there is a rally or because it is a reliable stock?"" If you feel the stock is up because of a rally then sell, if not keep.

Now if you feel like you are holding onto a good stock, but it is losing, then you have a few choices. You can sell the stock that may potentialy appreciate in value or you can sell the stock that is already appreciated. I would recommend selling the losing stock, in an effort to mitigate risk, however if you are risk tolerant then you can choose to sell your winners instead. (or a combination of the two)

I personally think it's a decent time to get into stock, however I am not omnipotent. There may be an opportunity infront of you that is greater than what I see. So take my advice with a grain of salt. Good Luck!",,

This  entire series is made up of information I have found online, it is not   original nor my own work. I am not an expert and I much prefer relying   on the work of respected voices in finance.

**95%   of it is taken word for word from Prof. Aswath Damodoran's lecture   slides that he makes available for free. He teaches at NYU and has an   amazing Youtube channel with full courses on various aspects of   corporate finance. I have also sprinkled in some additional information   from other sources like Harvard Business School and others.**

# The Cash Flow Statement

The  main objective of the Cash Flow Statement (or Statement of Cash Flows)  is to explain how much and why the cash balance of a business changed  during the period of analysis.

**The cash flow statement is typically broken into three sections:**

* **Operating activities**
   * Detail  cash flow that’s generated once the company delivers its regular  goods  or services, and includes both revenue and expenses.
* **Investing activities**
   * Include  cash flow from purchasing or selling assets—think physical  property,  such as real estate or vehicles, and non-physical property,  like  patents—using free cash, not debt.
* **Financing activities**
   * Detail cash flow from both debt and equity financing.

>Based  on the cash flow statement, you can see how much cash different types  of activities generate, then make business decisions based on  your  analysis of financial statements.  
Ideally,  a company’s cash from operating income should routinely exceed its net  income, because a positive cash flow speaks to a  company’s ability to  remain solvent and grow its operations.  
It’s  important to note that cash flow is different from profit, which is why  a cash flow statement is often interpreted together with other  financial documents, such as a balance sheet and income statement.

**However, you will also find other information:**

* How much cash earnings the company had during the period, as contrasted with accrual earnings (in income statements)
* How much and where the company reinvested cash during the period to sustain and grow its business
* How much cash it raised from or returned to its debt and equity investors

The  Cash Flow Statement preserves the signs on cash flows, with negative  cash flows shown as minuses and positive cash flows as pluses. It also  looks at cash flows through the eyes of equity investors in the company.

**Positive cash flow**

* Indicates  that a company has more  money flowing into the business than out of it  over a specified period.  This is an ideal situation to be in because  having an excess of cash  allows the company to reinvest in itself and  its shareholders, settle  debt payments, and find new ways to grow the  business.
* Positive  cash flow does not necessarily translate to profit, however.  Your  business can be profitable without being cash flow-positive, and  you  can have positive cash flow without actually making a profit.

**Negative cash flow**

* Having **negative cash**  flow means your cash outflow is  higher than your cash inflow during a  period, but it doesn’t  necessarily mean profit is lost. Instead,  negative cash flow may be  caused by expenditure and income mismatch,  which should be addressed as  soon as possible.
* Negative  cash flow may also be caused by a company’s decision to  expand the  business and invest in future growth, so it’s important to  analyze  changes in cash flow from one period to another, which can  indicate how  a company is performing overall.

# Cash Flows from Operations

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [**https://imgur.com/GEBa8Zy**](https://imgur.com/GEBa8Zy) 

**Working Capital**

Embedded in the cash flow from operations is the **change in working capital items, excluding cash**

* Non-cash Working capital = Non-cash current assets – Non-debt current liabilities
* An  increase in non-cash working capital will decrease cash flows, whereas a  decrease in non-cash working capital will increase cash flows.

Non-cash  working capital ties up cash and capital, a firm with higher needs for  that working capital will have lower cash flows from operations, for any  given level of net income, than a firm with lower needs.

# Cash Flows from Investing

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [**https://imgur.com/TYgP2y8**](https://imgur.com/TYgP2y8) 

**Operating or Non-operating Assets**

* The  investing activities section includes investments in both operating and  non-operating assets, except for investment in liquid, close to  riskless securities, which is treated as cash & marketable  securities.
* The  investments into operating assets, whether internal (capex, net of  divestitures) or external (acquisitions of other companies) are the  engine that drives growth in the operating line items (revenues,  operating income etc.)

>*Note that acquisitions funded with stock will not show up here for obvious reasons.*

* The  investments into non-operating assets create a separate source of  value, where the payoff will not show up in the operating line items but  below the operating income line, as income from cross holdings or  securities.

# Cash Flows from Financing

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [**https://imgur.com/JqZv2kY**](https://imgur.com/JqZv2kY) 

**Debt Cash Flows**

* While  interest expenses show up in the operating cash flow section, by  reducing net income and showing up in deferred taxes, debt repayments  are part of the financing section.
* To  the extent that some or all of these debt repayments are funded with  debt issuance's, the net effect on cash flows can be neutralized or  become positive.

>**If  total debt increases during a period, it will represent a cash inflow,  and if it decreases, it will be a cash outflow. Companies that embark on  plans to bring their debt down (up) over time should therefore expect  these consequences.**

**Dividends and Buybacks**

* Until  the 1980s, the only cash flow that was received by equity investors in  publicly traded companies was dividends. The effect of paying dividends  is simple: it reduces the cash balance of the company and increases the  cash in the pockets of every shareholder who receives dividends.
* Starting in the 1980s, US companies have returned increasing amounts to their shareholders in the form of buybacks.  

   * The effect of buying back stock is exactly the same as paying dividends, to the company, with cash leaving the company.
   * For  shareholders, though, the cash flow effect is disparate. Those  shareholders who sell their shares back get cash from the company, and  those that do not get no cash, but get a larger share of the equity left  in the company.
   * Both dividends and buybacks reduce shareholder equity on the balance sheet.

**Potential Dividends (Free Cash Flow to Equity)**

597,,2021-05-28 12:04:58,t3_nmwdby,,stocks,"This is a reminder to all emotional investors/traders out there: Don't panic sell!

I made a bunch of stupid moves the week of May 10 when the market was taking its second downturn. If I just walked way from my computer for 2 weeks, most of the moves I made would have recovered. But unstead now I'm sitting on missed gains because I got too emotional.

Investing/trading is not about emotion. It's about having a plan and sticking to it.

I'm terrible at it because I still panic when macro factors test the strength of my plan.

Here are some of the lessons I'd like new traders/investors to really take to heart:

- When you buy a stock, have a VERY clear idea on why you bought, how long you're holding, and what your exit strategy is. I cannot stress this enough. There are many times where I bought a stock to flip, and I ended up holding it long term as a bag holder because I got greedy. And there are many times I bought stock I believed in, but ended up selling it on a correction because I panicked. Be incredibly regimented about this.

- Understand that corrections occur, and make a plan on how you'll deal with it. If you started buying high growth/beta stocks in January or February, you're account is probably down 20% from its peak. Thats okay, take a DEEP breath and think through your strategy. Did you leave any money to DCA your positions down? Ex. You bought ENPH at $220, its $140 right now. Do you still believe in ENPH? Why did you buy it at $220 and what has fundamentally changed about the company now that its at $140?

- Understand the power of averaging down.You can't time tops or bottoms. But you can make a strategy to mitigate risks. If any stocks you own have a beta higher than 2, seriously consider making an average down strategy. Averaging down is a very powerful tool, but you need to plan ahead for it. Stocks are great if they're only going up, but any high growth stock will come back down on small catalysts that throws into jeopardy their future growth. Those things can be macro factors as well such as interest rates and inflation fears. Here's a simple example using NIO. NIO was trading at $64 on January 20 after NIO day. There were definitely people who bought NIO at that price. Lets assume you bought 100 shares of NIO for $6400. NIO since then has been on a brutal slide. Its found its bottom at $31 twice now, but its still unclear what the real bottom is. At the same time, more analysts have reiterated that NIO is a buy with a price target of about $60. So your cost average is $64 with a 100 shares. NIO is sitting at $38 today. You know there's a 20% downside to $31, and maybe it goes lower. But you also know that it has a potential upside to $64. The reality is, if you believe in NIO, and were proactive enough to have $6400 stored in case of an event like this, if you bought 168 shares of NIO for $38, and averaged down your position you're cost average for NIO become a much more reasonable $47 rather than $64. That means NIO only has to gain 20% from its current price rather than 80%. I've seen this written in this subreddit before, but averaging down on a position is one the greatest opportunities. It lets you recommit to the original thesis you had for a stock, and it also creates a more advantageous position in the long term.

That said, be careful of ""buy the dip"". Understand why the dip is occurring. Compare the dip to macro factors like SPY and QQQ. Understand interest rates, inflation, international trade deals and other factors that could affect macro price movement. Use TA to understand support levels, and always be aware that things could drop more. April and May really tested the theory of ""it can't go any lower"". I was reading on this forum that April 27 was the end. That everything was going to recover since high flying stocks were on their bullish trajectory. Then we hit an inflation panic and the market corrected all high growth stocks by about 20%. OUCH.



Here's my big mistake. When I had no extra money to average down, and the stocks kept falling in May, I panicked. I managed to make it through February and March and most of April without panicking and selling. But May did me in. I ended up selling stocks to preserve capital, and most of those stocks are rebounding now and its making me realize that I wasn't as mentally strong as I thought.

Don't make these mistakes I did. Please make a strategy for yourself and stick with it! And don't keep changing strategies on a whim. That's another thing that will lead to compounding losses rather than tweaking and honing your strategy for what works for you!",nmwdby,Lessons from an emotional investor/trader

# The Cash Flow Statement

The   main objective of the Cash Flow Statement (or Statement of Cash Flows)   is to explain how much and why the cash balance of a business changed   during the period of analysis.

**The cash flow statement is typically broken into three sections:**

* **Operating activities**
   * Detail   cash flow that’s generated once the company delivers its regular   goods  or services, and includes both revenue and expenses.
* **Investing activities**
   * Include   cash flow from purchasing or selling assets—think physical  property,   such as real estate or vehicles, and non-physical property,  like   patents—using free cash, not debt.
* **Financing activities**
   * Detail cash flow from both debt and equity financing.

>Based   on the cash flow statement, you can see how much cash different types   of activities generate, then make business decisions based on  your   analysis of financial statements.Ideally,  a company’s cash from  operating income should routinely exceed its net  income, because a  positive cash flow speaks to a  company’s ability to  remain solvent and  grow its operations.It’s  important to note that cash flow is different  from profit, which is why  a cash flow statement is often interpreted  together with other  financial documents, such as a balance sheet and  income statement.

**However, you will also find other information:**

* How much cash earnings the company had during the period, as contrasted with accrual earnings (in income statements)
* How much and where the company reinvested cash during the period to sustain and grow its business
* How much cash it raised from or returned to its debt and equity investors

The   Cash Flow Statement preserves the signs on cash flows, with negative   cash flows shown as minuses and positive cash flows as pluses. It also   looks at cash flows through the eyes of equity investors in the company.

**Positive cash flow**

* Indicates   that a company has more  money flowing into the business than out of  it  over a specified period.  This is an ideal situation to be in  because  having an excess of cash  allows the company to reinvest in  itself and  its shareholders, settle  debt payments, and find new ways  to grow the  business.
* Positive   cash flow does not necessarily translate to profit, however.  Your   business can be profitable without being cash flow-positive, and  you   can have positive cash flow without actually making a profit.

**Negative cash flow**

* Having **negative cash**   flow means your cash outflow is  higher than your cash inflow during a   period, but it doesn’t  necessarily mean profit is lost. Instead,   negative cash flow may be  caused by expenditure and income mismatch,   which should be addressed as  soon as possible.
* Negative   cash flow may also be caused by a company’s decision to  expand the   business and invest in future growth, so it’s important to  analyze   changes in cash flow from one period to another, which can  indicate how   a company is performing overall.

# Cash Flows from Operations

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [**https://imgur.com/GEBa8Zy**](https://imgur.com/GEBa8Zy)

**Working Capital**

Embedded in the cash flow from operations is the **change in working capital items, excluding cash**

* Non-cash Working capital = Non-cash current assets – Non-debt current liabilities
* An   increase in non-cash working capital will decrease cash flows, whereas  a  decrease in non-cash working capital will increase cash flows.

Non-cash   working capital ties up cash and capital, a firm with higher needs for   that working capital will have lower cash flows from operations, for  any  given level of net income, than a firm with lower needs.

# Cash Flows from Investing

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [**https://imgur.com/TYgP2y8**](https://imgur.com/TYgP2y8)

**Operating or Non-operating Assets**

* The   investing activities section includes investments in both operating  and  non-operating assets, except for investment in liquid, close to   riskless securities, which is treated as cash & marketable   securities.
* The   investments into operating assets, whether internal (capex, net of   divestitures) or external (acquisitions of other companies) are the   engine that drives growth in the operating line items (revenues,   operating income etc.)

>*Note that acquisitions funded with stock will not show up here for obvious reasons.*

* The   investments into non-operating assets create a separate source of   value, where the payoff will not show up in the operating line items but   below the operating income line, as income from cross holdings or   securities.

# Cash Flows from Financing

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [**https://imgur.com/JqZv2kY**](https://imgur.com/JqZv2kY)

**Debt Cash Flows**

* While   interest expenses show up in the operating cash flow section, by   reducing net income and showing up in deferred taxes, debt repayments   are part of the financing section.
* To   the extent that some or all of these debt repayments are funded with   debt issuance's, the net effect on cash flows can be neutralized or   become positive.

>**If   total debt increases during a period, it will represent a cash inflow,   and if it decreases, it will be a cash outflow. Companies that embark  on  plans to bring their debt down (up) over time should therefore  expect  these consequences.**

**Dividends and Buybacks**

* Until   the 1980s, the only cash flow that was received by equity investors in   publicly traded companies was dividends. The effect of paying  dividends  is simple: it reduces the cash balance of the company and  increases the  cash in the pockets of every shareholder who receives  dividends.
* Starting in the 1980s, US companies have returned increasing amounts to their shareholders in the form of buybacks.
   * The effect of buying back stock is exactly the same as paying dividends, to the company, with cash leaving the company.
   * For   shareholders, though, the cash flow effect is disparate. Those   shareholders who sell their shares back get cash from the company, and   those that do not get no cash, but get a larger share of the equity left   in the company.
   * Both dividends and buybacks reduce shareholder equity on the balance sheet.

I've got a 20-30 year time frame and plan on adding every month to sp500 and world tracking etfs.

Even If it never weakens, the market will outpace the exchange rate.  From Jan 1, the exchange rate has lost you about 4% (1.365/1.420).  Sp500 is up 11% in that same time.

To calculate this stat as you defined it you would have to know the cost basis of every position in the market that was sold in a given day.  Cost basis is not available for any positions opened before 2011 because brokerages did not track it until then and as much as reddit is about short term trading there is a lot of money in the market for older generations that has been static for a lot  longer than that.  This stat is likely a made up number probably based on some sentiment surveys or other BS like new account creation or funding (which can also be skewed by people switching brokerages etc).

I am too lazy to type a full-on DD. If this gets enough traction then I will do it with numbers. Basically, this is the best ganja plant company on planet Earth and is undervalued right now trading at 1.4x consensus rates compared to a trash peer group trading at 8x that on average. They are projected to have 115 stores EOY in Canada. They bought out FABCBD in the US and operate the largest E-Commerce platforms for cannabis in the world. Many of you have probably heard of GrassCity, CBDCity, and Smoke Cartel (they own these). They have celebrity licensing with Snoop and others and thousands of SKUs. They have a super clean balance sheet and positive adjusted EBITDA. They are cash positive and vertically integrated and scaling massively YOY with a dynamic team in place. They have plans to expand world-wide and continue to make great deals and acquisitions monthly. This is truly the best weed play on the entire market with tremendous upside. They just got approved to trade on the NASDAQ as well. It is currently trading at around $8. Personal PT EOY is $50. I can easily see this at $500 in 6 years or so. Do your research as I am not a financial advisor. I own 420 shares. I will answer any and all questions my fellow apes have.

I was wrong, and the bear performance of my portfolio from February through May is reinforcement that I don't know shit.

Reading and learning are different than experiencing and adapting. I'm still learning from my failures, and the challenge I had was that I didn't stick to my strategy. Things that I am still working on personally:

- creating a cost average down strategy

- not looking at account value as be all and end all

- creating a mental strategy that any high flying stock is actually 50% of its value at any one time

 > No. The hard part of investing is holding on to your ass when you suffer a 50% paper loss. No one is too smart to suffer this, and what separates good traders from bad is how you react to the pressure cooker.

Yes, suffering a 50% paper loss is brutal. I think seeing the game-ification of my stock portfolio has warped my mind to a min/max style of behaviour. Which is a great way to get eaten by the market.

The last element that really hurt me is benchmarking. I didn't do good benchmarking, which means I didn't know how to take gains off the able when I was up, and also I cut losses after being oversold instead of averaging down and waiting for a revision back to the mean in my favourable direction.

It's impossible to have both cash and debt, so that excess means any overnight holdings are fully paid for. 

They can trade their excess margin balance from the night before with a 25% margin requirement, meaning they can buy stock worth 4X the cash they have. They can buy and sell that as many times as they want during the day.

They also have the option to use a special tax reporting method where they report their account value at the beginning and end of the year and add or deduct the difference as ordinary income. No wash sale rule, no $3k deduction limit, no detailed listings of basis and proceeds (unless they're audited and have to prove they really are a day trader as their job and not an ordinary investor; there's no clear IRS rule defining that, so having proof of entering and exiting significant positions nearly every trading day of the year is about all that works).

Thanks for the explanation and to all here who help others with insights not found anywhere else from what I've researched.  After having my stock act not doing much for over 15 yrs when in the hands of a friend who became a stock broker for E. Jones, I decided to take control of my own act and transferred it to TDA.  I never knew about synthetic shares.  Why hasn't the SEC done anything about these hedge funds using naked shorts prior to the GME event?  There are so many people who give their earnings to brokers with the trust in them and the SEC that their investment isn't subject to this kind of BS mainly because the avg investor doesn't know how much the stocks are manipulated by hedge funds.  The avg investor knows about speculation and risk but I don't think they know about synthetic shares.  Again, thanks to you all for the education I am getting here.",,
