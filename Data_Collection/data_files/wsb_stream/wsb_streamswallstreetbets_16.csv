If you're going to buy enough SPY calls, just buy SPX, and even if you're buying 1, just buy XSP. Should you somehow manage to pull gains, you get 60/40 long/short term capital gains, rather than 100% short term capital gains.

If you are a millionaire/hold 1000+ shares of SPY to sell covered calls, you could mimic a similar position in SPX, selling weeklies at the nicer tax rates as well. Even if you can't afford deep ITM SPX options, you can mimic a similar SPY position with deep ITM XSP options.

Not only this, but you are getting fucked by market makers if you buy SPY calls. You'll notice that the premium is quite a bit higher when compared against XSP.

If some girl’s a total slut and your whole social circle knows it then yeah have fun for a bit but ditch her for someone who actually respects themselves. If the issue is oh no she’s been in a real, mature, committed relationship with one guy then yeah I think it’s your insecurity.

Considering interest went through the roof, I’m assuming there were some shorts who realized it was cheaper to gtfo in January than to hold and continue to get killed by interest. If we all realized the price wasn’t going back down to 5, you don’t think they did too? In January you could’ve gotten out for 250 bucks a share let’s say, today you still are paying that 250, but you’ve also paid 4 months of interest on borrowed shares. 
I’m fairly confident that most of the old shorts got out in January and February. And that there are a ton of new shorts who got in in the meantime.",,

4 million shares were borrowed to knock us down.. Let that sink in.. 4 million for that attack.. 

We closed yesterday at 1.4% higher than today.. After all of that, they only knocked us down 1.4%.. They threw everything they had at us and we held the line like true diamond handed, bad ass, rocket riding, moon traveling, tendie munching, sexy ape bastages.

I compare what I saw today watching an entire army, 4 million strong, charging a castle with everything it had and getting completely mowed down before a single soldier got through the door.

You won, make no mistake about it. I am so freaking proud of you people.. I'm like emotional right now.. 

You are going to stick it to these slimy, hedgies. We are going to make them pay for crashing the market, for making husbands and wives kill themselves due to bankruptcy at their hands, for destroying families and businesses with their greed. We are not holding for money.. Well, we are...lol.. But we are also holding for principle.. Because we can freaking win.. And we will freakingl win. 

Kenny Griffin, Citadel CEO mocks us, big business mocks us, make no mistake about it.. They underestimate us and that is their weakness..  They have traded in their safe spaces for too long. We are a new breed, they cannot beat us.. Hell, they don't even know hot to deal with us.. We are an enigma to them. And that is our strength. 

Do not falter Ape army.. Don't you freaking dare..

""The exercise price of each tranche was above the closing price of our stock of $2.62 on the date of grant. The stock option vests as follows: 28.57% of each tranche was immediately vested upon grant, and the remaining 71.43% of each tranche vests upon the conversion of $100,000,000 of our outstanding 5% Secured Convertible Promissory Notes due 2021 (the Notes). In the event a portion of the Notes is converted, a corresponding pro rata portion of the 71.43% of each tranche will vest. In addition, if any of the Notes is repaid or otherwise extinguished without being converted, a corresponding pro rata portion of the 71.43% of each tranche will be forfeited upon such repayment. The stock option expires on February 19, 2026.  
  
The purpose of the grant was to protect Mr. Continenza from the economic dilution attributable to the issuance of the Notes, which affected the value of the options granted upon his becoming Executive Chairman of the Company (the Original Grant). This stock option has the same exercise prices and term as the Original Grant and was generally designed to put Mr. Continenza in the same economic position he would have been in had the Notes been repaid instead of converted into common stock.  
  
The stock option vested with respect to 471,405 shares (28.57% of each tranche) at the time of grant on July 27, 2020. The stock option vested with respect to an additional 1,119,665 shares (67.86% of each tranche) upon the conversion of 95% of the Notes on July 29, 2020, and the stock option vested with respect to the remaining 58,930 shares (3.57% of each tranche) upon the conversion of the remaining 5% of the Notes on September 30, 2020.""",,

993,,2021-05-30 01:14:44,t3_no0ixl,,wallstreetbets,"I know everyone is all about AMC and GME right now and by all means I have nothing but love for the Apes putting up the fight. I paper handed my AMC shares literally right before this last jump like an idiot. I bring up BBBY because right now it has a higher short percentage of float than both AMC and GME.

According to Yahoo Finance as of 5/14/2021 the short percentage of float for each of these companies is:

GME - 29.34%
AMC - 21.13%
BBBY - 64.38%

BBBY also just announced a partnership with DoorDash to offer same day delivery. The stock jumped on this news. Additionally, BBBY is poised to benefit from restrictions being lifted as a reopening play.

Unfortunately, the analysts don’t have much consensus on the stock. BofA recommends it as a buy with a 12 month target of $38 in a report published on 5/28/2021. Morningstar recommends to hold with a target price of $22, but that report was on 4/21/2021. I suspect Morningstar will come out with an updated report in the near future. CFRA rates it as a sell with a target price of $16 in a report published on 5/29/2021. Seems pretty conservative given that the stock hasn’t been at that level since September of last year. Maybe they have some short interest 🤷‍♂️.

Before I YOLO a large percentage of my portfolio into some call options, I wanted to get your thoughts/opinions on the stock to see if I’m missing something.",no0ixl,Why is no one talking about BBBY?
