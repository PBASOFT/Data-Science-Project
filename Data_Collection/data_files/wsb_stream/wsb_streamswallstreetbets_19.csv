BECAUSE what we are doing has hurt HF‚Äôs so much with GME and now AMC. They say laws or intervention is needed. What irks me on this is the host of the money channel sits there and helps to disseminate this crap, it‚Äôs like subliminally they acknowledge this, with fog in their eyes and without words are basically saying ‚ÄúYES sir! Let us make sure the little guy can‚Äôt play, and only HFs‚Äô with Billions are the only ones that can make Billions and rule the rigged market. 

We all know they are powerful, and thus we fight. We are not Communist yet, or at least full blown, but have started becoming now in so many ways, it is sad, so sad. All the low information voters out there have no clue to what is coming at them. They do not realize what a new Socialism Totalitarianism system of Gov means for them. If they got their new Gov, they would soon realize with horror, that the leaders would control their education, field of work, impose food restrictions, health care limitations, unable to set aside their own $$ for retirement, lose privacy to their bank accounts, and become subservient. They will be slaves in the New World Order. IT is pathetically sad to see this.

My Prayer for Trey (his health) and all of us is this.

Oh Lord, grant us Apes to win a small battle, and should we be granted this new found wealth reward oh Lord, help us to be better servants, better givers, and take care of our less fortunate brothers and sisters, and to become better brothers, sisters, spouses and humble ourselves.

Thank you, Lord. Amen

It‚Äôs mainly that is was and is a low float stock that is owned by majority black business. The company just completed an agreement for the first black majority owned casino in Virginia. The stock saw a good jump from 4.60-10.68 on 130 million volume, that is nothing compared to AMC or Game stock! The great news is that UONE has held its support of the low 7s since its pump. But with Juneteenth coming up, it is primed and ready for a move more than AMC, with a low float that is. Let‚Äôs freakin make UONE a rocket ship coming up. At least put it on your radar. We can make UONE go higher than $54, which is what it did last year at this time. Let‚Äôs make each other money the up coming two weeks in UONE!

Sacerdote has a 3-year return of 197.48% as of 3/31/21, and an annualized weighted 3-year return of 43.82%

He has trimmed TSLA, SHOP, PTON, PINS, and CRWD, and has loaded up on AMZN, GOOGL, and FB. No, this isn‚Äôt the end of growth stocks, and I am certainly holding on to mine. However, it may be safe to allocate some capital into proven, cash-generating companies.""

That already squeezed. But logic dictated, right? I made a tidy sum off of this, and there's still money to be made here. It only got a bad valuation because it was a meme stock tied to the gme thing (which was nuked, truth be told, there was more money there but it was blocked and sold off cheaper than it should have been), but it's the fucking movie theater. Do you want to go? I really do. And they're the big one in every town. I'll keep being right for about a year. It's gonna go up. Squeeze or not, there's actual value here. IDK how you found this post, but I don't often give financial advice on reddit besides ""that's dumb, why would you do that?"" This isn't dumb. 

Keep doing it. This is actual financial advice, I'm not scared to say it. I bought in to a few theater chain stocks right when they started lifting the ""stay away from everything"" protocols and I made BANK. There's still money in this banana stand. You popped up two months after the fact somehow, I don't know how you found this but it's advice just for you. Nobody else is gonna see it. Things to look at right now? Darden group, the people who own olive garden and longhorn steak house. AMC. Cinemark. You'll actually print money. Applebees. Places people can go that you would think of, right off the top of your head, that you couldn't go all year. They're about to post massive earnings. The market is gonna crash soon, so this is short term advice. Hit it and quit it. We have about two years tops before the market fucking dies because of what Trump did to boost it, the quantitative easing is actually poison for the market. It's when, not if. The interest rates are gonna pop back up and you want absolutely no money in the market when it happens. The next six months to a year? This is the way.

Reddit has become deluded into thinking we have some major power over the investment firms and as though we can easily squeeze them. The squeeze already happened, that's why it rocketed to this price. I would highly recommend people not to hold/buy based on Reddit hype. You see this same shit time and time again from people desperate to keep people holding so they can hopefully make it go a bit higher and then jump out. If it's making it into mainstream news and Reddit front page, it's generally too late to invest big. Because that's a sign the average person knows and will have invested and there isn't much more room to rally.

If it will significantly financially impact you for the price to drop back down a fair bit, then please do not hold onto such a volatile stock. At the very least you better be ready to sell at a moments notice or have stop-loss/take-profit orders setup. And certainly do not buy in big at this point in time, it's too late for a big move like that.

3-year Return: 197.48%  
3-year Annualized Weighted Returns: 43.82%
2. **Crosslink Capital - Seymour Kaufman**  
3-year Return: 186.27%  
3-year Annualized Weighted Returns: 41.99%
3. **Sequoia Capital Global Equities (SCGE) Management - Jeff Wang**  
3-year Return: 171.53%  
3-year Annualized Weighted Returns: 39.51%

Alex Sacerdote is clearly leading the pack; what's even more impressive is that he manages $12 billion dollars, while Kaufman manages $551 million and Wang manages $8.9B. In fact, out of the Top 20 Performing hedge funds, Sacerdote comes in only second to Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management, who has the most assets under management (AUM) of $18 billion.

Whale Rock has a 3-year return of 197.48% as of 3/31/21, and an annualized weighted 3-year return of 43.82%

He has trimmed TSLA, SHOP, PTON, PINS, and CRWD, and has loaded up on AMZN, GOOGL, and FB. No, this isn‚Äôt the end of growth stocks, and I am certainly holding on to mine. However, it may be safe to allocate some capital into proven, cash-generating companies. Stay safe everyone!

669,,2021-05-30 03:14:32,t3_no2bec,,wallstreetbets," I am an old retard. I fought in the great short wars for the good side at Take Two Interactive and Green Mountain Coffee. But fighting shorts is easy compared to stupid politicians and news reporters. Join me in this epic fight between smart and stupid. Good and evil. 

I have been a long-time investor in Emergent BioSolutions (EBS)***.*** ***For 20 years, this Company has made vaccines and treatments that save millions of lives around the world*** from Smallpox, Anthrax, Botulism, Cholera, Typhoid and radiation sickness. Before COVID, our country‚Äôs biggest healthcare crisis was opioid addiction.  EBS makes the NARCAN nasal spray that first responders rely on to rescue overdose patients. When COVID hit our country last year, the company went into overdrive to retrofit one of 3 manufacturing facilities in the US that US government designated in 2012 to ‚Äúensure domestic pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturing surge capacity.‚Äù It should have taken years, but in months they developed the ability to manufacture 1 billion doses of COVID vaccine. 

***And today they are one of the most hated company in Washington and on Wall Street.*** 

**Why?** The reason is partisan politicians, their cronies in the press and short sellers want to kill this company for political gain. Here is the math: Trump = BAD. But, Trump = Operation Warp Speed = Vaccine Success = County is Saved. To square the equation, Operation Warp Speed must be discredited for saving the county and discrediting Emergent is the answer.

**Here are the Company‚Äôs crimes against our Nation:** 

1) According to the New York Times, the Company‚Äôs success in preparing the US from a bio-terrorism attack from Anthrax took too much money from our Federal budget and that is why we had no stockpile for PPE (personal protective equipment). 

Response: Seriously, this idiotic conclusion was supported by the bureaucrat responsible for our emergency stockpile of PPE. They blame EBS, a company that has nothing to do with PPE, for the US not having PPE! The NYT published what could only be described as a very lengthy delusional diatribe against spending money in support of national bio-terrorism defense. They don‚Äôt see the connection of the lack of preparedness for a global pandemic being a problem and the lack of preparedness from bioterrorism?

2) EBS screwed up making one of the first 15 production batches of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine and had to destroy what could have been 10 million doses. Worse yet, the foul up was because they contaminated the batch with material used in AstraZeneca‚Äôs (AZ) vaccine. 

Response: I should have mentioned, the US Government told EBS to manufacture both J&J‚Äôs and AZ‚Äôs vaccine at the same time, in the same facility that they were retrofitting 24/7 to go from zero to 1 billion of annual doses. I know politicians and NYT reporters know nothing about how things get made, but the challenge this company was given was massive and shit happens. Today, EBS has over 100 million doses ready to ship ‚Äì if the FDA releases them.

3) An assorted list of Stalinist crap ranging from executive pay is high, drugs should be free, lobbyists are bad, and the manufacturing plant should be cleaner.  

Response: There is every effort to tie the company to TRUMP. But the original contract for COVID production was awarded under the Obama / Biden Administration and bioterrorism defense is hopefully not a partisan topic for long. EBS is attacked for cutting corners in ramping the production of vaccines, including having chipped paint on the warehouse floor. It‚Äôs almost like we had declared war on COVID and had directed them to move at Warp Speed! 

**What‚Äôs Next**: EBS believes they have corrected the manufacturing issues and stopped making the AZ vaccine to avoid further mix ups. With FDA approval, EBS could start tomorrow making 1 billion doses of J&J vaccines per year. Those vaccines could be shipped around the world courtesy of the USA. Or we could give our patented technology away to China and hope they can ramp up in a few years to supply the world and the US the next time they lose control of a virus.

Why do the politicians want EBS vilified? Mostly because Operation Warp Speed worked so well that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines make the J&J miracle unnecessary. It‚Äôs true that J&J and AZ‚Äôs solutions were based on science that has been used to develop vaccines for decades. Pfizer and Moderna used the fancy new mRNA technology which had never saved anyone. So, a year ago, the safe bet for our country was J&J and EBS. 

The stock has been cut in half by the New York Times‚Äô ridiculous reporting and stupid politicians out for petty political gain. 

***But this is a good company.*** ***Profitable.***  ***Liquid.*** ***Diversified.*** ***And any company that can save millions of lives with their products will win over the idiots.*** ***This is an easy double.***",no2bec,EVIL PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO KILL EMERGENT BIOSOLUTIONS AND THAT WILL KILL PEOPLE

Let me introduce to you a highly oversold stock that will rebound greatly in the near future. Ive included plenty of pictures for you fellow degenerates.

&#x200B;

NRG Energy is in the business of producing, selling, and delivering electricity to over 3.6 million residential, industrial, and commercial consumers by means of natural gas, coal, oil, solar, nuclear and battery storage.

$NRG has been on the decline since taking an estimated loss of 750 million due to the Texas winter storm. It is currently sitting at a -23% discount at $32.15 a share. The RSI is currently at 28.9 indicating its been oversold. After a rough 2021 beginning NRG's earnings are projected to be be back on track after the anomaly that was storm Uri.

&#x200B;

[STRONG BUY](https://preview.redd.it/47ks25o736271.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b43fabc8b015b62d2ab6274f44d827906d53f5f)

As you can see above the average price consensus is currently at $44.6 a share and has maintained  BUY rating since may 2020. I believe the bottom is here and so do many other investors. As you can see below there has been an influx in volume of calls this past Thursday and Friday betting on an increase in price in the short term.

&#x200B;

Now lets get to the only part you care about... the positions. Anything a few months out or longer will be a good approach. I will be picking up some further out exp. on Tuesday along with my more aggressive short dated calls. This shitty DD is not financial advice. Don't overlook this opportunity while chasing the next hottest meme to baghold.

I'm sitting here atop the world in my penthouse, blasted out of my mind going through a bliss brought on by an euphoric shopping blitz through Union Square, whereupon I bought scarves, cufflinks, ties, sneakers, and jackets. It is of my opinion that retail therapy is an efficient, systematic stress reliever, able to cheer up anyone in a down state. This jubilation only scales exponentially with the amount I spend, and isn't related to the time I spent shopping, nor what I bought.
