But in saying that, I do believe in charitable rigging of the game, so the little guy has a fighting chance. That's how you shut the commies up.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

The risk/reward is worth entering a trade here. I bought yesterday around 10$. My stop loss is below 8$.

Let me explain something real quick that everyone needs to get behind if this is going to work. This is an investment in a business which can üöÄ regardless of our level of support. We have an opportunity here to make history & make this company really takeoff just  like Tesla & AmazonüöÄ. So here is the important thing to remember. Stay in, no matter what. Even after you hit your goal. Stay in. (You might regret it later) Let me explain why: üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄm.hüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Say you get into AMC and plan to buy some thing with your CASH. Let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs a Tesla for god sake, if this stock hits $100 in value, & you think that‚Äôs a good chunk & get nervous & you pull out, then it all avalanches, everyone pulls out. And all this fails. Now say it hits $1000  in value, & you pull out, then it avalanches, then everyone pulls out, & It all fails . Now let‚Äôs say we all stay until it‚Äôs well into 1k(like Tesla), 2k(like google), 3K(like Amazon) and beyond  (Berkshire Hathaway) 400k üöÄ. You pull out a fraction, and you have what you wanted) AND MOST IMPORTANTLY the stock stays strong, and we all win.
Control APES üêµ. Patients APES üêµ. We all chip in, we all stay patient, it‚Äôs no longer a meme or a gimmick. It gains legitimacy AS MORE TIME PASSES, other investors develop confidence in it. You get what you want and more, but that means staying in even if you‚Äôre sweating bullets and pay out looks sweet. Godspeed everyone. Let‚Äôs get rich together. And let‚Äôs get our kids rich as well. (Just imagine if AMC got into the streaming service 2-3 years from now)

The current system of using a paper derivative market to set price discovery of physical silver is a broken system, and it was designed to be broken.  The tail is wagging the dog.

You buy a $1000 contract from a construction company for the right but not the obligation to buy 10(ten) $100,000 houses in a new under construction neighborhood of 200 houses. Construction on those houses will be finished by Dec 1 2021 and you have until that date to decide whether you want to buy 10 of those houses at that price ($100,000). As construction continues, the prices of those houses go up and down because of the housing market and because people can start to see how those houses are looking as they are being completed. You can exercise your right to that contract at any time up until construction is complete, but once the construction is completed on Dec 1 2021, you have to decide if you want to exercise your right to buy those houses at $100,000 or that contract will void and you would‚Äôve paid $1,000 for nothing . You can also sell that contract to anyone else to give them the right to buy those houses at that price.

ANYONE can buy those houses, and they don‚Äôt have to buy your contract from you to buy any of those houses. In fact, someone can buy ALL of those houses in that neighborhood and there will be none left for sale, but luckily for you If you exercised your contract then the construction company that sold you that contract will be forced to buy 10 of those houses at whatever the price is at that time to sell to you because they wrote you that contract and they are obligated to fulfill it , even if they have to pay $1,000,000 per house out of their own pocket to hand them to you (ie example of a naked short)",,gzxy9ti,t1_gzxarzq

This got me thinking... what if there was a post about AMC that mentions the word AMC a lot and then got a lot of comments with the word AMC in it, as well? That might help skew the AMC-related AMC mentions a bit in those statistics. In fact, any post about AMC with AMC-related content would help AMC show up higher in the AMC-related reports. One might choose to write a pretty long AMC post and talk about how great AMC actually is and how AMC will go to the AMC moon very soon. I think we should project the AMC logo on the moon, actually. Speaking of AMC logo on the moon, have you ever realized that AMC spelled backward doesn't actually read AMC at all?

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

The risk/reward is worth entering a trade here. I bought yesterday around 10$. My stop loss is below 8$.
