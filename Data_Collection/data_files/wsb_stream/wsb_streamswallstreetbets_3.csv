I just watched some Korean youtube channel talking about AMC stock that on June 2, $500 million of paid-in capital increase will be decided according to the vote result.

But, I heard somewhere that even if this happens, Adam(CEO) will not going to make it by 2021 which is a clear sign that he is on our side.

But I was not able to find the official remarks or sources that he claimed it.

Is there anyone who is keen on this? If you have any resource dealing with this, please let me know. Thanks.",nmnmxi,AMC!!!!!!! What is going to be decided on June 2?

The above link is what I said 2 days ago. At the time EXPI was hovering around $28.50 and since then it has shot up to about $32.27 on what appears to be about average volume for the stock. 

I still think they are going to have a huge share buyback of over 14m shares (their buyback program was increased from 75m to 475m) in stock and add to the insider owned shares which is now at 54.80% over the week it has gone up about 2%. Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity. Also the buyback would be large enough to trigger a massive buy and I would jizz my pants.",nmnbfw,*UPDATE* Why I still Think EXPI Is Going To $60 In 4-6 Weeks (up 10.59% this week)

It’s easier to pump and dump a stock if you have a massive amount of people continuously holding and effectively reducing the float. Less people selling and more people holding makes for these massive jumps when a gamma squeeze happens, especially for GME because it already has a relatively small float to begin with so you can see it jump massively even on small volume like it did last week. And believe me, there are definitely big players in WSB that are aware of this and taking profits along the way. And to be honest, the same situation works for bears, reduced float makes the share borrow price go higher but at the same time, they can force the stock value down massively on short volume- this scenario works in both directions.

Listen, I’m not here to argue the whole “shorts haven’t covered yet” because that’s something neither you nor I can definitively prove. What I will say is this. You wanna diamond hands AMC or GME? That’s perfectly fine, I was there, and did my part and am actually looking to get back into GME at a decent price to go thetagang to collect the massive premiums. What I will say is this. If you put some more money into your account for amc or GME, go ahead and diamond hand what your holding now, but any new money you put in, play the other side to this- as in- if amc goes down to like $10 again and you buy 100 more shares, start using that to take profits. If it runs to 30, great! take profit and wait for it to come back down to 10 and buy in for 300 shares. Wash rinse and repeat this cycle and you will be growing your position and profits every other month (because it seems to spike in cycles). Shit, if you triple your money and you wanna really gamble with house money, wait for it to go to $10 and buy a bunch of ITM leaps and sit on them. That’s a leveraged position so you do that and it jumps to $30, you’ll make a fucking mint. 

I’m not saying any of this to be a gay bear or to talk you out of diamond handing. I love amc and GME. I think it’s presenting a rare opportunity in the market to allow people to see pretty definitive entry and exit points to make money. I’m taking my time to type all this because I want to see you and anyone else reading turning a profit and actually making some money in this advantageous situation.

TL/DR- so yeah, I am all for diamond handing. But any new money added, do yourself a favor and use that to make profits and grow so that you can start multiplying your returns by repeating the cycle.",,

Until about Thursday I believe is when it started tanking. Selling the “news” doesnt always mean the day its expected. By then the weekly high has usually been reached and the smart investors have already taken profits well before the selloff for the “news” or episode of SNL goes live. Its truly a guess as to when the best time to sell is, but I recommend not waiting until day of news unless you believe that news will raise the price. As soon as the show aired it started tanking.

236,gzvqc6s,2021-05-29 15:51:13,t1_gzvqc6s,t1_gzvf7cc,wallstreetbets,"Right, so here is my take on what the situation is, but i snort crayons for all you know so not financial advice: 

As stupid as it sounds, we can literally just buy more such that those shorts are underwater as well. And those shorts'll cover fueling our push and more shorts with take their place at a higher pricepoint. And then we can buy more such that those shorts are underwater as well. Ad infinitum.

The important thing to understand is that the price of a stock in a market is determined by buy pressure and sell pressure. A short is selling pressure in the now and guaranteed buying pressure in the future. People keep talking about ""when the bagholders start to leave"". Here's the reality: It costs a short to maintain their position every single day. It costs you nothing to hold your stock. The risk of a short is infinite, while at worst you lose almost all of whatever happened to be in your bank account. So peanuts lmao. Imagine playing a game of chicken where you're in a monster truck and the other guy is on a tricycle and one of you has to decide to get out of the way first. This is the situation AMC stockholders are in. There is no reason to ever sell at a loss when the stock has this much short interest (future buying pressure) and this in and of itself will prevent the stock from falling in price. The short interest will also continue to climb as people continue to short not understanding that the short interest is in and of itself the appeal of the stock. No one investing in AMC gives a s*** about fundamentals. Fundamentals don't dictate stock movement. Buy and sell pressure do.


And a side note: Do you know how much money people spend on lottery tickets every year in the united states alone? These are the kinds of people pouring into AMC, and I'll contend it's actually a really resilient investor base. These people have steady income and they want something they can put money into that feels like it could be life-changing. I don't think the AMC climb is by any means over, we'll likely see high 40s next week at least, even higher from there potentially but no one can read the future.",,

Naturally the market price was below the price you paid for it, obviously, because of the dealer's percentage (else they wouldn't trade), maybe a margin (large or small?) , and the postage, and maybe the insurance .. can be expensive.. so what percentage over the going price did you pay. That's the only question worth asking ain't it? - In ANY deal - what is the REAL total price to **you** compared to the market price.. because that's the price you have to sell above to make a profit.

Plenty of companies now claiming to sell ""at market price"" and buy back ""at market price"" -  as long as you leave your silver in a vault in Singapore  (I guess it is REALLY there, right, because would they lie? nah, it's got your sticker on it)

If you want them to send it to you from Singapore (I guess)  they charge 7-12% insurance and postage. And that's assuming they sold it to you at the ""real"" going price (plus their dealer percentage). So you are def paying 10% over the odds to get it in your hands. the rate commodities move, that could take a while to win back.. maybe? 

Well, some silver dealers even swear they make 0% brokerage and you can sell it right back to them for the exact same price you paid for it.  
Strange way to run a business, that, ain't it? Wonder how they make a living on 0% ??

Good luck with you and your silver, hope it turns out good.   
It just takes a little thought beforehand, and not let yourself be impressed by that word ""**silver**"".. it's a commodity like any other. We need it for electronics.   
And it 'impresses' people - ain't nothing else special about it.",,

DISCLAIMER: This post is NOT Financial Advice!  
   
  
This is actual DD of just statistical, cold hard facts.
  
  
[I have access to Bloomberg Terminal with up to date data as of May 29th on institutional holdings. Institutions currently hold 177% of the float!](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png)  
  
  
[How is this even possible to own more than 100% of the float?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp) Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages. Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.  
  
  
In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.  
   
  
I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. [~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.](https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg)  
  
  
[This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)  

So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.   
  
  
Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when order flows go directly through Citadel. [But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.](https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png) Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.  
  
  
With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. [Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.](https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png) And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above. Thank you for taking your time to read my DD.

Look at the yearly chart. After last year’s George Floyd incident, this stock ran up 2800% from $1 to $54 in a matter of 7 days last year for Juneteenth.

Juneteenth is an African American holiday celebrating emancipation. It’s already experienced a 100% run up from $4 to almost $9 just 10 days ago, in anticipation for the explosion which will almost certainly happen again this year. Since the run up last week, it’s fell to $7 per share making this a golden opportunity to get in before she runs back to $50+ per share.

On top of all of this, they’ve just secured a casino in richmond VA which will go to a city vote on June 14th. So much potential for this to blow. If the city approves, this will fly then, and continue to fly leading up to Juneteenth on the 19th. So many potential catalysts in the coming 2 weeks. 

M’y fellow 🦍’s, let’s organize our effort and reap the rewards. Go look at that one year chart. Thank you for your time.",,

You pay them the price of the option as premium in exchange for the contract to buy 100 shares at the strike by the expiration.

Options have intrinsic and extrinsic value. Intrinsic value is what they’re worth if immediately exercised, so only ITM calls have intrinsic value. Extrinsic value is calculated using the Greeks, with Delta determining the amount by which the value of the option changes based on the price of the underlying, gamma is the first derivative of delta, theta tells you how much value the call loses every day before expiry, and Vega tells you the option’s sensitivity to IV (which you can also see in the options chain).

Disclaimer 

This is my first shot at a DD since joining a year ago. Just as a disclaimer I’m kinda retarded and not an expert at financial advise. I also hold 70 shares so I’m definitely biased. 

What the hell is NNDM? 

Nano Dimension is technology company that specializes in 3D printing computer chips. The are aimed at disrupting the current method of computer chip manufacturing called PCB (Printed Circuit Board). 

Why should you care? 

As technology develops the need for more complex computer chips increases. Normal PCB fabrication is limited in is manufacturing capabilities. Nano Dimensions printers can print in 3D with multiple materials, allowing for better optimization of electronics. This has the ability to disrupt the ~$60 billion dollar PCB market. Also imagine having the capability of 3D printing chips in space without having to be resupplied every time you need electronics equipment. 

Not only does their product have the potential to be revolutionary but they manufacture and supply all the bulk materials for there product. So once a company buys their 3D printers they almost have to buy the consumables from NNDM. 2/3 of their revenue comes from the printer itself while the other 1/3 comes from support/consumables. 

They are buying up smaller nano printing companies and have secured almost all the competitive patents. One article said the next competition is 2-3 years behind NNDM 

What are the downsides? 

NNDM has been underperforming over the last year or so in its transition to mass market vendor. They are also struggling to gain a foothold in the PCB market right now. 

It’s also been a rollercoaster of a stock, I have seen massive gains and subsequent losses all with in a few months of each other. 

Conclusion 

This is not a stock to buy if you’re expecting instant gains with in a week or so. You invest in this company if you like the potential in their technology. I believe the stock right now at $7 a share is a steal because if they can optimize production for mass market I believe their stock could be $30+ in a few years. 

Also the short volume ratio is sitting at 27% which is higher than AMC’s 23%.",nnqo52,Potential of Nano Dimension $NNDM

The above link is what I said 2 days ago. At the time EXPI was hovering around $28.50 and since then it has shot up to about $32.27 on what appears to be about average volume for the stock. 

I still think they are going to have a huge share buyback of over 14m shares (their buyback program was increased from 75m to 475m) in stock and add to the insider owned shares which is now at 54.80% over the week it has gone up about 2%. Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity. Also the buyback would be large enough to trigger a massive buy and I would jizz my pants.",nmnbfw,*UPDATE* Why I still Think EXPI Is Going To $60 In 4-6 Weeks (up 10.59% this week)

This text was originally posted in r/[Mauerstrassenwetten](https://www.reddit.com/r/mauerstrassenwetten/comments/laaq9y/an_alle_zuh%C3%B6ren_und_schnauze_halten/) by u/knutolee. I thought his message was so powerful that I asked him for permission to translate, post (can share chat with Mod if required or check directly with him) and fuck his wife (ok didn’t ask for permission) after and he agreed to ~~all~~ most of this wholeheartedly – like a true Autist. I am trying to catch the message – so don’t expect a word by word translation as you can never catch the greatness of the text in it’s entirety and I got to translate it in a way that even a US degenerate can follow it.

As usual no financial advice, I more or less just copied the text because I liked the text and I like the share. In general I have likely lost more than I won and the stock market is a mystery in itself to me. So make your own due dilligence and don’t trust financial advice of others (the argument for that you can read to a certain extent below).

**Autists, Degenerates, Idiocracy of the World – let me get this straight!**

In the coming days I don’t wanna see all this whining and bitching on this sub and espescially in the daily GME threads anymore. On every fucking corner of this sub I smell doubt, you read messages the likes of „this is over“, „we missed the squeeze“, „I am going to loose it all“, „entered at 320$ - I am doomed“. What the fuck is wrong with you retards, did you fucking wanker your wifes boyfriend dick all night and lost your mind over the effort to do so? I think I got to get this accross the Buddy Stephens way to get you down to fucking earth and get your attitude right.

**1) You come to a sub called** r/wallstreetbets **and yolo your hard earned money in $GME**

You realize what you are doing here - you true fuck - dont you? This is a community of full blown first class true tits up degenerates which take pleasure in posting losses accumulating into the millions every fucking month and you are putting your money into a BET – yes my dear it is written out in the name of this very fucking sub Wallstreet-B-E-T-S!!! – and follow DD posted by people with names like „SHOW\_ME\_YOUR\_ANAL\_TITS“? You realize this is not a fucking Disney ferry „One-Wish-comes-true“ show and we see all day long gain porn and loss porn is something which doesn’t exist in this world? This is a band of true autists which occupied an absolute niche when it comes down to trading (and we even don’t trade stocks normally!). This is the place where one wants to enjoy the sado-masochistic part of the retarded capitalistic system we are living in. Yes we have some (maybe a lot) DD diamonds in this sub which by the way are now impossible to find because you degenerate fucks spam the entire system to the moon but no sane long-term investor would consider to invest into any of these investments – this is about „get rich or die trying!“. This is not r/investing!

**2) Yeah but I saw Reddit in the news and all that stuff about GME and it was going through the roof becasue there is going to be short squeeze and on top of it the hedge funds fucked up, hihihi**

If this entire thing was a safe bet why exactly would not the fucking entire world jump on this train? (and even you might get this image from all this „Saudi Arabia calling, China calling, Africa calling posts – but please they invest into BABA, Aramco or I don’t know what’s the hot shit in Lagos stock exchange right now – could be though the next big thing – got to see if I can find a DD on this). So why is this not happening? Because it is a fucking BET – the stock market is a fucking Casino and the major difference between r/investing and us is that they are always just bet on black or red, while we always go for the magical zero. It is totally unclear whether all of us going to show up at Miami Beach with our Porsche Cayenne or Tesla Model S and hit on the girls (or boys) on the beach! The reasons are layed out to you every fucking day with yet another quality DD that most of us simply dont understand! And yes our chances to already sit on the fucking moon slurping our Pinha Coladas would be certainly higher if everything was going the way we believe the system should be working but even the last person who joined this sub by now should realize – you are potentially fucking with the system itself (by the way something this sub never intentionally wanted and you shouldn’t do if you like the system).

**3) Hey but when is the squeeze of the squoze going to happen? 😓**

So there is this story going through the media and from Florida to Colorado everybody remotely degenerate is yoloing money into GME. It’s a fucking global movement now (or not – could be also the same 50.000 degenerates cheering up themselves the entire time which would much better fit this place) and according to the DD we just need to have 🙌💎and the shorts a bleeding their panties, their balls feel squozen (and not in a good way) and they are completely in defensive mode. What do you think what people who are responsible for Multi-billion $$$ HF are going to do? How do you think you become a person who is responsible for such an operation? Do you think these guys have served as altar boys or girls in church (no offense if so)? What is wrong with you? Seriously! Do you think if they get some headwind they are going to say: Oh boy – we got defeated and going to realize a multi-fucking-billion-to-the-moon loss? **OF COURSE FUCKING NOT!** **THEY WILL GET EVERY FUCKING BAZOOKA, TANK, ROCKET or INTER-STELLAR DEFENSE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BRING THIS TO AN END!** Influence the market participants (speculation), Short-Laddar attacks (I to this very day haven’t understand the concept or how this works – speculation), demotivational tactics (speculation) and to whomever picks it up – desinformation (well not quite speculation but it could also be that media is just retarded as fuck to get the most simple facts straight). So what would you do with a potential group of 5mn small-size investors – shall we do a collective effort to think about it? Ah fuck it! It is to fucking obvious – you would dry this out through time, divide their interests and drive away their attention. Because let’s be fucking honest – most of you entered this thinking you would hold this wonderful stock for a couple of days (and to be honest in this respect the community how it existed 10 days ago was much more true to itself - no whining just sayin)! Gotcha! Who can tell me who fucked each other two weeks ago in People magazin or on Twitter? Nobody – I even don’t remember shit about this very forum before GME (ok I remember u/variation-separate but that is another story). And all their tactics are completely understandable because there is a fucking huge amount of tendies to be made and they are not that different from us (my fear).

**4) That does not give you the fucking right to whine and bitch all the time in the daily threads (and it is not happening already its going to be) and fucking ruin the party**

Deal with it – we just got to wait how this thing plays out. That’s it. If we are right – this will play out positively in one or another way (huge tendies or SEC investigating). Let them continue shorting the stock or whatever. If you believe you want to buy more stock – do your DD and do it. When this got picked up a long time ago by people they thought – hmmmm makes sense – I am going to get me one of these tickets to the moon. There was if at all a very little interest to squoze the balls of any HF and it was certainly not the main motivation of this sub. I said it above: Get rich or die tryin! Since last Thursday the whole thing became political and it looks like rules were changed in our disfavour and yeah we can not go back in time but we got to deal with it and the circumstances. \[Left out this part as it promotes holding and buying which I don’t want to in the sense that everybody needs to make his own fucking decision but I am going to fucking hold\] but **WE NEED TO REGAIN OUR POSITIVE SPIRIT** which was an essential part of this sub and GME for most part in January (and of course in general before) – no matter how fucked up things looked (individually as there is not such a thing as collective alignment to buy options or stocks on this forum). We will see how the numbers are play out and who provided the adequate picture. In our reality GME is going to the moon and the 🚀 is fueled. Period. We are just prevented from starting because of the windy conditions out there.

So please – no post without 🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🚀🚀🚀 and if you want to fukn leave the party – leave – but let us continue this party, because we are going to the fkn moon. This is the way and I fkn love GME and if this means I need to hold onto this beauty for another 25 years I am going to do it.

P.S.: One thing dear to my heart - in the past there has been huge donations made by this community to people living with autism. As we use their names every fkn day I would really like to see some of your degenerates not to forget about this cause because we owe them and as much as I like the billboards I’d rather see every $$$ go into charities rather then telling the world about us  – I think everybody out there knows by now that we exist and that we have 🙌💎 

Edit: Nobody asked for it but 35@231,69 and thanks for the awards which should go to u/knutolee \- so you can simply award his original post referenced. More importantly he expressed to me that he is very happy with the translation which is almost as important as the message itself.

Edit 2: Please pay attention to AMA Marc Cuban - [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey\_everyone\_its\_mark\_cuban\_jumping\_on\_to\_do\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/) \- there is I think some quite enlighting answers in a very easy to understand language.

Edit 3: Bought 5@103 

Edit 4: Heading for dinner. Crazy times. Will check later and decide whether to buy more tickets or not. But maybe good advice for some others to make a break. Chillax :)

Edit 5: Read that RH has opened up GME again. For whatever it's worth 🚀

Edit 6: Thanks again for all the Awards and stuff. I can only reload in the morning. Was fun and maybe I am going to translate more in the future - if mods would consider to give me a copy cat 😺 flair it would be the icing on the cake.

Edit 7: Obligatory salute to the one and only DFV and his 💎 balls. This guy will go all the way to the 🚀 with us.",nnqvu1,To all GME holders: Shut up and listen

That is the whole 'quantum physics thing'.

However, all that shit goes out the window the moment someone observes the cat, because either the cat is very alive or very dead.  This is the whole 'classical physics thing'.

There is a point at which quantum physics becomes irrelevant because classical phyics (observing the state of something) gives one all the info they need to know, and Schroedinger's Cat just raises the question, ""where is the precise point at which we should disregard quantum physics in favor of the more mundane stuff?""

**Autists, Degenerates, Idiocracy of the World – let me get this straight!**

In the coming days I don’t wanna see all this whining and bitching on this sub and espescially in the daily GME threads anymore. On every fucking corner of this sub I smell doubt, you read messages the likes of „this is over“, „we missed the squeeze“, „I am going to loose it all“, „entered at 320$ - I am doomed“. What the fuck is wrong with you retards, did you fucking wanker your wifes boyfriend dick all night and lost your mind over the effort to do so? I think I got to get this accross the Buddy Stephens way to get you down to fucking earth and get your attitude right.

**1) You come to a sub called** r/wallstreetbets **and yolo your hard earned money in $GME**

You realize what you are doing here - you true fuck - dont you? This is a community of full blown first class true tits up degenerates which take pleasure in posting losses accumulating into the millions every fucking month and you are putting your money into a BET – yes my dear it is written out in the name of this very fucking sub Wallstreet-B-E-T-S!!! – and follow DD posted by people with names like „SHOW\_ME\_YOUR\_ANAL\_TITS“? You realize this is not a fucking Disney ferry „One-Wish-comes-true“ show and we see all day long gain porn and loss porn is something which doesn’t exist in this world? This is a band of true autists which occupied an absolute niche when it comes down to trading (and we even don’t trade stocks normally!). This is the place where one wants to enjoy the sado-masochistic part of the retarded capitalistic system we are living in. Yes we have some (maybe a lot) DD diamonds in this sub which by the way are now impossible to find because you degenerate fucks spam the entire system to the moon but no sane long-term investor would consider to invest into any of these investments – this is about „get rich or die trying!“. This is not r/investing!

**2) Yeah but I saw Reddit in the news and all that stuff about GME and it was going through the roof becasue there is going to be short squeeze and on top of it the hedge funds fucked up, hihihi**

If this entire thing was a safe bet why exactly would not the fucking entire world jump on this train? (and even you might get this image from all this „Saudi Arabia calling, China calling, Africa calling posts – but please they invest into BABA, Aramco or I don’t know what’s the hot shit in Lagos stock exchange right now – could be though the next big thing – got to see if I can find a DD on this). So why is this not happening? Because it is a fucking BET – the stock market is a fucking Casino and the major difference between r/investing and us is that they are always just bet on black or red, while we always go for the magical zero. It is totally unclear whether all of us going to show up at Miami Beach with our Porsche Cayenne or Tesla Model S and hit on the girls (or boys) on the beach! The reasons are layed out to you every fucking day with yet another quality DD that most of us simply dont understand! And yes our chances to already sit on the fucking moon slurping our Pinha Coladas would be certainly higher if everything was going the way we believe the system should be working but even the last person who joined this sub by now should realize – you are potentially fucking with the system itself (by the way something this sub never intentionally wanted and you shouldn’t do if you like the system).

**3) Hey but when is the squeeze of the squoze going to happen? 😓**

So there is this story going through the media and from Florida to Colorado everybody remotely degenerate is yoloing money into GME. It’s a fucking global movement now (or not – could be also the same 50.000 degenerates cheering up themselves the entire time which would much better fit this place) and according to the DD we just need to have 🙌💎and the shorts a bleeding their panties, their balls feel squozen (and not in a good way) and they are completely in defensive mode. What do you think what people who are responsible for Multi-billion $$$ HF are going to do? How do you think you become a person who is responsible for such an operation? Do you think these guys have served as altar boys or girls in church (no offense if so)? What is wrong with you? Seriously! Do you think if they get some headwind they are going to say: Oh boy – we got defeated and going to realize a multi-fucking-billion-to-the-moon loss? **OF COURSE FUCKING NOT!** **THEY WILL GET EVERY FUCKING BAZOOKA, TANK, ROCKET or INTER-STELLAR DEFENSE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BRING THIS TO AN END!** Influence the market participants (speculation), Short-Laddar attacks (I to this very day haven’t understand the concept or how this works – speculation), demotivational tactics (speculation) and to whomever picks it up – desinformation (well not quite speculation but it could also be that media is just retarded as fuck to get the most simple facts straight). So what would you do with a potential group of 5mn small-size investors – shall we do a collective effort to think about it? Ah fuck it! It is to fucking obvious – you would dry this out through time, divide their interests and drive away their attention. Because let’s be fucking honest – most of you entered this thinking you would hold this wonderful stock for a couple of days (and to be honest in this respect the community how it existed 10 days ago was much more true to itself - no whining just sayin)! Gotcha! Who can tell me who fucked each other two weeks ago in People magazin or on Twitter? Nobody – I even don’t remember shit about this very forum before GME (ok I remember u/variation-separate but that is another story). And all their tactics are completely understandable because there is a fucking huge amount of tendies to be made and they are not that different from us (my fear).

**4) That does not give you the fucking right to whine and bitch all the time in the daily threads (and it is not happening already its going to be) and fucking ruin the party**

Deal with it – we just got to wait how this thing plays out. That’s it. If we are right – this will play out positively in one or another way (huge tendies or SEC investigating). Let them continue shorting the stock or whatever. If you believe you want to buy more stock – do your DD and do it. When this got picked up a long time ago by people they thought – hmmmm makes sense – I am going to get me one of these tickets to the moon. There was if at all a very little interest to squoze the balls of any HF and it was certainly not the main motivation of this sub. I said it above: Get rich or die tryin! Since last Thursday the whole thing became political and it looks like rules were changed in our disfavour and yeah we can not go back in time but we got to deal with it and the circumstances. \[Left out this part as it promotes holding and buying which I don’t want to in the sense that everybody needs to make his own fucking decision but I am going to fucking hold\] but **WE NEED TO REGAIN OUR POSITIVE SPIRIT** which was an essential part of this sub and GME for most part in January (and of course in general before) – no matter how fucked up things looked (individually as there is not such a thing as collective alignment to buy options or stocks on this forum). We will see how the numbers are play out and who provided the adequate picture. In our reality GME is going to the moon and the 🚀 is fueled. Period. We are just prevented from starting because of the windy conditions out there.

So please – no post without 🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🚀🚀🚀 and if you want to fukn leave the party – leave – but let us continue this party, because we are going to the fkn moon. This is the way and I fkn love GME and if this means I need to hold onto this beauty for another 25 years I am going to do it.

P.S.: One thing dear to my heart - in the past there has been huge donations made by this community to people living with autism. As we use their names every fkn day I would really like to see some of your degenerates not to forget about this cause because we owe them and as much as I like the billboards I’d rather see every $$$ go into charities rather then telling the world about us  – I think everybody out there knows by now that we exist and that we have 🙌💎 

Edit: Nobody asked for it but 35@231,69 and thanks for the awards which should go to u/knutolee \- so you can simply award his original post referenced. More importantly he expressed to me that he is very happy with the translation which is almost as important as the message itself.

Edit 2: Please pay attention to AMA Marc Cuban - [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey\_everyone\_its\_mark\_cuban\_jumping\_on\_to\_do\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/) \- there is I think some quite enlighting answers in a very easy to understand language.

Edit 3: Bought 5@103 

Edit 4: Heading for dinner. Crazy times. Will check later and decide whether to buy more tickets or not. But maybe good advice for some others to make a break. Chillax :)

Edit 5: Read that RH has opened up GME again. For whatever it's worth 🚀

Edit 6: Thanks again for all the Awards and stuff. I can only reload in the morning. Was fun and maybe I am going to translate more in the future - if mods would consider to give me a copy cat 😺 flair it would be the icing on the cake.

Edit 7: Obligatory salute to the one and only DFV and his 💎 balls. This guy will go all the way to the 🚀 with us.",nnqydh,To all GME holders: Shut up and listen
