This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG‚Äôs Graphene and UQ‚Äôs patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

**What I'm doing**: Averaging in slowly in preparation for the 10D EMA to come in in preparation for another leg higher.

Market

* **The RPA Market is growing rapidly**: GVR estimates the global robotic process automation market to grow at 34% CAGR through 2028 while Gartner estimates it to grow at over 24% YoY CAGR - to $600B, through 2022 ([source](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-28-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-hyperautomation-enabling-software-market-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-by-2022)) and expects $PATH to grow at 33% CAGR ([source](https://www.uipath.com/resources/automation-analyst-reports/gartner-magic-quadrant-robotic-process-automation))
* **$PATH dominates the most important regions for RPA**: North America (accounts for 37% of global RPA spend ([source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/robotic-process-automation-rpa-market)) and as of January¬†31, 2021, $PATH had 7,968¬†customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 63% of the Fortune Global 500 ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_9))

Company & Financials

* **$PATH can expect high levels of current customer retention**: UiPath has an NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 71 over the past 12 mo period, lightyears beyond the industry average of 39 ([Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_4), [Source](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/))
* **Strong revenue growth:** $PATH is experiencing YoY Revenue growth of over 80%
* **Strong profitability growth:** While $PATH grows revenues at over 80% YoY, their cost of revenue only grows at \~13% YoY. EBITDA Margin is growing at 88% YoY - $PATH will begin capturing large profits in the next year ([source](https://app.koyfin.com/fa/fa.is/eq-08u9m6))

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG‚Äôs Graphene and UQ‚Äôs patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

**What I'm doing**: Averaging in slowly in preparation for the 10D EMA to come in in preparation for another leg higher.

Market

* **The RPA Market is growing rapidly**: GVR estimates the global robotic process automation market to grow at 34% CAGR through 2028 while Gartner estimates it to grow at over 24% YoY CAGR - to $600B, through 2022 ([source](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-28-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-hyperautomation-enabling-software-market-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-by-2022)) and expects $PATH to grow at 33% CAGR ([source](https://www.uipath.com/resources/automation-analyst-reports/gartner-magic-quadrant-robotic-process-automation))
* **$PATH dominates the most important regions for RPA**: North America (accounts for 37% of global RPA spend ([source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/robotic-process-automation-rpa-market)) and as of January¬†31, 2021, $PATH had 7,968¬†customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 63% of the Fortune Global 500 ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_9))

Company & Financials

* **$PATH can expect high levels of current customer retention**: UiPath has an NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 71 over the past 12 mo period, lightyears beyond the industry average of 39 ([Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_4), [Source](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/))
* **Strong revenue growth:** $PATH is experiencing YoY Revenue growth of over 80%
* **Strong profitability growth:** While $PATH grows revenues at over 80% YoY, their cost of revenue only grows at \~13% YoY. EBITDA Margin is growing at 88% YoY - $PATH will begin capturing large profits in the next year ([source](https://app.koyfin.com/fa/fa.is/eq-08u9m6))

TA & Entry

* $PATH has consolidated off it's IPO highs
* $PATH has tested these highs multiple times and is forming a nice support
* Traders are waiting for 10D EMA to catch up before accepting another run

Shorting is a normal and regular aspect of natural stock growth. **Regular** shorting does not lead to false news. It is a trader taking advantage of normal price movement.  Your don't need to be proficient at manipulation to benefit from **REGULAR** shorting. 

Consider this, If you banned all forms of shorting, how would you expect to make money in a bear market?  How do you think fund managers continued to provide investment returns during Sept200-Mar2003 when *EVERYTHING** got cut a little over half?  How about Nov2007-Mar2009 that basically reset (100% gone) **EVERYTHING** back to the last haircut of Mar2003?  Longs lost six (6) years over an 18mo. period.

You want to throw the short-baby out with the market-bathwater.  Because you don't understand it's role in the market lifecycle. The problem **IS NOT** with the mechanism, it's with the regulators being lax on enforcement and permissive with regulation. It's with hedgefucks playing fast and loose with regulations and developing techniques that skirt the spirit (if not the letter) of regulations.

The solution: tighten regulations to eliminate abuse (i.e., hard borrow requirement, not just locate available), increase reporting requirements, and stiffen penalties (make violations unprofitable.)",,

The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

**What I'm doing**: Averaging in slowly in preparation for the 10D EMA to come in in preparation for another leg higher.

Market

* **The RPA Market is growing rapidly**: GVR estimates the global robotic process automation market to grow at 34% CAGR through 2028 while Gartner estimates it to grow at over 24% YoY CAGR - to $600B, through 2022 ([source](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-28-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-hyperautomation-enabling-software-market-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-by-2022)) and expects $PATH to grow at 33% CAGR ([source](https://www.uipath.com/resources/automation-analyst-reports/gartner-magic-quadrant-robotic-process-automation))
* **$PATH dominates the most important regions for RPA**: North America (accounts for 37% of global RPA spend ([source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/robotic-process-automation-rpa-market)) and as of January¬†31, 2021, $PATH had 7,968¬†customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 63% of the Fortune Global 500 ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_9))

Company & Financials

* **$PATH can expect high levels of current customer retention**: UiPath has an NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 71 over the past 12 mo period, lightyears beyond the industry average of 39 ([Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_4), [Source](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/))
* **Strong revenue growth:** $PATH is experiencing YoY Revenue growth of over 80%
* **Strong profitability growth:** While $PATH grows revenues at over 80% YoY, their cost of revenue only grows at \~13% YoY. EBITDA Margin is growing at 88% YoY - $PATH will begin capturing large profits in the next year ([source](https://app.koyfin.com/fa/fa.is/eq-08u9m6))

TA & Entry

* $PATH has consolidated off it's IPO highs

Sup, WSB folks!

It‚Äôs Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I‚Äôm the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we‚Äôll take a look at the superior stonk‚Äòs current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‚Äòs fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF‚Äôs GF‚Äôs ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to üêª in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day!

These aren't even the real squeezes, they have only just begun. Keep buying more AMC & GME guys. Mark my words, GME is going to minimum $800 and AMC is going to minimum $250.

After reaching those prices, if most diamond hands still hold, the squeezes will go even higher. Because the hedgies never covered all their shorts back in January. They were hoping to scare off most retail traders and crash the stock prices.

Do you guys remember the stockmarket mini-crash before the AMC+GME short squeezes happened in January? That time the hedgies sold out stocks to liquidate billions to cover their short positions. But they couldn't cover all the shorts, thats when they bribed Robinhood and other trading platforms to suspend trading etc.

Similarly, The recent crypto market crash was actually caused by hedgefunds liquidating billions of dollars to prepare covering their shorts, not because of Chinese regulators cracking down on Cryptos. Chinese govt have banned purchasing of cryptos all the way back in 2017. Its nothing new. The hedgies reached the limit to keep manipulating the AMC+GME stock prices and eventually they had to face the reality, especially after AMC cancelling their proposed stock dilution with 500 Million new stocks. Hedgies are basically f*cked at this stage and are absolutely desperate to close their short positions.

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG‚Äôs Graphene and UQ‚Äôs patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

These aren't even the real squeezes, they have only just begun. Keep buying more AMC & GME guys. Mark my words, GME is going to minimum $800 and AMC is going to minimum $250.

After reaching those prices, if most diamond hands still hold, the squeezes will go even higher. Because the hedgies never covered all their shorts back in January. They were hoping to scare off most retail traders and crash the stock prices.

Do you guys remember the stockmarket mini-crash before the AMC+GME short squeezes happened in January? That time the hedgies sold out stocks to liquidate billions to cover their short positions. But they couldn't cover all the shorts, thats when they bribed Robinhood and other trading platforms to suspend trading etc.

Similarly, The recent crypto market crash was actually caused by hedgefunds liquidating billions of dollars to prepare covering their shorts, not because of Chinese regulators cracking down on Cryptos. Chinese govt have banned purchasing of cryptos all the way back in 2017. Its nothing new. The hedgies reached the limit to keep manipulating the AMC+GME stock prices and eventually they had to face the reality, especially after AMC cancelling their proposed stock dilution with 500 Million new stocks. Hedgies are basically f*cked at this stage and are absolutely desperate to close their short positions.

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG‚Äôs Graphene and UQ‚Äôs patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

1241,,2021-05-26 16:16:05,t3_nlktes,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR - Great market growth, awesome fundamentals, great product & retention, exciting TA set up.

**What I'm doing**: Averaging in slowly in preparation for the 10D EMA to come in in preparation for another leg higher.

Market

* **The RPA Market is growing rapidly**: GVR estimates the global robotic process automation market to grow at 34% CAGR through 2028 while Gartner estimates it to grow at over 24% YoY CAGR - to $600B, through 2022 ([source](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-28-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-hyperautomation-enabling-software-market-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-by-2022)) and expects $PATH to grow at 33% CAGR ([source](https://www.uipath.com/resources/automation-analyst-reports/gartner-magic-quadrant-robotic-process-automation))
* **$PATH dominates the most important regions for RPA**: North America (accounts for 37% of global RPA spend ([source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/robotic-process-automation-rpa-market)) and as of January¬†31, 2021, $PATH had 7,968¬†customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 63% of the Fortune Global 500 ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_9))

Company & Financials

* **$PATH can expect high levels of current customer retention**: UiPath has an NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 71 over the past 12 mo period, lightyears beyond the industry average of 39 ([Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_4), [Source](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/))
* **Strong revenue growth:** $PATH is experiencing YoY Revenue growth of over 80%
* **Strong profitability growth:** While $PATH grows revenues at over 80% YoY, their cost of revenue only grows at \~13% YoY. EBITDA Margin is growing at 88% YoY - $PATH will begin capturing large profits in the next year ([source](https://app.koyfin.com/fa/fa.is/eq-08u9m6))

TA & Entry

* $PATH has consolidated off it's IPO highs
* $PATH has tested these highs multiple times and is forming a nice support
* Traders are waiting for 10D EMA to catch up before accepting another run

But think about it, what if this is a ploy?
What if they are the ones driving it up getting a lot of people who hold the shares to start buying calls and shares. And they will start another attack to bring it down again. When it‚Äôs down the profit is booked.

The highest open interest is at 300 and I‚Äôm sure people are buying these calls. The number doubled just as I was typing this post!",nll1q4,Could it be possible that they are simulating a squeeze to get people to buy higher and then they will drop it like a potato again?

The problem it's solving is that each car is almost like a different operating system, Tesla = macOS, Mercedes = Windows, BMW = Linux.

The current maximum tax credit is $7,500 with no maximum price and currently phases out for individual automakers once they hit 200,000 total EVs sold.

Both General Motors and Tesla have hit the cap and currently do not qualify for the $7,500 tax credit.

The ‚ÄúClean Energy for America‚Äù bill, which advanced on a 14-14 tie vote, would eliminate the existing EV cap, while the credit would phase-out over three years once 50% of U.S. passenger vehicle sales were EVs. It has numerous other green energy tax incentives and would rescind or cut many fossil fuel tax provisions.

The EV proposal led by Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, would boost the $7,500 tax credit by $2,500 for vehicles assembled in the United States and another $2,500 for cars at facilities whose production workers are members of, or represented by, a labor union.

That would mean smaller credits to automakers such as Tesla, Volkswagen and others who do not have U.S. union workers, and companies building EVs outside the United States.‚Äù

1502,,2021-05-27 09:14:36,t3_nm3fhq,,wallstreetbets,"Currently, I've been looking at Duty-Free International TICKER: 5SO

There are a few things I saw that grabbed my attention. The chain store is well known in Asia for selling things far cheaper than others especially in areas such as airports. The price of the stock is currently sitting at $0.082, a huge drop from when it was public at $2 a share.

The company currently holds cash and cash equivalents at $49.5M and has 1.2B shares outstanding. That translates into $0.04125 of cash per share.

The price of the company then will be $0.082 - $0.04125 = $0.04075 per share.

The current asset of the company is $82.3M or $0.0685 per share basis.

This results in the ""Cash + Liquid Assets"" of the company being $0.10983

Not to mention the company barely have any debt. ( Too small to be significant)

That is more than the price per share of the stock.

The dividend yield has been the following: [https://www.dividends.sg/view/5SO](https://www.dividends.sg/view/5SO)

From the 10 years its been paying dividends, it averaged 25.914% a year.

I personally think that this is an investment that meets the criteria for a good return.

&#x200B;

Now, why haven't the professionals picked up on this? 

The fact is that they cant. With a Market Cap of merely $102M, even if a $1B hedge fund bought the whole company, it is only worth 10% of the portfolio. not to mention most funds are significantly larger than that. By definition, it is just short of making it into the Small Cap Category since the market cap is counted by ""Price of share x Shares outstanding"". I believe that as the Covid Situation eventually gets better, this store is going to pick up sales again and grow rather significantly. - That being the Bull Case.

In the bear case, if the company fails to pick up business and goes bankrupt, the current ratio of 6x means that for every dollar you put into the company, you can get back $6 in assets as Liquidation Payout.

The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

Sup, WSB folks!

It‚Äôs Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I‚Äôm the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we‚Äôll take a look at the superior stonk‚Äòs current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‚Äòs fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF‚Äôs GF‚Äôs ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to üêª in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day!

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices.

1550,,2021-05-26 17:48:02,t3_nlmzdx,,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

1551,,2021-05-26 18:08:33,t3_nlnghi,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

**Shorting $GLD**

$GLD mostly follows real rates and then the $. 

What has allowed $GLD to prosper recently has been :

a) Ever dovish FED decreasing nominal rates as much as they can via their speeches & slower than expected job gains which have cemented FED forecasts

b) Ever rising inflation expectations due to faulty base effects that are transitory

c) Some impact from Crapto crash with money flowing back into $GLD (some of it at least :/)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I think there has been a gestalt shift on all three items 

a) FED's Clarida & Quarles yesterday have both suggested the beginning of tapering discussions 

> Late yesterday, the Fed‚Äôs Quarles said ‚Äúit will become important for the FOMC to begin discussing our plans to adjust the pace of asset purchases at upcoming meetings.‚Äù Quarles is the Fed‚Äôs Vice Chair for Supervision and it is unusual for him to comment on monetary policy. 

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-27/gold-slips-from-four-month-high-as-central-banks-views-in-focus](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-27/gold-slips-from-four-month-high-as-central-banks-views-in-focus)

aBis) The NFP last month was a serious miss but it's not gonna be repeated : as schools reopen and UIs are not extended in a lot of states, the slaves will go back to finding a slave master before jobs run out. employers have also adjusted somewhat with regards to wage expectations already which should make for a much more balanced jobs market going into the begining of school season

b) Inflation (in CPI sense) has peaked in April or will peak now, Commos have crashed thanks to our lords and saviors, the ccp tightening margins and putting an end to this story. 

c) Crapto stabilized

**All of this points to higher real rates which are really at the bottom of what they could ever be thus we have to sell $GLD**",nm3kt9,Time to : Short $GLD | GC 1850$ August put

I know that you are a bunch of inbred retards like myself. And I present to you the most autistic and lowkey genius play out there,

***GamesWorkshop***

**What are they doing?**

GamesWorkshop produce little plastic toys for grown ups with too much money and no dating life. You know the Warhammer 40k and Warhammer Fantasy IP? Thats what they do. They created that stuff. They sit on one if the most popular franchises that is gettint A LOT of attention these days. 

**Why should you care?**

GamesWorkshop is a pretty old company. And it sucked major balls for decades. 

The stock rose 62,9% during the last 12 months. Why should we care now? 

BECAUSE NOW IS THE TIME TO BELIEVE 

Reasons why I¬¥m EXTREMELY BULLISH:

\- the IP¬¥s are gaining traction. Fast. There are so many games comming out theses days that focus on the Warhammer universe, it¬¥s actually insane. If just a fraction of the people playing decide to buy some of these overpriced plastic models GamesWorkshop is making BANK. 

\- The (realtively) new CEO ""gets"" it. His predecessor was a dumb boomer fuck who would not open their IPs for anything besides their own models. But the new guy plays the new media game like a damn fiddle. Since he is in charge the company is running so fucking smooth, it¬¥s insane. They will revive Warhammer Fantasy again (was canceled because of bad management), they plan to produce movies, TV series, they opened a second plant to produce their modells, great games with their IP get released more and more, they are more present on social media, they produce new modells that kick ass, the new IP (Age of Sigmar) that replaced Fantasy actually is great now etc....

With the release of their 9th Warhammer 40k Edition they also released a special starter box (dont worry about the details, you will get the jest in a second). You could preorder it. Because they knew that there was a lot of nerds who wanted to get one of these boxes they produced more of these boxes than of any box previous. Guess what?

It was sold out in 17 minutes. Thats it. The nerds out there are fucking addicted and they want that shit more than crystal meth. And the train is just gaining speed.

Every quarter they blow their earnings report out of the water.

Corona? Made them stronger. Brexit? Didn¬¥t matter.

This company is the equivalent of the ugly nerd in highschool that got jacked and fucks your wife when he is in college. 

Get in there. This thing will blow up. 

The Emperor protects.

- BB attempted this transition to Cyber Security years ago, again nothing new about it. I use their software on a daily basis and it is shit and clunky. Cisco easily outmatches it. BB is the budget ""because we need it for compliance"" software.

- IVY is a heavily overstated platform. Nobody cares about half of the data it collects. Vehicle manufactures can easily collect this data for themselves if it was useful. The physics of driving is a pretty straightforward concept.

I assure you, this ISN'T going to get political. Because by all accounts South Africa is screwed. My planned position is bottom paragraph.
Under the current ANC government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of South Africa. Due to systemic nepotism, there are math teachers that don't know what square roots are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The ANC solved this, against advise of wiser people, with quantitative easing. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the South African Rand which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years.
That is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison guard dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as car keys and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated tap water comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). South Africans are more likely to have their asylum applications accepted than any other nation as there are so many tales of rape and murder and threats of ethnic cleansing. This equates to the most educated citizens leaving SA and most SA based businesses diversifying out of the country as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Afrikaner in history Elon Musk who is now a naturalized American.
Edit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock.
I first thought about shorting South Africa over a year ago when I was researching the country (I'm a historian, I read much on the country for fun). I found the only index tracking SA (EZA) wasn't an accurate representation of SA economy and buying puts on it was useless. It tracked only the largest cap firms, which are the aforementioned companies diversifying out of SA (mostly to other parts of Africa). Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on SA going full Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems.
My new broker, IBKR, allows negative currency positions as long you post 10% as collateral. Now my native currency are US dollars, where inflation in 2020 was 1.4% while the South African Rand's inflation was 4.12% in 2020. That equals a 26.8% return on investment per year from that simple short position. But I'm expecting US Dollar inflation to stay between 1-2% a year while the Rand (ticker ZAR) stays north of 4% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade. This position also reduces my market beta, much needed for me as I've got hugely leveraged positions on American ETFs. This isn't a short term swing trade, I'm waiting for SA to implode.",nm3o2l,I am going to short the whole country of South Africa.

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG‚Äôs Graphene and UQ‚Äôs patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

**What I'm doing**: Averaging in slowly in preparation for the 10D EMA to come in in preparation for another leg higher.

Market

* **The RPA Market is growing rapidly**: GVR estimates the global robotic process automation market to grow at 34% CAGR through 2028 while Gartner estimates it to grow at over 24% YoY CAGR - to $600B, through 2022 ([source](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-28-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-hyperautomation-enabling-software-market-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-by-2022)) and expects $PATH to grow at 33% CAGR ([source](https://www.uipath.com/resources/automation-analyst-reports/gartner-magic-quadrant-robotic-process-automation))
* **$PATH dominates the most important regions for RPA**: North America (accounts for 37% of global RPA spend ([source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/robotic-process-automation-rpa-market)) and as of January¬†31, 2021, $PATH had 7,968¬†customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 63% of the Fortune Global 500 ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_9))

Company & Financials

* **$PATH can expect high levels of current customer retention**: UiPath has an NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 71 over the past 12 mo period, lightyears beyond the industry average of 39 ([Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_4), [Source](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/))
* **Strong revenue growth:** $PATH is experiencing YoY Revenue growth of over 80%
* **Strong profitability growth:** While $PATH grows revenues at over 80% YoY, their cost of revenue only grows at \~13% YoY. EBITDA Margin is growing at 88% YoY - $PATH will begin capturing large profits in the next year ([source](https://app.koyfin.com/fa/fa.is/eq-08u9m6))

Sup, WSB folks!

It‚Äôs Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I‚Äôm the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we‚Äôll take a look at the superior stonk‚Äòs current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‚Äòs fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF‚Äôs GF‚Äôs ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to üêª in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day!

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices. I know many people who want to travel but few who want to buy stock.**",nlmxyt,How to profit from the final stages of Coronavirus

1926,,2021-05-26 17:48:02,t3_nlmzdx,,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

1927,,2021-05-26 18:08:33,t3_nlnghi,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

https://preview.redd.it/s6s8qwy39i171.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7d910feb79393f4fe0de5fad54e89f5bead4c39

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

[https://rss.knf.gov.pl/RssOuterView/faces/start2OuterView.xhtml](https://rss.knf.gov.pl/RssOuterView/faces/start2OuterView.xhtml) \-> head to current positions  


Do you think it is possible that because of that many shorts, a short squeeze like in late january is likely to occure?   
another of my thoughts was, do you think it might be possible that those short sellers are using bots and other ways to manipulate the opinion of the people and the ratings of their new game cyberpunk2077, to make them even worse than they already are?  
like ""spilling gas into the open fire"", to make people hate the company even more and by that making investors panic and sell - and they profit because of their shorts.   


I just wondered, cause everytime i see a post about cd projekt red on twitter lately, the haters will be much faster to comment than the actual fans, what means either there are people who actually intend to spread negativity regarding this company - to make profit - or these people are actually haters who, unknowingly, make short sellers (including even citadel in this case) earn big money.   


To be clear: Of course CD PROJEKT is to be criticized for their actions, and the drop of their stock price might be well deserved. But I hate to think that, the people who profit from that are even much worse than them and that people who claim to hate the bad ""corpos"" and therefore now hate CD PROJEKT, are helping even worse corpos and dont even know that they do

you didn't but you should because you did that thing where you act like only direct inheritance counts, you fucking clown. it's access to capital, social or direct, that vastly improves given one's status at birth. maybe their parents paid for ivy league schools, is that an ""inheritance""? maybe their parent's spoke well of them at their venture capital meeting. maybe their last name means they have 500 thousand instagram followers just for taking two selfies a day.

you're a fuckin clown that looks to have drowned in the ayn rand kool-aid so at the end of the day i'm wasting my time, but your little article is also ""trust us we did the research"" on a right wing rag. i'll say it again to really drive it home, you're a fucking clown. your comment right here makes you look like a fucking clown to anyone with a brain.

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG‚Äôs Graphene and UQ‚Äôs patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

Sup, WSB folks!

It‚Äôs Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I‚Äôm the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we‚Äôll take a look at the superior stonk‚Äòs current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‚Äòs fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF‚Äôs GF‚Äôs ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to üêª in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day!

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices.

2293,,2021-05-26 17:48:02,t3_nlmzdx,,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

2294,,2021-05-26 18:08:33,t3_nlnghi,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

https://preview.redd.it/s6s8qwy39i171.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7d910feb79393f4fe0de5fad54e89f5bead4c39

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

There's one outlying stock that has still to rise even though its a huge company and the commodity it sells is sky high. The reason for this is the commodity it sells is hated in the western world. However in the east they can't get enough. The commodity is coal and the company is peabody energy (btu). Coal prices have recently spiked because they are still building coal power stations in China and India. However, banks won't support coal companies any more, so shares in btu are now down to 6 from 45 dollars. The market hasn't recognised this yet... But it will very soon when the quarterly results come in. Btu also leads in carbon capture tech so is a green play as well.

Flip that on its head.

When you take a short position you are selling the stock.  You receive the money from the sale first.  Your obligation to purchase is later.

So if I sold 1,000,000 GME at $150 then I received $150,000,000 from the trade as soon as I traded it.  To replace those 1,000,000 shares with yesterday's closing value, I would need 242,560,000.

Sup, WSB folks!

It‚Äôs Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I‚Äôm the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we‚Äôll take a look at the superior stonk‚Äòs current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‚Äòs fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF‚Äôs GF‚Äôs ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to üêª in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day! 

(and compulsory not a fin advise and fuck you!)",nlmlev,"Daym it feels good to be a GME hodler in times like these! Take a look at this sweet TA picture: Bollinger Bands are boilin', MACD(onalds) pointing north... And the Purple Haze is being tested! How do you like this, Wen Moon?"

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices.

2846,,2021-05-26 17:48:02,t3_nlmzdx,,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

2847,,2021-05-26 18:08:33,t3_nlnghi,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

5000 Barrels x 45$ = 225.000,- $ profit per day
82.125.000,- $ profit per year

EPS of 10 means 
800 Million $ market-cap

Sup, WSB folks!

It‚Äôs Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I‚Äôm the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we‚Äôll take a look at the superior stonk‚Äòs current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‚Äòs fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF‚Äôs GF‚Äôs ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to üêª in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day! 

(and compulsory not a fin advise and fuck you!)",nlmlev,"Daym it feels good to be a GME hodler in times like these! Take a look at this sweet TA picture: Bollinger Bands are boilin', MACD(onalds) pointing north... And the Purple Haze is being tested! How do you like this, Wen Moon?"

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices. I know many people who want to travel but few who want to buy stock.**",nlmxyt,How to profit from the final stages of Coronavirus

3102,,2021-05-26 17:48:02,t3_nlmzdx,,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

3103,,2021-05-26 18:08:33,t3_nlnghi,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

EDIT: short TLDR by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can‚Äôt fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It‚Äôs a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \(high short float\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",nlpfk9,UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me

Black berry‚Äôs forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let‚Äôs start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It‚Äôs essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars‚Äô software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla‚Äôs self driving cars, they‚Äôll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It‚Äôs confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It‚Äôs cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That‚Äôs $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

TLDR --Premise-- ViaSat, Inc (VSAT) is a mediocre company that provides mediocre satellite service that costs way too much for what it is.... but in many places it is the ONLY option... well it was until Mr. üöÄ himself decided to eat their lunch. StarLink (part of SpaceX) is about to absolutely destroy VSAT and turn it to üí©.

TLDR --Strategy-- since you can't invest in SpaceX (private company) or Starlink (until it is spun off into a separate entity **and then DO invest there** ) I think someone that decides to buy PUTS on VSAT (give yourself A LOT of time, I'm talking June 2022 $35 or Jan 2023 $25) stands to make a lot of money ------ I'm personally not starting my position until right before the next earnings report in August. I figure the first sign of trouble will come out in an earnings report and if it isn't August then by November it'll start showing. Again **LONG** duration puts. Looking to catch that cycle when the company drops 50% on the bad news. If it goes up between now and then I'll just buy MORE puts. 

**NOT A PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL PERSON - INVEST AT YOUR OWN RISK - I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE BUT I MAY BE ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™ PERSON WHO EATS üí© FOR ALL YOU KNOW**

details

**ViaSat - How it started**

Market cap of 3.26 Billion, share price of $47.55 when I'm writing this. It got as high as the 90's before the pandemic book the shins out of the market and dropped it to $28. Since recovered a bit to... as I said $47.55

They have some satellites in space that allow people with a receiver dish to get internet from space like some kind of awesome scifi movie.... except the internet is crazy expensive for what you get. Their satellites are pretty high up and that means each one can cover a BIG area. They only seem to have a handful, maybe a dozen? But they offer pretty broad coverage and are expanding it. BUT because the satellites are high up the latency (time between your computer and your internet source or something like that) is high leading to slow speeds and overall not a great service.

They already have airlines as customers, expanding recently with Delta. Their is VERY LITTLE competition in this business and between airlines, cruise lines and rural home owners with no other option they make a nice amount of money. Totally solid business model. Internet is ever more and more important and usage on air planes and boats is only gonna go up. In fact like a lot of articles on VSAT I would probably say this is a good medium / long term buy and that is why the median price target is $67 ***EXCEPT*** I know something that the market doesn't seem to have realized yet.

>EDITED BASED ON COMMENTS

>However, while a viable company may exist beyond the coming reckoning I expect the market to react extremely negatively to ViaSat losing **ALL** of their rural residential and rural small and medium size business customers. I'm also thinking that right around the time that starts sinking in news stories about cruise lines and air lines switching over to StarLink will start popping up and again, $VSAT go **üí©.** I honestly hope VSAT does go up to the current target of the mid $60's because I'll start buying puts a small chunk at a time as it rises. Until then I'm waiting till August, right before next quarterly earnings report to start my position.

**StarLink - How it's going**

as you may the Dogefather happens to have a small üöÄ company. Its called SpaceX and they aren't publicly traded. They also are doing to the aerospace / orbit supply and transport industry what many of us wish Tesla could fully due to the fossil fuel industry. SpaceX's Falcon9 üöÄ is all sorts of amazing - mainly because it isn't thrown out after each use ($40MM in savings for each subsequent use of a booster).

StarLink is a division of SpaceX that is focused on bringing internet to the whole üåé using a crazy amount of satellites. Like... A LOT. Unlike ViaSat which has a few the StarLink constellation (thats what they call a network of satellites) has 16 HUNDRED and they are launching 60 at a time every week or so (sometimes more than once a week). Because StarLink has access to this game changing super cheap üöÄ transportation AND Musk is doing is usual weirdness by mass producing these satellites and focusing on cost and volume instead of making them SUPER DUPER reliable

Some of you may remember how TSLA was this tiny company that was prob gonna die etc. etc. and THEN üí•üí• there are Model 3's and Model Y's EVERYWHERE. Well StarLink is gonna have that moment soon. Sometime in the next few months there will suddenly be high-ish speed internet (between 50mbs and 100mbs) literally ANYWHERE on the planet for $500 down and $100 a month.

# 5/27 Outlook

Today's price üéØ still hold for tomorrow. *(theta starting to take away some of my credibility if I have to keep moving these targets back...)*

Note from [Spot Gamma](https://spotgamma.com/): *""We are looking for another low volatility session tomorrow with 4200 being the key area in play. Low VIX/implied vol could start to add a tailwind to equities as options decay and dealers buy back short hedges.""*

Could positive unemployment numbers and leading economic index reading give SPY the tailwind it needs to reach ATH?

* If 420.73 breaks, look for bullish üéØ : 422.43 - 423.81 - 425.15
* If 417.25 breaks, look for bearish üéØ : 416 - 415 - 414.13 - 412.74 - 411.26 - 410

Performance can only be measured through the entire cycle.    The entire Cycle exposes you from all angles. 

The human brain tends to become infected with greed at the end of a big Stage 2 run (see digital  virtuals  for current example) thus causing people to lose money after a bull market because they expect it to go on forever.

  Understanding Stage Analysis can help you overcome this

3148,,2021-05-26 23:30:49,t3_nlugr7,,wallstreetbets,"CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer said Wednesday he‚Äôs not sure why any investors are still betting against GameStop and AMC Entertainment, two of the so-called meme stocks popular on Reddit‚Äôs WallStreetBets forum.
.
.
The ‚ÄúMad Money‚Äù host made his comments following a session in which GameStop shares rose almost 16% Wednesday and AMC advanced 19%. The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.
.
.
‚ÄúAnyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,‚Äù Cramer said.
.
.
Despite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC ‚Äî which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming ‚Äî is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.
.
.
But Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.
.
.
Shorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.
.
.
When the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.
.
.
Both GameStop and AMC have over 20% of their float shares sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. That‚Äôs compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock.
.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like this: a group of buyers with no sensitivity to price,‚Äù Cramer said. ‚ÄúThese people don‚Äôt have unlimited firepower, but they‚Äôve got enough firepower to engineer a short-squeeze any time a bunch of professionals decide to bet against this thing.‚Äù
.

I don‚Äôt want to share with you something that you all heard so many times (yep, I haven't lost my fate in humanity) like avoid margin trading or invest in mutual funds. I believe I have some wisdom I wish I had from the beginning.

1. Trading is just 5% theory and 95% about emotional control, risk and money management, overcoming one‚Äôs greed, having strict stoploss and targets predefined before taking a trade.
2. Don‚Äôt follow advice from forums blindly. Build your own map of the world. Each of us learn to trade at our own pace and don‚Äôt get discouraged if you find that after a few years, you‚Äôre still struggling to master the ‚Äòmoney game‚Äô. You can keep in mind different advice from experienced players (e.g. I recommend this qooore app and it's discord community), *but it's vital for the final decision to be yours*.
3. Accept losses and do not make investment decisions based on emotion Especially greed, fear, or panic. Yep, you didn‚Äôt buy Betcoin (lol couldn't resist) at 3,000$ because you didn‚Äôt know back than what direction the price would take. No regrets. Keep yourself focused on here and now, move ahead
4. Know yourself. What is your current financial situation? Why you are investing? For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully.
5. Never forget that for investing, time is your best friend - and greed is your worst enemy. Patience is a requirement in stock trading. There are no short-cuts or ‚Äòholy grail‚Äô when it comes to stock. And you only need to have couple of strategies but those should be well tested and made perfect over the period of time.

To me, trading is a skill that requires 3Ls - ‚ÄòLife-Long Learning‚Äù.

Stay humble, be honest and willing to admit your mistakes in trading and don‚Äôt try to rationalise and explain mistakes away, and always remain teachable and never think you‚Äôve ‚Äòarrived‚Äô.",nlvay0,After 3 years of learning investment: my 5 tips for those who just started

3157,,2021-05-27 01:00:08,t3_nlw3ty,,wallstreetbets,"Hi Everyone! I did some research on cinema stocks a while back and made a video on it. I didn't post the content here so I thought I would share it as I know everyone is interested in AMC at the moment! I know it's a lot to read so if you prefer to watch the video, the link for that is also included below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s)

Why Cinema Stocks like AMC will benefit from reopening? 

Time-Frame: Cinema‚Äôs will benefit from reopening and the economic recovery that is occurring all over the world. Especially over a longer timeframe.  I think that Cinemas can be a good trade in the medium term and can help you make money. It‚Äôs all dependent on data and how quickly things go back to normal, but my timeframe on this trade right now is 1-2 years. Maybe even shorter, perhaps 6 months if we bounce back very quickly. Maybe not the most likely, but still a possible scenario that I have to consider. 

&#x200B;

Thesis: 

1)  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a very strong negative impact on the cinema sector. So, naturally as things reopen and vaccinations increase all over North America, these companies stand to benefit. If we look back from the end of January 2020 to the end of April 2021, Marcus Corporation was down approximately 33% from January 27th, 2020. Cinemark is down approximately 35% over the same time period, while National CineMedia is down almost 42% and AMC is up almost 57%. Price is an important factor to consider when buying and selling stocks and this something that is important to consider 

2) Cinemas have suffered tremendously with the Covid-19 pandemic, which makes the cinema sector intriguing as the world re-opens. If we look to Asia, especially China and Japan, where Covid-19 cases subsided and theatres reopened, things look promising.  There was a substantial increase in demand, with demand actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. In China, December 2020 ticket sales at IMAX‚Äôs big-screen theatres jumped 28 per cent from a year earlier, while in Japan, they broke daily records and a record number of people saw movies on the first weekend of January 2021. Clearly, there was a lot of pent-up demand which surfaced and benefitted movie theatres in Asia. 

3) And you know what I‚Äôve seen this film before. Last year early in February, there was a sudden spike in downloads of the Zoom app in China, and the stock at that was point already doing well, up roughly 30 percent from the start of the year. But this spike in Zoom usage soon spread all over the world, and the rest is history. It was an absolutely humungous winner last year. There are obviously sector wide risks with consumer preferences changing, and more and more people preferring to watch films at home. The increase in Netflix & streaming service subscribers over the years is a clear indication of consumer preferences going-forward, but I do like movie theatres as a trade. There is a lot of pent-up demand that I feel will benefit the sector. 

Risks: 

\-  One of the main risks that that most people who are considering trading or investing in cinema companies have, is the risk from Netflix and the other streaming services. Really the risk of the Direct-to-consumer approach and the effects that it will have on the cinema companies. And this is a valid concern because it has reduced demand for cinemas over the last decade. Even some of the biggest filmmakers in the world are turning to it, like Martin Scorsese, Noah Baumbach and Alfonso Cuaron.  Netflix has become the biggest movie studio in the world, at-least when it comes to volume in terms of production over the last several years. And now they plan to release 50-60 films per year, and with their pioneering Direct to Consumer approach, the film industry has changed. Cinemas are no longer at the forefront, and the Direct-to-Consumer strategy is quickly becoming the new incumbent. The DTC approach is taking over, with all the streaming services that have launched. They have taken market share from linear television and have steered consumers away from traditional Cinema.

Catalysts & Conclusion: 

1) However, I still think there is still a place for theatres, even with streaming, especially looking at the same timeframe that I‚Äôm focusing on for this trade. I think now more so than ever people want to be outside. These businesses will benefit from the change in near term consumer trends, with everyone wanting to leave the house. I really believe that the cinema sector is going to do well in North America. If Asia is anything to go by and I think it is, some of the companies involved in the sector have the potential to be great trades. People still want to go to the cinemas, especially when it comes to seeing some of the big budget films that are really made for the big screen. Blockbuster action films with awesome effects are really meant to be seen in a movie theatre in my opinion. The effects and the environment simply cannot be replicated at home. Especially when it comes to immersive experience films, like those with IMAX and 4DX. I really enjoy the cinema and think there is something to be said for being in a big space in a dark room watching a film 40 feet across. It is wonderful to sit in the comfort of your own home but there is just something to be said for having a community experience in a room. But that‚Äôs neither there nor here. 

  
2) Moving on, another potential catalyst is the potential for collaboration between theatre chains and streaming services. Netflix was the one to pioneer the Direct to Consumer, but interestingly they have begun releasing some Netflix Originals on the big screen in recent years. Films like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes all premiered in Cinemas prior to their appearance in Netflix‚Äôs online catalogue.  This is a really interesting move on their part, especially from an investment perspective. Because, while you can watch streaming services in the comfort of your own home, movie theatre companies are open to the idea of having the films that are produced by the streaming services shown in their theatres. Cinemark has shown Netflix movies in theatres in the past, and there is an off chance that they expand their agreement. This wouldn‚Äôt just apply to Cinemark but other theatre chains as well potentially. The big hold-up between the streaming services and theatre chains was the disagreement on the length of theatrical window. But last year, Universal Studios and Cinemark, AMC & Cineplex agreed to a shortened exclusive window, from 74 days to 31 days for major films, as defined by box-office domestic revenue. This makes it more likely that Netflix and other streaming services can find middle ground with the cinema companies. It‚Äôs not all that important a catalyst for the trade, nor is it all that likely, but it is still intriguing and something to consider.

3) A more important catalyst is the release of the next James Bond film, no time to die next year. I‚Äôm really excited about the movie because I‚Äôm a huge James Bond fan. It‚Äôs probably my favourite movie series. And you know what, I‚Äôm not alone. It‚Äôs very popular all over the world. The previous James Bond film, Spectre, grossed nearly $879 million. No Time To Die has been postponed several times due to the pandemic and is due to premiere on October 8th in the United States. I‚Äôm really excited about the movie and will be sure to see in theatres provided it‚Äôs safe to do so. And I think it will be. This movie is really important for the movie theatres because they have been starved and there have just been very few films to show. They have been supply constrained with the lack of new films. No Time To Die is a certain blockbuster and will really help benefit the sector. 

4) Something else that has me really excited is the recent CDC news in the US, with them updating guidance on April 2nd that fully vaccinated people can travel internationally safely and don‚Äôt need to quarantine when they return provided, they test negative within three to five days of their return. They have to test negative before they are allowed to board a return flight to the US. This is really exciting, and this combined with the idea of a vaccine passport as has been proposed by cruise lines and the UK government really provide a lot of momentum for the cinema companies.

3158,,2021-05-27 01:24:58,t3_nlwjwy,,wallstreetbets,"I will try to keep this short and sweet.
In my view the following points are justifiable:
-The VW emissions hack was not an effort to destroy the environment. 
-It was trolling done by VW officials bc they were tired of having the EPA‚Äôs pozzed dick in their asses regarding diesel emission regulations on diesel imports. 
-VW was tired of the EPA because:

     A.  In europe diesel autos make up over half of    
           all car engines. 
     B.  Cars like the Euro-version VW golf wagon      
           get almost 90 mpg. Compare that to the 
           Toyota Prius that gets 40mpg at best. 
     C.  The EPA doesnt want VW to import a 90    
           MPG diesel car to the US because it would    
           kill US auto sales, so the EPA makes diesel 
           regulations so strict that the only diesels 
           VW et. al. can import only manage 45 MPG. 
     D.  And if you want to make things fair, the 
           highest MPG diesel electric hybrid made by 
           VW gets over 200 MPG. 
     E.  Europeans aren‚Äôt idiots: they aren‚Äôt willingly 
          ‚Äúpoisoning themselves‚Äù with diesel fumes. 
          Diesel is just as clean as gas and burning 
          1 gallon of diesel fuel every 90 miles is 
          better for the environment than burning 1 
          gallon of gas every 30 miles. 
     F.  The ‚Äúsmelly/black fume producing‚Äù 
          reputation of diesel in america owes itself to 
          idiot US auto makers that in the 80‚Äôs tried to 
          make frankenstein diesel engines out of 
          modified gas engines and they ran like shit 
          and spewed black smoke. These atrocities    
          were unlike the clean running diesel engines 
          that were being produced in Germany at the 
          same time. 
-In summary, the EPA has been punishing European Auto makers (VW) for American auto makers‚Äô past engineering disgraces, and when VW officials got tired of being unfairly punished they decided to troll the EPA with an emissions hack. 
-They did it to slam some jimmies, not to gain      
profit or destroy the environment. 
-German authorities know this, which is why they released key players like Oliver Schmidt who was let out on parole right after he was transferred from US prison to German authorities. 
-The loss of stock value that occured from the scandal was unjustified then, and the stagnation of VW stock price since then has been unjustified in light of the fact that VW‚Äôs P/E in the last 3 months has been between 50-70 times lower than that of Tesla, and historically it has been foolish to underestimate the ability of Volkswagen to perform at the cutting edge of the industry. 
-The Emissions hack has nothing negative to say about Volkswagens fierce engineering capability and in my view it has something positive to say about the youthfulness and creativity of the company.

Retail shorts have hopped on the bandwagon and when stocks move they tend to over shoot the upside and the downside. 

Sundial has over $1 billion in cash, no debt, positive operating profit, and many valuable passive investments. 

The manipulation that the stock received was absolutely insane. Institutional ownership was less than 2% when SNDL made it‚Äôs run in Feb and the big boys didn‚Äôt want to miss the party and they paid motley fool to write bash articles while they accumulate their position. This is just my assumption, which is never a good thing when valuing stocks, but as a former stock analyst I would bet that institutional ownership will be over 5% very soon and then 10%.

1. Commercial Passenger Flights:

They expect to fly 25 commercial flights in 2022, with six passengers each, which means 150 passengers for 2022.

Ticket cost is around $250k, which translates into revenues of approximately $37.5 million from Commercial Passengers in 2022

2. Additional Revenue:

Besides commercial passengers, the company has also generated some revenue by carrying payloads into space in recent years. Assuming that this will grow to about $12 million by 2022, total revenues would stand at $50 million for the year.

3) Revenue Per Share

Revenue Per Share is likely to grow to about $0.21 in 2022, assuming total shares outstanding of 234 million.

4. Value Per Share

With a sales multiple of about 70 (contains a certain amount of goodwill), it translates into a stock price of about  $15 per Share.

The current share price is $27 per Share. Assuming the assumptions are correct, this explains the current short ratio of 25%.",nm0tqe,"Is Virgin Galactic stock expensive, fair, or cheap priced?"

**Shorting $GLD**

$GLD mostly follows real rates and then the $. 

What has allowed $GLD to prosper recently has been :

a) Ever dovish FED decreasing nominal rates as much as they can via their speeches & slower than expected job gains which have cemented FED forecasts

b) Ever rising inflation expectations due to faulty base effects that are transitory

c) Some impact from Crapto crash with money flowing back into $GLD (some of it at least :/)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I think there has been a gestalt shift on all three items 

a) FED's Clarida & Quarles yesterday have both suggested the beginning of tapering discussions 

> Late yesterday, the Fed‚Äôs Quarles said ‚Äúit will become important for the FOMC to begin discussing our plans to adjust the pace of asset purchases at upcoming meetings.‚Äù Quarles is the Fed‚Äôs Vice Chair for Supervision and it is unusual for him to comment on monetary policy.

aBis) The NFP last month was a serious miss but it's not gonna be repeated : as schools reopen and UIs are not extended in a lot of states, the slaves will go back to finding a slave master before jobs run out. employers have also adjusted somewhat with regards to wage expectations already which should make for a much more balanced jobs market going into the begining of school season

b) Inflation (in CPI sense) has peaked in April or will peak now, Commos have crashed thanks to our lords and saviors, the ccp tightening margins and putting an end to this story. 

c) Crapto stabilized

I know that you are a bunch of inbred retards like myself. And I present to you the most autistic and lowkey genius play out there,

***GamesWorkshop***

**What are they doing?**

GamesWorkshop produce little plastic toys for grown ups with too much money and no dating life. You know the Warhammer 40k and Warhammer Fantasy IP? Thats what they do. They created that stuff. They sit on one if the most popular franchises that is gettint A LOT of attention these days. 

**Why should you care?**

GamesWorkshop is a pretty old company. And it sucked major balls for decades. 

The stock rose 62,9% during the last 12 months. Why should we care now? 

BECAUSE NOW IS THE TIME TO BELIEVE 

Reasons why I¬¥m EXTREMELY BULLISH:

\- the IP¬¥s are gaining traction. Fast. There are so many games comming out theses days that focus on the Warhammer universe, it¬¥s actually insane. If just a fraction of the people playing decide to buy some of these overpriced plastic models GamesWorkshop is making BANK. 

\- The (realtively) new CEO ""gets"" it. His predecessor was a dumb boomer fuck who would not open their IPs for anything besides their own models. But the new guy plays the new media game like a damn fiddle. Since he is in charge the company is running so fucking smooth, it¬¥s insane. They will revive Warhammer Fantasy again (was canceled because of bad management), they plan to produce movies, TV series, they opened a second plant to produce their modells, great games with their IP get released more and more, they are more present on social media, they produce new modells that kick ass, the new IP (Age of Sigmar) that replaced Fantasy actually is great now etc....

With the release of their 9th Warhammer 40k Edition they also released a special starter box (dont worry about the details, you will get the jest in a second). You could preorder it. Because they knew that there was a lot of nerds who wanted to get one of these boxes they produced more of these boxes than of any box previous. Guess what?

It was sold out in 17 minutes. Thats it. The nerds out there are fucking addicted and they want that shit more than crystal meth. And the train is just gaining speed.

Every quarter they blow their earnings report out of the water.

Corona? Made them stronger. Brexit? Didn¬¥t matter.

This company is the equivalent of the ugly nerd in highschool that got jacked and fucks your wife when he is in college. 

Get in there. This thing will blow up.

Do you think it is possible that because of that many shorts, a short squeeze like in late january is likely to occure?   
another of my thoughts was, do you think it might be possible that those short sellers are using bots and other ways to manipulate the opinion of the people and the ratings of their new game cyberpunk2077, to make them even worse than they already are?  
like ""spilling gas into the open fire"", to make people hate the company even more and by that making investors panic and sell - and they profit because of their shorts.   


I just wondered, cause everytime i see a post about cd projekt red on twitter lately, the haters will be much faster to comment than the actual fans, what means either there are people who actually intend to spread negativity regarding this company - to make profit - or these people are actually haters who, unknowingly, make short sellers (including even citadel in this case) earn big money.   


To be clear: Of course CD PROJEKT is to be criticized for their actions, and the drop of their stock price might be well deserved. But I hate to think that, the people who profit from that are even much worse than them and that people who claim to hate the bad ""corpos"" and therefore now hate CD PROJEKT, are helping even worse corpos and dont even know that they do

This follows a pretty quiet day on Wall Street, with some muted gains. Disappointing earnings from Nvidia and Snowflake after the bell appear to be weighing on sentiment now, especially for tech stocks. This is preventing a breakout.

Bunch of economic data releases this morning that people will be watching in anticipation of a Fed adjustment to interest rate policy.

These all drop at 0830: Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) prices are the Fed‚Äôs preferred gauge of inflation. Core prices are expected to have increased by 2.3% in Q1, the same as in Q4. If that number beats the upside then watch out for inflation and tapering talk. 

Durable goods orders should shed some light on supply chain constraints as well as demand from manufacturers. Expectations are for 0.8% print for core orders, down from the 2.3% level in March. 

It‚Äôs Thursday, so we also get initial jobless claims. Economists are expecting another post-pandemic low there, of 425k. That‚Äôs a slight drop from 444k reported last week. 

There‚Äôs also a GDP print, but I don‚Äôt care about that as it‚Äôs entirely backward looking and has no impact on future direction of pretty much anything.

We also have pending home sales at 1000. Expectations there are for 0.8% increase, down from 1.9% in March.

Kinder Morgan has the largest natural gas transmission network with \~70 thousand miles of natural gas pipelines, 659 bcf of storage capacity, and \~1200 miles of NGL. The company is the largest independent transporter of refiner products \~6800 miles of refined product pipelines and \~3100 miles of crude pipelines.

Kinder Morgan is also the largest independent terminal operator with 144 terminals & 16 Jones Act vessels. These together enabled the company to increase natural gas income during the Texas storm, something that wasn't a one-off. The company is the largest CO2 transporter with \~1.5 bcf/day of capacity, showing its strength.

* Kinder Morgan benefited off of the Texas Storm with its DCF expected to reach almost $6 billion for the year.
* The company has a dividend of almost 6% and it's continuing to invest in its business for the long run.
* The company has an impressive and diverse portfolio of assets which we expect it'll be able to utilize to drive substantial long-term shareholder rewards.

3583,,2021-05-26 19:34:02,t3_nlpfk9,,wallstreetbets,"I must start this with do not touch your AMC for anything let alone a stock that hasnt even cemented itself in this new world - but the memeconemy is having a revival and with Wall St's apparent dislike of this company through shorts I think UWMC may have a nice place in this new order.

EDIT: short TLDR by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can‚Äôt fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It‚Äôs a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \(high short float\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",nlpfk9,UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me

Black berry‚Äôs forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let‚Äôs start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It‚Äôs essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars‚Äô software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla‚Äôs self driving cars, they‚Äôll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It‚Äôs confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It‚Äôs cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That‚Äôs $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

TLDR --Premise-- ViaSat, Inc (VSAT) is a mediocre company that provides mediocre satellite service that costs way too much for what it is.... but in many places it is the ONLY option... well it was until Mr. üöÄ himself decided to eat their lunch. StarLink (part of SpaceX) is about to absolutely destroy VSAT and turn it to üí©.

TLDR --Strategy-- since you can't invest in SpaceX (private company) or Starlink (until it is spun off into a separate entity **and then DO invest there** ) I think someone that decides to buy PUTS on VSAT (give yourself A LOT of time, I'm talking June 2022 $35 or Jan 2023 $25) stands to make a lot of money ------ I'm personally not starting my position until right before the next earnings report in August. I figure the first sign of trouble will come out in an earnings report and if it isn't August then by November it'll start showing. Again **LONG** duration puts. Looking to catch that cycle when the company drops 50% on the bad news. If it goes up between now and then I'll just buy MORE puts.

Market cap of 3.26 Billion, share price of $47.55 when I'm writing this. It got as high as the 90's before the pandemic book the shins out of the market and dropped it to $28. Since recovered a bit to... as I said $47.55

They have some satellites in space that allow people with a receiver dish to get internet from space like some kind of awesome scifi movie.... except the internet is crazy expensive for what you get. Their satellites are pretty high up and that means each one can cover a BIG area. They only seem to have a handful, maybe a dozen? But they offer pretty broad coverage and are expanding it. BUT because the satellites are high up the latency (time between your computer and your internet source or something like that) is high leading to slow speeds and overall not a great service.

They already have airlines as customers, expanding recently with Delta. Their is VERY LITTLE competition in this business and between airlines, cruise lines and rural home owners with no other option they make a nice amount of money. Totally solid business model. Internet is ever more and more important and usage on air planes and boats is only gonna go up. In fact like a lot of articles on VSAT I would probably say this is a good medium / long term buy and that is why the median price target is $67 ***EXCEPT*** I know something that the market doesn't seem to have realized yet.

>EDITED BASED ON COMMENTS  
>  
>ViaSat does have commercial business beyond airlines and cruises; I would imagine rural businesses and some VERY LARGE corporations that use it for specific use cases. There is also the DOD which they have contracts with.

>  
>**I AM NOT ASSERTING THAT VIA SAT WILL GO COMPLETELY OUT OF BUSINESS.**  
>  
>  
>  
>However, while a viable company may exist beyond the coming reckoning I expect the market to react extremely negatively to ViaSat losing **ALL** of their rural residential and rural small and medium size business customers. I'm also thinking that right around the time that starts sinking in news stories about cruise lines and air lines switching over to StarLink will start popping up and again, $VSAT go **üí©.** I honestly hope VSAT does go up to the current target of the mid $60's because I'll start buying puts a small chunk at a time as it rises. Until then I'm waiting till August, right before next quarterly earnings report to start my position.

**StarLink - How it's going**

as you may the Dogefather happens to have a small üöÄ company. Its called SpaceX and they aren't publicly traded. They also are doing to the aerospace / orbit supply and transport industry what many of us wish Tesla could fully due to the fossil fuel industry. SpaceX's Falcon9 üöÄ is all sorts of amazing - mainly because it isn't thrown out after each use ($40MM in savings for each subsequent use of a booster).

StarLink is a division of SpaceX that is focused on bringing internet to the whole üåé using a crazy amount of satellites. Like... A LOT. Unlike ViaSat which has a few the StarLink constellation (thats what they call a network of satellites) has 16 HUNDRED and they are launching 60 at a time every week or so (sometimes more than once a week). Because StarLink has access to this game changing super cheap üöÄ transportation AND Musk is doing is usual weirdness by mass producing these satellites and focusing on cost and volume instead of making them SUPER DUPER reliable

Some of you may remember how TSLA was this tiny company that was prob gonna die etc. etc. and THEN üí•üí• there are Model 3's and Model Y's EVERYWHERE. Well StarLink is gonna have that moment soon. Sometime in the next few months there will suddenly be high-ish speed internet (between 50mbs and 100mbs) literally ANYWHERE on the planet for $500 down and $100 a month. Way better product and on an annualized basis way better value.",nlsu85,First real post on WSB - found a walking zombie üßü and wanted to share... I bring you a tale of.... $VSAT

Performance can only be measured through the entire cycle.    The entire Cycle exposes you from all angles. 

The human brain tends to become infected with greed at the end of a big Stage 2 run (see digital  virtuals  for current example) thus causing people to lose money after a bull market because they expect it to go on forever.

  Understanding Stage Analysis can help you overcome this  

&#x200B;

So now let's  dig in our today's post and my targets  : 

1-  Silver will enjoy huge capital flows from those digital assets  holders in a time after overcame and understand stage analysis .... who will now seek the silver whale! 

&#x200B;

2- We are in stage 2 for silver  !!! We can expect parabolic moves any time .  

 Opportunity of buying silver cheap and timely is about to end. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  ( gold did it 2020 July ) 

So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN?  

Tic Toc !

&#x200B;

3-  Silver is in a position of strength. US Dollar is in a position of weakness. 

 The final 15% decline in the US Dollar index WILL send silver parabolic!

&#x200B;

4-  The ""silver"" macro tidal wave is picking up steam &will crush all price suppression along the way...  Q2 close will set the stage how fast the insanity picks up.  HOLD ON TIGHT! Easy 56$ and 120$ targets

3612,,2021-05-26 23:30:49,t3_nlugr7,,wallstreetbets,"CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer said Wednesday he‚Äôs not sure why any investors are still betting against GameStop and AMC Entertainment, two of the so-called meme stocks popular on Reddit‚Äôs WallStreetBets forum.
.
.
The ‚ÄúMad Money‚Äù host made his comments following a session in which GameStop shares rose almost 16% Wednesday and AMC advanced 19%. The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.
.
.
‚ÄúAnyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,‚Äù Cramer said.
.
.
Despite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC ‚Äî which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming ‚Äî is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.
.
.
But Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.
.
.
Shorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.
.
.
When the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.
.
.
Both GameStop and AMC have over 20% of their float shares sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. That‚Äôs compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock.
.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like this: a group of buyers with no sensitivity to price,‚Äù Cramer said. ‚ÄúThese people don‚Äôt have unlimited firepower, but they‚Äôve got enough firepower to engineer a short-squeeze any time a bunch of professionals decide to bet against this thing.‚Äù
.

I don‚Äôt want to share with you something that you all heard so many times (yep, I haven't lost my fate in humanity) like avoid margin trading or invest in mutual funds. I believe I have some wisdom I wish I had from the beginning.

1. Trading is just 5% theory and 95% about emotional control, risk and money management, overcoming one‚Äôs greed, having strict stoploss and targets predefined before taking a trade.
2. Don‚Äôt follow advice from forums blindly. Build your own map of the world. Each of us learn to trade at our own pace and don‚Äôt get discouraged if you find that after a few years, you‚Äôre still struggling to master the ‚Äòmoney game‚Äô. You can keep in mind different advice from experienced players (e.g. I recommend this qooore app and it's discord community), *but it's vital for the final decision to be yours*.
3. Accept losses and do not make investment decisions based on emotion Especially greed, fear, or panic. Yep, you didn‚Äôt buy Betcoin (lol couldn't resist) at 3,000$ because you didn‚Äôt know back than what direction the price would take. No regrets. Keep yourself focused on here and now, move ahead
4. Know yourself. What is your current financial situation? Why you are investing? For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully.
5. Never forget that for investing, time is your best friend - and greed is your worst enemy. Patience is a requirement in stock trading. There are no short-cuts or ‚Äòholy grail‚Äô when it comes to stock. And you only need to have couple of strategies but those should be well tested and made perfect over the period of time.

To me, trading is a skill that requires 3Ls - ‚ÄòLife-Long Learning‚Äù.

Stay humble, be honest and willing to admit your mistakes in trading and don‚Äôt try to rationalise and explain mistakes away, and always remain teachable and never think you‚Äôve ‚Äòarrived‚Äô.",nlvay0,After 3 years of learning investment: my 5 tips for those who just started

NightMan",nlw09c,Viva La TSLA
3621,,2021-05-27 01:00:08,t3_nlw3ty,,wallstreetbets,"Hi Everyone! I did some research on cinema stocks a while back and made a video on it. I didn't post the content here so I thought I would share it as I know everyone is interested in AMC at the moment! I know it's a lot to read so if you prefer to watch the video, the link for that is also included below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s)

Why Cinema Stocks like AMC will benefit from reopening? 

Time-Frame: Cinema‚Äôs will benefit from reopening and the economic recovery that is occurring all over the world. Especially over a longer timeframe.  I think that Cinemas can be a good trade in the medium term and can help you make money. It‚Äôs all dependent on data and how quickly things go back to normal, but my timeframe on this trade right now is 1-2 years. Maybe even shorter, perhaps 6 months if we bounce back very quickly. Maybe not the most likely, but still a possible scenario that I have to consider. 

&#x200B;

Thesis: 

1)  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a very strong negative impact on the cinema sector. So, naturally as things reopen and vaccinations increase all over North America, these companies stand to benefit. If we look back from the end of January 2020 to the end of April 2021, Marcus Corporation was down approximately 33% from January 27th, 2020. Cinemark is down approximately 35% over the same time period, while National CineMedia is down almost 42% and AMC is up almost 57%. Price is an important factor to consider when buying and selling stocks and this something that is important to consider 

2) Cinemas have suffered tremendously with the Covid-19 pandemic, which makes the cinema sector intriguing as the world re-opens. If we look to Asia, especially China and Japan, where Covid-19 cases subsided and theatres reopened, things look promising.  There was a substantial increase in demand, with demand actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. In China, December 2020 ticket sales at IMAX‚Äôs big-screen theatres jumped 28 per cent from a year earlier, while in Japan, they broke daily records and a record number of people saw movies on the first weekend of January 2021. Clearly, there was a lot of pent-up demand which surfaced and benefitted movie theatres in Asia. 

3) And you know what I‚Äôve seen this film before. Last year early in February, there was a sudden spike in downloads of the Zoom app in China, and the stock at that was point already doing well, up roughly 30 percent from the start of the year. But this spike in Zoom usage soon spread all over the world, and the rest is history. It was an absolutely humungous winner last year. There are obviously sector wide risks with consumer preferences changing, and more and more people preferring to watch films at home. The increase in Netflix & streaming service subscribers over the years is a clear indication of consumer preferences going-forward, but I do like movie theatres as a trade. There is a lot of pent-up demand that I feel will benefit the sector. 

Risks: 

\-  One of the main risks that that most people who are considering trading or investing in cinema companies have, is the risk from Netflix and the other streaming services. Really the risk of the Direct-to-consumer approach and the effects that it will have on the cinema companies. And this is a valid concern because it has reduced demand for cinemas over the last decade. Even some of the biggest filmmakers in the world are turning to it, like Martin Scorsese, Noah Baumbach and Alfonso Cuaron.  Netflix has become the biggest movie studio in the world, at-least when it comes to volume in terms of production over the last several years. And now they plan to release 50-60 films per year, and with their pioneering Direct to Consumer approach, the film industry has changed. Cinemas are no longer at the forefront, and the Direct-to-Consumer strategy is quickly becoming the new incumbent. The DTC approach is taking over, with all the streaming services that have launched. They have taken market share from linear television and have steered consumers away from traditional Cinema.

Catalysts & Conclusion: 

1) However, I still think there is still a place for theatres, even with streaming, especially looking at the same timeframe that I‚Äôm focusing on for this trade. I think now more so than ever people want to be outside. These businesses will benefit from the change in near term consumer trends, with everyone wanting to leave the house. I really believe that the cinema sector is going to do well in North America. If Asia is anything to go by and I think it is, some of the companies involved in the sector have the potential to be great trades. People still want to go to the cinemas, especially when it comes to seeing some of the big budget films that are really made for the big screen. Blockbuster action films with awesome effects are really meant to be seen in a movie theatre in my opinion. The effects and the environment simply cannot be replicated at home. Especially when it comes to immersive experience films, like those with IMAX and 4DX. I really enjoy the cinema and think there is something to be said for being in a big space in a dark room watching a film 40 feet across. It is wonderful to sit in the comfort of your own home but there is just something to be said for having a community experience in a room. But that‚Äôs neither there nor here. 

  
2) Moving on, another potential catalyst is the potential for collaboration between theatre chains and streaming services. Netflix was the one to pioneer the Direct to Consumer, but interestingly they have begun releasing some Netflix Originals on the big screen in recent years. Films like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes all premiered in Cinemas prior to their appearance in Netflix‚Äôs online catalogue.  This is a really interesting move on their part, especially from an investment perspective. Because, while you can watch streaming services in the comfort of your own home, movie theatre companies are open to the idea of having the films that are produced by the streaming services shown in their theatres. Cinemark has shown Netflix movies in theatres in the past, and there is an off chance that they expand their agreement. This wouldn‚Äôt just apply to Cinemark but other theatre chains as well potentially. The big hold-up between the streaming services and theatre chains was the disagreement on the length of theatrical window. But last year, Universal Studios and Cinemark, AMC & Cineplex agreed to a shortened exclusive window, from 74 days to 31 days for major films, as defined by box-office domestic revenue. This makes it more likely that Netflix and other streaming services can find middle ground with the cinema companies. It‚Äôs not all that important a catalyst for the trade, nor is it all that likely, but it is still intriguing and something to consider.

3) A more important catalyst is the release of the next James Bond film, no time to die next year. I‚Äôm really excited about the movie because I‚Äôm a huge James Bond fan. It‚Äôs probably my favourite movie series. And you know what, I‚Äôm not alone. It‚Äôs very popular all over the world. The previous James Bond film, Spectre, grossed nearly $879 million. No Time To Die has been postponed several times due to the pandemic and is due to premiere on October 8th in the United States. I‚Äôm really excited about the movie and will be sure to see in theatres provided it‚Äôs safe to do so. And I think it will be. This movie is really important for the movie theatres because they have been starved and there have just been very few films to show. They have been supply constrained with the lack of new films. No Time To Die is a certain blockbuster and will really help benefit the sector. 

4) Something else that has me really excited is the recent CDC news in the US, with them updating guidance on April 2nd that fully vaccinated people can travel internationally safely and don‚Äôt need to quarantine when they return provided, they test negative within three to five days of their return. They have to test negative before they are allowed to board a return flight to the US. This is really exciting, and this combined with the idea of a vaccine passport as has been proposed by cruise lines and the UK government really provide a lot of momentum for the cinema companies.

In my view the following points are justifiable:
-The VW emissions hack was not an effort to destroy the environment. 
-It was trolling done by VW officials bc they were tired of having the EPA‚Äôs pozzed dick in their asses regarding diesel emission regulations on diesel imports. 
-VW was tired of the EPA because:

     A.  In europe diesel autos make up over half of    
           all car engines. 
     B.  Cars like the Euro-version VW golf wagon      
           get almost 90 mpg. Compare that to the 
           Toyota Prius that gets 40mpg at best. 
     C.  The EPA doesnt want VW to import a 90    
           MPG diesel car to the US because it would    
           kill US auto sales, so the EPA makes diesel 
           regulations so strict that the only diesels 
           VW et. al. can import only manage 45 MPG. 
     D.  And if you want to make things fair, the 
           highest MPG diesel electric hybrid made by 
           VW gets over 200 MPG. 
     E.  Europeans aren‚Äôt idiots: they aren‚Äôt willingly 
          ‚Äúpoisoning themselves‚Äù with diesel fumes. 
          Diesel is just as clean as gas and burning 
          1 gallon of diesel fuel every 90 miles is 
          better for the environment than burning 1 
          gallon of gas every 30 miles. 
     F.  The ‚Äúsmelly/black fume producing‚Äù 
          reputation of diesel in america owes itself to 
          idiot US auto makers that in the 80‚Äôs tried to 
          make frankenstein diesel engines out of 
          modified gas engines and they ran like shit 
          and spewed black smoke. These atrocities    
          were unlike the clean running diesel engines 
          that were being produced in Germany at the 
          same time. 
-In summary, the EPA has been punishing European Auto makers (VW) for American auto makers‚Äô past engineering disgraces, and when VW officials got tired of being unfairly punished they decided to troll the EPA with an emissions hack. 
-They did it to slam some jimmies, not to gain      
profit or destroy the environment. 
-German authorities know this, which is why they released key players like Oliver Schmidt who was let out on parole right after he was transferred from US prison to German authorities. 
-The loss of stock value that occured from the scandal was unjustified then, and the stagnation of VW stock price since then has been unjustified in light of the fact that VW‚Äôs P/E in the last 3 months has been between 50-70 times lower than that of Tesla, and historically it has been foolish to underestimate the ability of Volkswagen to perform at the cutting edge of the industry. 
-The Emissions hack has nothing negative to say about Volkswagens fierce engineering capability and in my view it has something positive to say about the youthfulness and creativity of the company.

Besides commercial passengers, the company has also generated some revenue by carrying payloads into space in recent years. Assuming that this will grow to about $12 million by 2022, total revenues would stand at $50 million for the year.

$GLD mostly follows real rates and then the $. 

What has allowed $GLD to prosper recently has been :

a) Ever dovish FED decreasing nominal rates as much as they can via their speeches & slower than expected job gains which have cemented FED forecasts

b) Ever rising inflation expectations due to faulty base effects that are transitory

c) Some impact from Crapto crash with money flowing back into $GLD (some of it at least :/)

> Late yesterday, the Fed‚Äôs Quarles said ‚Äúit will become important for the FOMC to begin discussing our plans to adjust the pace of asset purchases at upcoming meetings.‚Äù Quarles is the Fed‚Äôs Vice Chair for Supervision and it is unusual for him to comment on monetary policy.

aBis) The NFP last month was a serious miss but it's not gonna be repeated : as schools reopen and UIs are not extended in a lot of states, the slaves will go back to finding a slave master before jobs run out. employers have also adjusted somewhat with regards to wage expectations already which should make for a much more balanced jobs market going into the begining of school season

b) Inflation (in CPI sense) has peaked in April or will peak now, Commos have crashed thanks to our lords and saviors, the ccp tightening margins and putting an end to this story.

GamesWorkshop produce little plastic toys for grown ups with too much money and no dating life. You know the Warhammer 40k and Warhammer Fantasy IP? Thats what they do. They created that stuff. They sit on one if the most popular franchises that is gettint A LOT of attention these days.

\- the IP¬¥s are gaining traction. Fast. There are so many games comming out theses days that focus on the Warhammer universe, it¬¥s actually insane. If just a fraction of the people playing decide to buy some of these overpriced plastic models GamesWorkshop is making BANK. 

\- The (realtively) new CEO ""gets"" it. His predecessor was a dumb boomer fuck who would not open their IPs for anything besides their own models. But the new guy plays the new media game like a damn fiddle. Since he is in charge the company is running so fucking smooth, it¬¥s insane. They will revive Warhammer Fantasy again (was canceled because of bad management), they plan to produce movies, TV series, they opened a second plant to produce their modells, great games with their IP get released more and more, they are more present on social media, they produce new modells that kick ass, the new IP (Age of Sigmar) that replaced Fantasy actually is great now etc....

With the release of their 9th Warhammer 40k Edition they also released a special starter box (dont worry about the details, you will get the jest in a second). You could preorder it. Because they knew that there was a lot of nerds who wanted to get one of these boxes they produced more of these boxes than of any box previous. Guess what?

It was sold out in 17 minutes. Thats it. The nerds out there are fucking addicted and they want that shit more than crystal meth. And the train is just gaining speed.

Every quarter they blow their earnings report out of the water.

Do you think it is possible that because of that many shorts, a short squeeze like in late january is likely to occure?   
another of my thoughts was, do you think it might be possible that those short sellers are using bots and other ways to manipulate the opinion of the people and the ratings of their new game cyberpunk2077, to make them even worse than they already are?  
like ""spilling gas into the open fire"", to make people hate the company even more and by that making investors panic and sell - and they profit because of their shorts.   


I just wondered, cause everytime i see a post about cd projekt red on twitter lately, the haters will be much faster to comment than the actual fans, what means either there are people who actually intend to spread negativity regarding this company - to make profit - or these people are actually haters who, unknowingly, make short sellers (including even citadel in this case) earn big money.   


To be clear: Of course CD PROJEKT is to be criticized for their actions, and the drop of their stock price might be well deserved.

Selling stocks at a loss that then go past your buy price, or selling stocks after they raise only for them to go far higher is part of the game. Don't regret or dwell on these trades. It's important to look at the bigger, longer picture. As long as you win more than you lose, you are winning. 

There is a lot of money to be made. If you can achieve consistent results, keep at it and don't start doing weird risky bullshit.

Personally I've traded on and off for about 10 years(crypto initially) and these days I increase my portfolio 10%-15%~ or so each month. Its nothing crazy like DFV, but I know if I just keep humming away and ignoring what I could currently do with that money, it'll be several million before I'm 35.

4228,,2021-05-26 19:34:02,t3_nlpfk9,,wallstreetbets,"I must start this with do not touch your AMC for anything let alone a stock that hasnt even cemented itself in this new world - but the memeconemy is having a revival and with Wall St's apparent dislike of this company through shorts I think UWMC may have a nice place in this new order.

EDIT: short TLDR by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can‚Äôt fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It‚Äôs a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \(high short float\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",nlpfk9,UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me

They will never cure anything, but for kids with muscular distrophy just keeping them from getting worse is as good as a cure.  Cathy Wood took a position and exited it fairly quickly, before the most recent good data.  If they can retrace even half of the move down from earlier this year it would be a big gain.

Black berry‚Äôs forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let‚Äôs start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It‚Äôs essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars‚Äô software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla‚Äôs self driving cars, they‚Äôll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It‚Äôs confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It‚Äôs cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That‚Äôs $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

TLDR --Premise-- ViaSat, Inc (VSAT) is a mediocre company that provides mediocre satellite service that costs way too much for what it is.... but in many places it is the ONLY option... well it was until Mr. üöÄ himself decided to eat their lunch. StarLink (part of SpaceX) is about to absolutely destroy VSAT and turn it to üí©.

TLDR --Strategy-- since you can't invest in SpaceX (private company) or Starlink (until it is spun off into a separate entity **and then DO invest there** ) I think someone that decides to buy PUTS on VSAT (give yourself A LOT of time, I'm talking June 2022 $35 or Jan 2023 $25) stands to make a lot of money ------ I'm personally not starting my position until right before the next earnings report in August. I figure the first sign of trouble will come out in an earnings report and if it isn't August then by November it'll start showing. Again **LONG** duration puts. Looking to catch that cycle when the company drops 50% on the bad news. If it goes up between now and then I'll just buy MORE puts. 

**NOT A PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL PERSON - INVEST AT YOUR OWN RISK - I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE BUT I MAY BE ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™ PERSON WHO EATS üí© FOR ALL YOU KNOW**

details

**ViaSat - How it started**

Market cap of 3.26 Billion, share price of $47.55 when I'm writing this. It got as high as the 90's before the pandemic book the shins out of the market and dropped it to $28. Since recovered a bit to... as I said $47.55

They have some satellites in space that allow people with a receiver dish to get internet from space like some kind of awesome scifi movie.... except the internet is crazy expensive for what you get. Their satellites are pretty high up and that means each one can cover a BIG area. They only seem to have a handful, maybe a dozen? But they offer pretty broad coverage and are expanding it. BUT because the satellites are high up the latency (time between your computer and your internet source or something like that) is high leading to slow speeds and overall not a great service.

They already have airlines as customers, expanding recently with Delta. Their is VERY LITTLE competition in this business and between airlines, cruise lines and rural home owners with no other option they make a nice amount of money. Totally solid business model. Internet is ever more and more important and usage on air planes and boats is only gonna go up. In fact like a lot of articles on VSAT I would probably say this is a good medium / long term buy and that is why the median price target is $67 ***EXCEPT*** I know something that the market doesn't seem to have realized yet.

I'm also thinking that right around the time that starts sinking in news stories about cruise lines and air lines switching over to StarLink will start popping up and again, $VSAT go **üí©.** I honestly hope VSAT does go up to the current target of the mid $60's because I'll start buying puts a small chunk at a time as it rises. Until then I'm waiting till August, right before next quarterly earnings report to start my position.

**StarLink - How it's going**

as you may the Dogefather happens to have a small üöÄ company. Its called SpaceX and they aren't publicly traded. They also are doing to the aerospace / orbit supply and transport industry what many of us wish Tesla could fully due to the fossil fuel industry. SpaceX's Falcon9 üöÄ is all sorts of amazing - mainly because it isn't thrown out after each use ($40MM in savings for each subsequent use of a booster).

StarLink is a division of SpaceX that is focused on bringing internet to the whole üåé using a crazy amount of satellites. Like... A LOT. Unlike ViaSat which has a few the StarLink constellation (thats what they call a network of satellites) has 16 HUNDRED and they are launching 60 at a time every week or so (sometimes more than once a week). Because StarLink has access to this game changing super cheap üöÄ transportation AND Musk is doing is usual weirdness by mass producing these satellites and focusing on cost and volume instead of making them SUPER DUPER reliable

Some of you may remember how TSLA was this tiny company that was prob gonna die etc. etc. and THEN üí•üí• there are Model 3's and Model Y's EVERYWHERE. Well StarLink is gonna have that moment soon. Sometime in the next few months there will suddenly be high-ish speed internet (between 50mbs and 100mbs) literally ANYWHERE on the planet for $500 down and $100 a month. Way better product and on an annualized basis way better value.",nlsu85,First real post on WSB - found a walking zombie üßü and wanted to share... I bring you a tale of.... $VSAT

Performance can only be measured through the entire cycle.    The entire Cycle exposes you from all angles. 

The human brain tends to become infected with greed at the end of a big Stage 2 run (see digital  virtuals  for current example) thus causing people to lose money after a bull market because they expect it to go on forever.

  Understanding Stage Analysis can help you overcome this  

&#x200B;

So now let's  dig in our today's post and my targets  : 

1-  Silver will enjoy huge capital flows from those digital assets  holders in a time after overcame and understand stage analysis .... who will now seek the silver whale! 

&#x200B;

2- We are in stage 2 for silver  !!! We can expect parabolic moves any time .  

 Opportunity of buying silver cheap and timely is about to end. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  ( gold did it 2020 July ) 

So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN?  

Tic Toc !

&#x200B;

3-  Silver is in a position of strength. US Dollar is in a position of weakness. 

 The final 15% decline in the US Dollar index WILL send silver parabolic!

&#x200B;

4-  The ""silver"" macro tidal wave is picking up steam &will crush all price suppression along the way...  Q2 close will set the stage how fast the insanity picks up.  HOLD ON TIGHT! Easy 56$ and 120$ targets

4257,,2021-05-26 23:30:49,t3_nlugr7,,wallstreetbets,"CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer said Wednesday he‚Äôs not sure why any investors are still betting against GameStop and AMC Entertainment, two of the so-called meme stocks popular on Reddit‚Äôs WallStreetBets forum.
.
.
The ‚ÄúMad Money‚Äù host made his comments following a session in which GameStop shares rose almost 16% Wednesday and AMC advanced 19%. The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.
.
.
‚ÄúAnyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,‚Äù Cramer said.
.
.
Despite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC ‚Äî which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming ‚Äî is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.
.
.
But Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.
.
.
Shorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.
.
.
When the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.
.
.
Both GameStop and AMC have over 20% of their float shares sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. That‚Äôs compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock.
.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like this: a group of buyers with no sensitivity to price,‚Äù Cramer said. ‚ÄúThese people don‚Äôt have unlimited firepower, but they‚Äôve got enough firepower to engineer a short-squeeze any time a bunch of professionals decide to bet against this thing.‚Äù
.

I don‚Äôt want to share with you something that you all heard so many times (yep, I haven't lost my fate in humanity) like avoid margin trading or invest in mutual funds. I believe I have some wisdom I wish I had from the beginning.

1. Trading is just 5% theory and 95% about emotional control, risk and money management, overcoming one‚Äôs greed, having strict stoploss and targets predefined before taking a trade.
2. Don‚Äôt follow advice from forums blindly. Build your own map of the world. Each of us learn to trade at our own pace and don‚Äôt get discouraged if you find that after a few years, you‚Äôre still struggling to master the ‚Äòmoney game‚Äô. You can keep in mind different advice from experienced players (e.g. I recommend this qooore app and it's discord community), *but it's vital for the final decision to be yours*.
3. Accept losses and do not make investment decisions based on emotion Especially greed, fear, or panic. Yep, you didn‚Äôt buy Betcoin (lol couldn't resist) at 3,000$ because you didn‚Äôt know back than what direction the price would take. No regrets. Keep yourself focused on here and now, move ahead
4. Know yourself. What is your current financial situation? Why you are investing? For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully.
5. Never forget that for investing, time is your best friend - and greed is your worst enemy. Patience is a requirement in stock trading. There are no short-cuts or ‚Äòholy grail‚Äô when it comes to stock. And you only need to have couple of strategies but those should be well tested and made perfect over the period of time.

To me, trading is a skill that requires 3Ls - ‚ÄòLife-Long Learning‚Äù.

Stay humble, be honest and willing to admit your mistakes in trading and don‚Äôt try to rationalise and explain mistakes away, and always remain teachable and never think you‚Äôve ‚Äòarrived‚Äô.",nlvay0,After 3 years of learning investment: my 5 tips for those who just started

NightMan",nlw09c,Viva La TSLA
4266,,2021-05-27 01:00:08,t3_nlw3ty,,wallstreetbets,"Hi Everyone! I did some research on cinema stocks a while back and made a video on it. I didn't post the content here so I thought I would share it as I know everyone is interested in AMC at the moment! I know it's a lot to read so if you prefer to watch the video, the link for that is also included below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s)

Why Cinema Stocks like AMC will benefit from reopening? 

Time-Frame: Cinema‚Äôs will benefit from reopening and the economic recovery that is occurring all over the world. Especially over a longer timeframe.  I think that Cinemas can be a good trade in the medium term and can help you make money. It‚Äôs all dependent on data and how quickly things go back to normal, but my timeframe on this trade right now is 1-2 years. Maybe even shorter, perhaps 6 months if we bounce back very quickly. Maybe not the most likely, but still a possible scenario that I have to consider. 

&#x200B;

Thesis: 

1)  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a very strong negative impact on the cinema sector. So, naturally as things reopen and vaccinations increase all over North America, these companies stand to benefit. If we look back from the end of January 2020 to the end of April 2021, Marcus Corporation was down approximately 33% from January 27th, 2020. Cinemark is down approximately 35% over the same time period, while National CineMedia is down almost 42% and AMC is up almost 57%. Price is an important factor to consider when buying and selling stocks and this something that is important to consider 

2) Cinemas have suffered tremendously with the Covid-19 pandemic, which makes the cinema sector intriguing as the world re-opens. If we look to Asia, especially China and Japan, where Covid-19 cases subsided and theatres reopened, things look promising.  There was a substantial increase in demand, with demand actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. In China, December 2020 ticket sales at IMAX‚Äôs big-screen theatres jumped 28 per cent from a year earlier, while in Japan, they broke daily records and a record number of people saw movies on the first weekend of January 2021. Clearly, there was a lot of pent-up demand which surfaced and benefitted movie theatres in Asia. 

3) And you know what I‚Äôve seen this film before. Last year early in February, there was a sudden spike in downloads of the Zoom app in China, and the stock at that was point already doing well, up roughly 30 percent from the start of the year. But this spike in Zoom usage soon spread all over the world, and the rest is history. It was an absolutely humungous winner last year. There are obviously sector wide risks with consumer preferences changing, and more and more people preferring to watch films at home. The increase in Netflix & streaming service subscribers over the years is a clear indication of consumer preferences going-forward, but I do like movie theatres as a trade. There is a lot of pent-up demand that I feel will benefit the sector. 

Risks: 

\-  One of the main risks that that most people who are considering trading or investing in cinema companies have, is the risk from Netflix and the other streaming services. Really the risk of the Direct-to-consumer approach and the effects that it will have on the cinema companies. And this is a valid concern because it has reduced demand for cinemas over the last decade. Even some of the biggest filmmakers in the world are turning to it, like Martin Scorsese, Noah Baumbach and Alfonso Cuaron.  Netflix has become the biggest movie studio in the world, at-least when it comes to volume in terms of production over the last several years. And now they plan to release 50-60 films per year, and with their pioneering Direct to Consumer approach, the film industry has changed. Cinemas are no longer at the forefront, and the Direct-to-Consumer strategy is quickly becoming the new incumbent. The DTC approach is taking over, with all the streaming services that have launched. They have taken market share from linear television and have steered consumers away from traditional Cinema.

Catalysts & Conclusion: 

1) However, I still think there is still a place for theatres, even with streaming, especially looking at the same timeframe that I‚Äôm focusing on for this trade. I think now more so than ever people want to be outside. These businesses will benefit from the change in near term consumer trends, with everyone wanting to leave the house. I really believe that the cinema sector is going to do well in North America. If Asia is anything to go by and I think it is, some of the companies involved in the sector have the potential to be great trades. People still want to go to the cinemas, especially when it comes to seeing some of the big budget films that are really made for the big screen. Blockbuster action films with awesome effects are really meant to be seen in a movie theatre in my opinion. The effects and the environment simply cannot be replicated at home. Especially when it comes to immersive experience films, like those with IMAX and 4DX. I really enjoy the cinema and think there is something to be said for being in a big space in a dark room watching a film 40 feet across. It is wonderful to sit in the comfort of your own home but there is just something to be said for having a community experience in a room. But that‚Äôs neither there nor here. 

  
2) Moving on, another potential catalyst is the potential for collaboration between theatre chains and streaming services. Netflix was the one to pioneer the Direct to Consumer, but interestingly they have begun releasing some Netflix Originals on the big screen in recent years. Films like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes all premiered in Cinemas prior to their appearance in Netflix‚Äôs online catalogue.  This is a really interesting move on their part, especially from an investment perspective. Because, while you can watch streaming services in the comfort of your own home, movie theatre companies are open to the idea of having the films that are produced by the streaming services shown in their theatres. Cinemark has shown Netflix movies in theatres in the past, and there is an off chance that they expand their agreement. This wouldn‚Äôt just apply to Cinemark but other theatre chains as well potentially. The big hold-up between the streaming services and theatre chains was the disagreement on the length of theatrical window. But last year, Universal Studios and Cinemark, AMC & Cineplex agreed to a shortened exclusive window, from 74 days to 31 days for major films, as defined by box-office domestic revenue. This makes it more likely that Netflix and other streaming services can find middle ground with the cinema companies. It‚Äôs not all that important a catalyst for the trade, nor is it all that likely, but it is still intriguing and something to consider.

3) A more important catalyst is the release of the next James Bond film, no time to die next year. I‚Äôm really excited about the movie because I‚Äôm a huge James Bond fan. It‚Äôs probably my favourite movie series. And you know what, I‚Äôm not alone. It‚Äôs very popular all over the world. The previous James Bond film, Spectre, grossed nearly $879 million. No Time To Die has been postponed several times due to the pandemic and is due to premiere on October 8th in the United States. I‚Äôm really excited about the movie and will be sure to see in theatres provided it‚Äôs safe to do so. And I think it will be. This movie is really important for the movie theatres because they have been starved and there have just been very few films to show. They have been supply constrained with the lack of new films. No Time To Die is a certain blockbuster and will really help benefit the sector. 

4) Something else that has me really excited is the recent CDC news in the US, with them updating guidance on April 2nd that fully vaccinated people can travel internationally safely and don‚Äôt need to quarantine when they return provided, they test negative within three to five days of their return. They have to test negative before they are allowed to board a return flight to the US. This is really exciting, and this combined with the idea of a vaccine passport as has been proposed by cruise lines and the UK government really provide a lot of momentum for the cinema companies.

In my view the following points are justifiable:
-The VW emissions hack was not an effort to destroy the environment. 
-It was trolling done by VW officials bc they were tired of having the EPA‚Äôs pozzed dick in their asses regarding diesel emission regulations on diesel imports. 
-VW was tired of the EPA because:

     A.  In europe diesel autos make up over half of    
           all car engines. 
     B.  Cars like the Euro-version VW golf wagon      
           get almost 90 mpg. Compare that to the 
           Toyota Prius that gets 40mpg at best. 
     C.  The EPA doesnt want VW to import a 90    
           MPG diesel car to the US because it would    
           kill US auto sales, so the EPA makes diesel 
           regulations so strict that the only diesels 
           VW et. al. can import only manage 45 MPG. 
     D.  And if you want to make things fair, the 
           highest MPG diesel electric hybrid made by 
           VW gets over 200 MPG. 
     E.  Europeans aren‚Äôt idiots: they aren‚Äôt willingly 
          ‚Äúpoisoning themselves‚Äù with diesel fumes. 
          Diesel is just as clean as gas and burning 
          1 gallon of diesel fuel every 90 miles is 
          better for the environment than burning 1 
          gallon of gas every 30 miles. 
     F.  The ‚Äúsmelly/black fume producing‚Äù 
          reputation of diesel in america owes itself to 
          idiot US auto makers that in the 80‚Äôs tried to 
          make frankenstein diesel engines out of 
          modified gas engines and they ran like shit 
          and spewed black smoke. These atrocities    
          were unlike the clean running diesel engines 
          that were being produced in Germany at the 
          same time. 
-In summary, the EPA has been punishing European Auto makers (VW) for American auto makers‚Äô past engineering disgraces, and when VW officials got tired of being unfairly punished they decided to troll the EPA with an emissions hack. 
-They did it to slam some jimmies, not to gain      
profit or destroy the environment. 
-German authorities know this, which is why they released key players like Oliver Schmidt who was let out on parole right after he was transferred from US prison to German authorities. 
-The loss of stock value that occured from the scandal was unjustified then, and the stagnation of VW stock price since then has been unjustified in light of the fact that VW‚Äôs P/E in the last 3 months has been between 50-70 times lower than that of Tesla, and historically it has been foolish to underestimate the ability of Volkswagen to perform at the cutting edge of the industry. 
-The Emissions hack has nothing negative to say about Volkswagens fierce engineering capability and in my view it has something positive to say about the youthfulness and creativity of the company.

Besides commercial passengers, the company has also generated some revenue by carrying payloads into space in recent years. Assuming that this will grow to about $12 million by 2022, total revenues would stand at $50 million for the year.

3) Revenue Per Share

Revenue Per Share is likely to grow to about $0.21 in 2022, assuming total shares outstanding of 234 million.

4. Value Per Share

$GLD mostly follows real rates and then the $. 

What has allowed $GLD to prosper recently has been :

a) Ever dovish FED decreasing nominal rates as much as they can via their speeches & slower than expected job gains which have cemented FED forecasts

b) Ever rising inflation expectations due to faulty base effects that are transitory

c) Some impact from Crapto crash with money flowing back into $GLD (some of it at least :/)

> Late yesterday, the Fed‚Äôs Quarles said ‚Äúit will become important for the FOMC to begin discussing our plans to adjust the pace of asset purchases at upcoming meetings.‚Äù Quarles is the Fed‚Äôs Vice Chair for Supervision and it is unusual for him to comment on monetary policy.

aBis) The NFP last month was a serious miss but it's not gonna be repeated : as schools reopen and UIs are not extended in a lot of states, the slaves will go back to finding a slave master before jobs run out. employers have also adjusted somewhat with regards to wage expectations already which should make for a much more balanced jobs market going into the begining of school season

b) Inflation (in CPI sense) has peaked in April or will peak now, Commos have crashed thanks to our lords and saviors, the ccp tightening margins and putting an end to this story.

GamesWorkshop produce little plastic toys for grown ups with too much money and no dating life. You know the Warhammer 40k and Warhammer Fantasy IP? Thats what they do. They created that stuff. They sit on one if the most popular franchises that is gettint A LOT of attention these days.

\- the IP¬¥s are gaining traction. Fast. There are so many games comming out theses days that focus on the Warhammer universe, it¬¥s actually insane. If just a fraction of the people playing decide to buy some of these overpriced plastic models GamesWorkshop is making BANK. 

\- The (realtively) new CEO ""gets"" it. His predecessor was a dumb boomer fuck who would not open their IPs for anything besides their own models. But the new guy plays the new media game like a damn fiddle. Since he is in charge the company is running so fucking smooth, it¬¥s insane. They will revive Warhammer Fantasy again (was canceled because of bad management), they plan to produce movies, TV series, they opened a second plant to produce their modells, great games with their IP get released more and more, they are more present on social media, they produce new modells that kick ass, the new IP (Age of Sigmar) that replaced Fantasy actually is great now etc....

With the release of their 9th Warhammer 40k Edition they also released a special starter box (dont worry about the details, you will get the jest in a second). You could preorder it. Because they knew that there was a lot of nerds who wanted to get one of these boxes they produced more of these boxes than of any box previous. Guess what?

It was sold out in 17 minutes. Thats it. The nerds out there are fucking addicted and they want that shit more than crystal meth. And the train is just gaining speed.

Every quarter they blow their earnings report out of the water.

Do you think it is possible that because of that many shorts, a short squeeze like in late january is likely to occure?   
another of my thoughts was, do you think it might be possible that those short sellers are using bots and other ways to manipulate the opinion of the people and the ratings of their new game cyberpunk2077, to make them even worse than they already are?  
like ""spilling gas into the open fire"", to make people hate the company even more and by that making investors panic and sell - and they profit because of their shorts.   


I just wondered, cause everytime i see a post about cd projekt red on twitter lately, the haters will be much faster to comment than the actual fans, what means either there are people who actually intend to spread negativity regarding this company - to make profit - or these people are actually haters who, unknowingly, make short sellers (including even citadel in this case) earn big money.   


To be clear: Of course CD PROJEKT is to be criticized for their actions, and the drop of their stock price might be well deserved. But I hate to think that, the people who profit from that are even much worse than them and that people who claim to hate the bad ""corpos"" and therefore now hate CD PROJEKT, are helping even worse corpos and dont even know that they do

As I read several times there could be the posibibility of maybe hitting a shareprice of several million dollars for either $GME, $AMC or whatever retards are trading with.

Technically there is a maximum amount that can be handled by the Nasdaq since may 17 wich is at 1,844,674,407,370,955.1615 USD

So here we have the maximum price for a hammer super Dupa short squeeze.

And as far as your second question about shorts manipulating public opinion with bots or whatnot... It's actually quite common as well: Heavily short a stock, publish FUD to drive down the price, cash-out, rinse and repeat. HFs do it all the time.",,

EDIT: short TLDR by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can‚Äôt fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It‚Äôs a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \(high short float\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",nlpfk9,UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me

They had a bad report which sent the stock down 50% earlier this year, but recently followed it up with some good data and reports from people in their trials are that their gene therapy produces results.  They will never cure anything, but for kids with muscular distrophy just keeping them from getting worse is as good as a cure.  Cathy Wood took a position and exited it fairly quickly, before the most recent good data.  If they can retrace even half of the move down from earlier this year it would be a big gain.  I think the CEO is universally disliked and should have looked to be an acquisition target a long time ago by one of the big players, but instead was making deals and trying to just do collaborations.

Black berry‚Äôs forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let‚Äôs start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It‚Äôs essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars‚Äô software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla‚Äôs self driving cars, they‚Äôll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It‚Äôs confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It‚Äôs cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That‚Äôs $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

TLDR --Premise-- ViaSat, Inc (VSAT) is a mediocre company that provides mediocre satellite service that costs way too much for what it is.... but in many places it is the ONLY option... well it was until Mr. üöÄ himself decided to eat their lunch. StarLink (part of SpaceX) is about to absolutely destroy VSAT and turn it to üí©.

TLDR --Strategy-- since you can't invest in SpaceX (private company) or Starlink (until it is spun off into a separate entity **and then DO invest there** ) I think someone that decides to buy PUTS on VSAT (give yourself A LOT of time, I'm talking June 2022 $35 or Jan 2023 $25) stands to make a lot of money ------ I'm personally not starting my position until right before the next earnings report in August. I figure the first sign of trouble will come out in an earnings report and if it isn't August then by November it'll start showing. Again **LONG** duration puts. Looking to catch that cycle when the company drops 50% on the bad news. If it goes up between now and then I'll just buy MORE puts. 

**NOT A PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL PERSON - INVEST AT YOUR OWN RISK - I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE BUT I MAY BE ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™ PERSON WHO EATS üí© FOR ALL YOU KNOW**

details

**ViaSat - How it started**

Market cap of 3.26 Billion, share price of $47.55 when I'm writing this. It got as high as the 90's before the pandemic book the shins out of the market and dropped it to $28. Since recovered a bit to... as I said $47.55

They have some satellites in space that allow people with a receiver dish to get internet from space like some kind of awesome scifi movie.... except the internet is crazy expensive for what you get. Their satellites are pretty high up and that means each one can cover a BIG area. They only seem to have a handful, maybe a dozen? But they offer pretty broad coverage and are expanding it. BUT because the satellites are high up the latency (time between your computer and your internet source or something like that) is high leading to slow speeds and overall not a great service.

They already have airlines as customers, expanding recently with Delta. Their is VERY LITTLE competition in this business and between airlines, cruise lines and rural home owners with no other option they make a nice amount of money. Totally solid business model. Internet is ever more and more important and usage on air planes and boats is only gonna go up. In fact like a lot of articles on VSAT I would probably say this is a good medium / long term buy and that is why the median price target is $67 ***EXCEPT*** I know something that the market doesn't seem to have realized yet.

>EDITED BASED ON COMMENTS  
>  
>ViaSat does have commercial business beyond airlines and cruises; I would imagine rural businesses and some VERY LARGE corporations that use it for specific use cases. There is also the DOD which they have contracts with.  
>

>  
>**I AM NOT ASSERTING THAT VIA SAT WILL GO COMPLETELY OUT OF BUSINESS.**  
>  
>  
>  
>However, while a viable company may exist beyond the coming reckoning I expect the market to react extremely negatively to ViaSat losing **ALL** of their rural residential and rural small and medium size business customers. I'm also thinking that right around the time that starts sinking in news stories about cruise lines and air lines switching over to StarLink will start popping up and again, $VSAT go **üí©.** I honestly hope VSAT does go up to the current target of the mid $60's because I'll start buying puts a small chunk at a time as it rises. Until then I'm waiting till August, right before next quarterly earnings report to start my position.

**StarLink - How it's going**

as you may the Dogefather happens to have a small üöÄ company. Its called SpaceX and they aren't publicly traded. They also are doing to the aerospace / orbit supply and transport industry what many of us wish Tesla could fully due to the fossil fuel industry. SpaceX's Falcon9 üöÄ is all sorts of amazing - mainly because it isn't thrown out after each use ($40MM in savings for each subsequent use of a booster).

StarLink is a division of SpaceX that is focused on bringing internet to the whole üåé using a crazy amount of satellites. Like... A LOT. Unlike ViaSat which has a few the StarLink constellation (thats what they call a network of satellites) has 16 HUNDRED and they are launching 60 at a time every week or so (sometimes more than once a week). Because StarLink has access to this game changing super cheap üöÄ transportation AND Musk is doing is usual weirdness by mass producing these satellites and focusing on cost and volume instead of making them SUPER DUPER reliable

Some of you may remember how TSLA was this tiny company that was prob gonna die etc. etc. and THEN üí•üí• there are Model 3's and Model Y's EVERYWHERE. Well StarLink is gonna have that moment soon. Sometime in the next few months there will suddenly be high-ish speed internet (between 50mbs and 100mbs) literally ANYWHERE on the planet for $500 down and $100 a month.

Performance can only be measured through the entire cycle.    The entire Cycle exposes you from all angles. 

The human brain tends to become infected with greed at the end of a big Stage 2 run (see digital  virtuals  for current example) thus causing people to lose money after a bull market because they expect it to go on forever.

  Understanding Stage Analysis can help you overcome this  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bw41ugsodj171.png?width=490&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b63e3098a3c451ed5536be730650feb79008527

So now let's  dig in our today's post and my targets  : 

1-  Silver will enjoy huge capital flows from those digital assets  holders in a time after overcame and understand stage analysis .... who will now seek the silver whale! 

&#x200B;

2- We are in stage 2 for silver  !!! We can expect parabolic moves any time .  

 Opportunity of buying silver cheap and timely is about to end. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  ( gold did it 2020 July ) 

So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN?  

Tic Toc !

&#x200B;

3-  Silver is in a position of strength. US Dollar is in a position of weakness. 

 The final 15% decline in the US Dollar index WILL send silver parabolic!

&#x200B;

4-  The ""silver"" macro tidal wave is picking up steam &will crush all price suppression along the way...  Q2 close will set the stage how fast the insanity picks up.  HOLD ON TIGHT! Easy 56$ and 120$ targets 

This is not financial advice . I hold 1700 ozz of physical silver .",nlt5x7,Understanding Stage Analysis and ready for big explosive moves !

4616,,2021-05-26 23:30:49,t3_nlugr7,,wallstreetbets,"CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer said Wednesday he‚Äôs not sure why any investors are still betting against GameStop and AMC Entertainment, two of the so-called meme stocks popular on Reddit‚Äôs WallStreetBets forum.
.
.
The ‚ÄúMad Money‚Äù host made his comments following a session in which GameStop shares rose almost 16% Wednesday and AMC advanced 19%. The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.
.
.
‚ÄúAnyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,‚Äù Cramer said.
.
.
Despite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC ‚Äî which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming ‚Äî is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.
.
.
But Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.
.
.
Shorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.
.
.
When the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.
.
.
Both GameStop and AMC have over 20% of their float shares sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. That‚Äôs compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock.
.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like this: a group of buyers with no sensitivity to price,‚Äù Cramer said. ‚ÄúThese people don‚Äôt have unlimited firepower, but they‚Äôve got enough firepower to engineer a short-squeeze any time a bunch of professionals decide to bet against this thing.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt want to share with you something that you all heard so many times (yep, I haven't lost my fate in humanity) like avoid margin trading or invest in mutual funds. I believe I have some wisdom I wish I had from the beginning.

1. Trading is just 5% theory and 95% about emotional control, risk and money management, overcoming one‚Äôs greed, having strict stoploss and targets predefined before taking a trade.
2. Don‚Äôt follow advice from forums blindly. Build your own map of the world. Each of us learn to trade at our own pace and don‚Äôt get discouraged if you find that after a few years, you‚Äôre still struggling to master the ‚Äòmoney game‚Äô. You can keep in mind different advice from experienced players (e.g. I recommend this qooore app and it's discord community), *but it's vital for the final decision to be yours*.
3. Accept losses and do not make investment decisions based on emotion Especially greed, fear, or panic. Yep, you didn‚Äôt buy Betcoin (lol couldn't resist) at 3,000$ because you didn‚Äôt know back than what direction the price would take. No regrets. Keep yourself focused on here and now, move ahead
4. Know yourself. What is your current financial situation? Why you are investing? For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully.
5. Never forget that for investing, time is your best friend - and greed is your worst enemy. Patience is a requirement in stock trading. There are no short-cuts or ‚Äòholy grail‚Äô when it comes to stock. And you only need to have couple of strategies but those should be well tested and made perfect over the period of time.

To me, trading is a skill that requires 3Ls - ‚ÄòLife-Long Learning‚Äù.

Stay humble, be honest and willing to admit your mistakes in trading and don‚Äôt try to rationalise and explain mistakes away, and always remain teachable and never think you‚Äôve ‚Äòarrived‚Äô.",nlvay0,After 3 years of learning investment: my 5 tips for those who just started

4625,,2021-05-27 01:00:08,t3_nlw3ty,,wallstreetbets,"Hi Everyone! I did some research on cinema stocks a while back and made a video on it. I didn't post the content here so I thought I would share it as I know everyone is interested in AMC at the moment! I know it's a lot to read so if you prefer to watch the video, the link for that is also included below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s)

Why Cinema Stocks like AMC will benefit from reopening? 

Time-Frame: Cinema‚Äôs will benefit from reopening and the economic recovery that is occurring all over the world. Especially over a longer timeframe.  I think that Cinemas can be a good trade in the medium term and can help you make money. It‚Äôs all dependent on data and how quickly things go back to normal, but my timeframe on this trade right now is 1-2 years. Maybe even shorter, perhaps 6 months if we bounce back very quickly. Maybe not the most likely, but still a possible scenario that I have to consider. 

&#x200B;

Thesis: 

1)  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a very strong negative impact on the cinema sector. So, naturally as things reopen and vaccinations increase all over North America, these companies stand to benefit. If we look back from the end of January 2020 to the end of April 2021, Marcus Corporation was down approximately 33% from January 27th, 2020. Cinemark is down approximately 35% over the same time period, while National CineMedia is down almost 42% and AMC is up almost 57%. Price is an important factor to consider when buying and selling stocks and this something that is important to consider 

2) Cinemas have suffered tremendously with the Covid-19 pandemic, which makes the cinema sector intriguing as the world re-opens. If we look to Asia, especially China and Japan, where Covid-19 cases subsided and theatres reopened, things look promising.  There was a substantial increase in demand, with demand actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. In China, December 2020 ticket sales at IMAX‚Äôs big-screen theatres jumped 28 per cent from a year earlier, while in Japan, they broke daily records and a record number of people saw movies on the first weekend of January 2021. Clearly, there was a lot of pent-up demand which surfaced and benefitted movie theatres in Asia. 

3) And you know what I‚Äôve seen this film before. Last year early in February, there was a sudden spike in downloads of the Zoom app in China, and the stock at that was point already doing well, up roughly 30 percent from the start of the year. But this spike in Zoom usage soon spread all over the world, and the rest is history. It was an absolutely humungous winner last year. There are obviously sector wide risks with consumer preferences changing, and more and more people preferring to watch films at home. The increase in Netflix & streaming service subscribers over the years is a clear indication of consumer preferences going-forward, but I do like movie theatres as a trade. There is a lot of pent-up demand that I feel will benefit the sector. 

Risks: 

\-  One of the main risks that that most people who are considering trading or investing in cinema companies have, is the risk from Netflix and the other streaming services. Really the risk of the Direct-to-consumer approach and the effects that it will have on the cinema companies. And this is a valid concern because it has reduced demand for cinemas over the last decade. Even some of the biggest filmmakers in the world are turning to it, like Martin Scorsese, Noah Baumbach and Alfonso Cuaron.  Netflix has become the biggest movie studio in the world, at-least when it comes to volume in terms of production over the last several years. And now they plan to release 50-60 films per year, and with their pioneering Direct to Consumer approach, the film industry has changed. Cinemas are no longer at the forefront, and the Direct-to-Consumer strategy is quickly becoming the new incumbent. The DTC approach is taking over, with all the streaming services that have launched. They have taken market share from linear television and have steered consumers away from traditional Cinema.

Catalysts & Conclusion: 

1) However, I still think there is still a place for theatres, even with streaming, especially looking at the same timeframe that I‚Äôm focusing on for this trade. I think now more so than ever people want to be outside. These businesses will benefit from the change in near term consumer trends, with everyone wanting to leave the house. I really believe that the cinema sector is going to do well in North America. If Asia is anything to go by and I think it is, some of the companies involved in the sector have the potential to be great trades. People still want to go to the cinemas, especially when it comes to seeing some of the big budget films that are really made for the big screen. Blockbuster action films with awesome effects are really meant to be seen in a movie theatre in my opinion. The effects and the environment simply cannot be replicated at home. Especially when it comes to immersive experience films, like those with IMAX and 4DX. I really enjoy the cinema and think there is something to be said for being in a big space in a dark room watching a film 40 feet across. It is wonderful to sit in the comfort of your own home but there is just something to be said for having a community experience in a room. But that‚Äôs neither there nor here. 

  
2) Moving on, another potential catalyst is the potential for collaboration between theatre chains and streaming services. Netflix was the one to pioneer the Direct to Consumer, but interestingly they have begun releasing some Netflix Originals on the big screen in recent years. Films like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes all premiered in Cinemas prior to their appearance in Netflix‚Äôs online catalogue.  This is a really interesting move on their part, especially from an investment perspective. Because, while you can watch streaming services in the comfort of your own home, movie theatre companies are open to the idea of having the films that are produced by the streaming services shown in their theatres. Cinemark has shown Netflix movies in theatres in the past, and there is an off chance that they expand their agreement. This wouldn‚Äôt just apply to Cinemark but other theatre chains as well potentially. The big hold-up between the streaming services and theatre chains was the disagreement on the length of theatrical window. But last year, Universal Studios and Cinemark, AMC & Cineplex agreed to a shortened exclusive window, from 74 days to 31 days for major films, as defined by box-office domestic revenue. This makes it more likely that Netflix and other streaming services can find middle ground with the cinema companies. It‚Äôs not all that important a catalyst for the trade, nor is it all that likely, but it is still intriguing and something to consider.

3) A more important catalyst is the release of the next James Bond film, no time to die next year. I‚Äôm really excited about the movie because I‚Äôm a huge James Bond fan. It‚Äôs probably my favourite movie series. And you know what, I‚Äôm not alone. It‚Äôs very popular all over the world. The previous James Bond film, Spectre, grossed nearly $879 million. No Time To Die has been postponed several times due to the pandemic and is due to premiere on October 8th in the United States. I‚Äôm really excited about the movie and will be sure to see in theatres provided it‚Äôs safe to do so. And I think it will be. This movie is really important for the movie theatres because they have been starved and there have just been very few films to show. They have been supply constrained with the lack of new films. No Time To Die is a certain blockbuster and will really help benefit the sector. 

4) Something else that has me really excited is the recent CDC news in the US, with them updating guidance on April 2nd that fully vaccinated people can travel internationally safely and don‚Äôt need to quarantine when they return provided, they test negative within three to five days of their return. They have to test negative before they are allowed to board a return flight to the US. This is really exciting, and this combined with the idea of a vaccine passport as has been proposed by cruise lines and the UK government really provide a lot of momentum for the cinema companies.

4626,,2021-05-27 01:24:58,t3_nlwjwy,,wallstreetbets,"I will try to keep this short and sweet.
In my view the following points are justifiable:
-The VW emissions hack was not an effort to destroy the environment. 
-It was trolling done by VW officials bc they were tired of having the EPA‚Äôs pozzed dick in their asses regarding diesel emission regulations on diesel imports. 
-VW was tired of the EPA because:

     A.  In europe diesel autos make up over half of    
           all car engines. 
     B.  Cars like the Euro-version VW golf wagon      
           get almost 90 mpg. Compare that to the 
           Toyota Prius that gets 40mpg at best. 
     C.  The EPA doesnt want VW to import a 90    
           MPG diesel car to the US because it would    
           kill US auto sales, so the EPA makes diesel 
           regulations so strict that the only diesels 
           VW et. al. can import only manage 45 MPG. 
     D.  And if you want to make things fair, the 
           highest MPG diesel electric hybrid made by 
           VW gets over 200 MPG. 
     E.  Europeans aren‚Äôt idiots: they aren‚Äôt willingly 
          ‚Äúpoisoning themselves‚Äù with diesel fumes. 
          Diesel is just as clean as gas and burning 
          1 gallon of diesel fuel every 90 miles is 
          better for the environment than burning 1 
          gallon of gas every 30 miles. 
     F.  The ‚Äúsmelly/black fume producing‚Äù 
          reputation of diesel in america owes itself to 
          idiot US auto makers that in the 80‚Äôs tried to 
          make frankenstein diesel engines out of 
          modified gas engines and they ran like shit 
          and spewed black smoke. These atrocities    
          were unlike the clean running diesel engines 
          that were being produced in Germany at the 
          same time. 
-In summary, the EPA has been punishing European Auto makers (VW) for American auto makers‚Äô past engineering disgraces, and when VW officials got tired of being unfairly punished they decided to troll the EPA with an emissions hack. 
-They did it to slam some jimmies, not to gain      
profit or destroy the environment. 
-German authorities know this, which is why they released key players like Oliver Schmidt who was let out on parole right after he was transferred from US prison to German authorities. 
-The loss of stock value that occured from the scandal was unjustified then, and the stagnation of VW stock price since then has been unjustified in light of the fact that VW‚Äôs P/E in the last 3 months has been between 50-70 times lower than that of Tesla, and historically it has been foolish to underestimate the ability of Volkswagen to perform at the cutting edge of the industry. 
-The Emissions hack has nothing negative to say about Volkswagens fierce engineering capability and in my view it has something positive to say about the youthfulness and creativity of the company.

b) Ever rising inflation expectations due to faulty base effects that are transitory

\- The (realtively) new CEO ""gets"" it. His predecessor was a dumb boomer fuck who would not open their IPs for anything besides their own models. But the new guy plays the new media game like a damn fiddle. Since he is in charge the company is running so fucking smooth, it¬¥s insane. They will revive Warhammer Fantasy again (was canceled because of bad management), they plan to produce movies, TV series, they opened a second plant to produce their modells, great games with their IP get released more and more, they are more present on social media, they produce new modells that kick ass, the new IP (Age of Sigmar) that replaced Fantasy actually is great now etc....

With the release of their 9th Warhammer 40k Edition they also released a special starter box (dont worry about the details, you will get the jest in a second). You could preorder it. Because they knew that there was a lot of nerds who wanted to get one of these boxes they produced more of these boxes than of any box previous. Guess what?

It was sold out in 17 minutes. Thats it. The nerds out there are fucking addicted and they want that shit more than crystal meth. And the train is just gaining speed.

Do you think it is possible that because of that many shorts, a short squeeze like in late january is likely to occure?   
another of my thoughts was, do you think it might be possible that those short sellers are using bots and other ways to manipulate the opinion of the people and the ratings of their new game cyberpunk2077, to make them even worse than they already are?  
like ""spilling gas into the open fire"", to make people hate the company even more and by that making investors panic and sell - and they profit because of their shorts.   


I just wondered, cause everytime i see a post about cd projekt red on twitter lately, the haters will be much faster to comment than the actual fans, what means either there are people who actually intend to spread negativity regarding this company - to make profit - or these people are actually haters who, unknowingly, make short sellers (including even citadel in this case) earn big money.   


To be clear: Of course CD PROJEKT is to be criticized for their actions, and the drop of their stock price might be well deserved. But I hate to think that, the people who profit from that are even much worse than them and that people who claim to hate the bad ""corpos"" and therefore now hate CD PROJEKT, are helping even worse corpos and dont even know that they do  


Id like to know if I sound crazy or not, cause i am relatively new to investing, let me know your opinions",nm3sdh,Even more short sellings on CD PROJEKT RED

Seems this is the MGM entertainment division...its selling in the basement of my TD Ameritrade account on the  ""Grey Market"" (that don't sound to reassuring)  @ $80 a share.

I've read that in older deals if you buy the stock in the old company when the deal is made you can get a piece of the parent company...

Is this a 9D Chess move to get some part of  the $3K plus Amazon stock in the near future for $80?

As I read several times there could be the posibibility of maybe hitting a shareprice of several million dollars for either $GME, $AMC or whatever retards are trading with.

Technically there is a maximum amount that can be handled by the Nasdaq since may 17 wich is at 1,844,674,407,370,955.1615 USD

So here we have the maximum price for a hammer super Dupa short squeeze.

EDIT: short TLDR by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can‚Äôt fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It‚Äôs a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \(high short float\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",nlpfk9,UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me

They will never cure anything, but for kids with muscular distrophy just keeping them from getting worse is as good as a cure.  Cathy Wood took a position and exited it fairly quickly, before the most recent good data.  If they can retrace even half of the move down from earlier this year it would be a big gain.  I think the CEO is universally disliked and should have looked to be an acquisition target a long time ago by one of the big players, but instead was making deals and trying to just do collaborations.

Black berry‚Äôs forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let‚Äôs start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It‚Äôs essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars‚Äô software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla‚Äôs self driving cars, they‚Äôll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It‚Äôs confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It‚Äôs cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That‚Äôs $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

TLDR --Premise-- ViaSat, Inc (VSAT) is a mediocre company that provides mediocre satellite service that costs way too much for what it is.... but in many places it is the ONLY option... well it was until Mr. üöÄ himself decided to eat their lunch. StarLink (part of SpaceX) is about to absolutely destroy VSAT and turn it to üí©.

TLDR --Strategy-- since you can't invest in SpaceX (private company) or Starlink (until it is spun off into a separate entity **and then DO invest there** ) I think someone that decides to buy PUTS on VSAT (give yourself A LOT of time, I'm talking June 2022 $35 or Jan 2023 $25) stands to make a lot of money ------ I'm personally not starting my position until right before the next earnings report in August. I figure the first sign of trouble will come out in an earnings report and if it isn't August then by November it'll start showing. Again **LONG** duration puts. Looking to catch that cycle when the company drops 50% on the bad news. If it goes up between now and then I'll just buy MORE puts. 

**NOT A PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL PERSON - INVEST AT YOUR OWN RISK - I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE BUT I MAY BE ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™ PERSON WHO EATS üí© FOR ALL YOU KNOW**

details

**ViaSat - How it started**

Market cap of 3.26 Billion, share price of $47.55 when I'm writing this. It got as high as the 90's before the pandemic book the shins out of the market and dropped it to $28. Since recovered a bit to... as I said $47.55

They have some satellites in space that allow people with a receiver dish to get internet from space like some kind of awesome scifi movie.... except the internet is crazy expensive for what you get. Their satellites are pretty high up and that means each one can cover a BIG area. They only seem to have a handful, maybe a dozen? But they offer pretty broad coverage and are expanding it. BUT because the satellites are high up the latency (time between your computer and your internet source or something like that) is high leading to slow speeds and overall not a great service.

They already have airlines as customers, expanding recently with Delta. Their is VERY LITTLE competition in this business and between airlines, cruise lines and rural home owners with no other option they make a nice amount of money. Totally solid business model. Internet is ever more and more important and usage on air planes and boats is only gonna go up. In fact like a lot of articles on VSAT I would probably say this is a good medium / long term buy and that is why the median price target is $67 ***EXCEPT*** I know something that the market doesn't seem to have realized yet.

>EDITED BASED ON COMMENTS  
>  
>ViaSat does have commercial business beyond airlines and cruises; I would imagine rural businesses and some VERY LARGE corporations that use it for specific use cases. There is also the DOD which they have contracts with.  
>  
>  
>  
>**I AM NOT ASSERTING THAT VIA SAT WILL GO COMPLETELY OUT OF BUSINESS.**  
>  
>  
>  
>However, while a viable company may exist beyond the coming reckoning I expect the market to react extremely negatively to ViaSat losing **ALL** of their rural residential and rural small and medium size business customers. I'm also thinking that right around the time that starts sinking in news stories about cruise lines and air lines switching over to StarLink will start popping up and again, $VSAT go **üí©.** I honestly hope VSAT does go up to the current target of the mid $60's because I'll start buying puts a small chunk at a time as it rises. Until then I'm waiting till August, right before next quarterly earnings report to start my position.

**StarLink - How it's going**

as you may the Dogefather happens to have a small üöÄ company. Its called SpaceX and they aren't publicly traded. They also are doing to the aerospace / orbit supply and transport industry what many of us wish Tesla could fully due to the fossil fuel industry. SpaceX's Falcon9 üöÄ is all sorts of amazing - mainly because it isn't thrown out after each use ($40MM in savings for each subsequent use of a booster).

StarLink is a division of SpaceX that is focused on bringing internet to the whole üåé using a crazy amount of satellites. Like... A LOT. Unlike ViaSat which has a few the StarLink constellation (thats what they call a network of satellites) has 16 HUNDRED and they are launching 60 at a time every week or so (sometimes more than once a week). Because StarLink has access to this game changing super cheap üöÄ transportation AND Musk is doing is usual weirdness by mass producing these satellites and focusing on cost and volume instead of making them SUPER DUPER reliable

Some of you may remember how TSLA was this tiny company that was prob gonna die etc. etc. and THEN üí•üí• there are Model 3's and Model Y's EVERYWHERE. Well StarLink is gonna have that moment soon. Sometime in the next few months there will suddenly be high-ish speed internet (between 50mbs and 100mbs) literally ANYWHERE on the planet for $500 down and $100 a month.

Performance can only be measured through the entire cycle.    The entire Cycle exposes you from all angles. 

The human brain tends to become infected with greed at the end of a big Stage 2 run (see digital  virtuals  for current example) thus causing people to lose money after a bull market because they expect it to go on forever.

  Understanding Stage Analysis can help you overcome this  

&#x200B;

So now let's  dig in our today's post and my targets  : 

1-  Silver will enjoy huge capital flows from those digital assets  holders in a time after overcame and understand stage analysis .... who will now seek the silver whale! 

&#x200B;

2- We are in stage 2 for silver  !!! We can expect parabolic moves any time .  

 Opportunity of buying silver cheap and timely is about to end. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  ( gold did it 2020 July ) 

So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN?  

Tic Toc !

&#x200B;

3-  Silver is in a position of strength. US Dollar is in a position of weakness. 

 The final 15% decline in the US Dollar index WILL send silver parabolic!

&#x200B;

4-  The ""silver"" macro tidal wave is picking up steam &will crush all price suppression along the way...  Q2 close will set the stage how fast the insanity picks up.  HOLD ON TIGHT! Easy 56$ and 120$ targets 

This is not financial advice . I hold 1700 ozz of physical silver .",nlt5x7,Understanding Stage Analysis and ready for big explosive moves !

4960,,2021-05-26 23:30:49,t3_nlugr7,,wallstreetbets,"CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer said Wednesday he‚Äôs not sure why any investors are still betting against GameStop and AMC Entertainment, two of the so-called meme stocks popular on Reddit‚Äôs WallStreetBets forum.
.
.
The ‚ÄúMad Money‚Äù host made his comments following a session in which GameStop shares rose almost 16% Wednesday and AMC advanced 19%. The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.
.
.
‚ÄúAnyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,‚Äù Cramer said.
.
.
Despite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC ‚Äî which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming ‚Äî is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.
.
.
But Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.
.
.
Shorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.
.
.
When the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.
.
.
Both GameStop and AMC have over 20% of their float shares sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. That‚Äôs compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock.
.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like this: a group of buyers with no sensitivity to price,‚Äù Cramer said. ‚ÄúThese people don‚Äôt have unlimited firepower, but they‚Äôve got enough firepower to engineer a short-squeeze any time a bunch of professionals decide to bet against this thing.‚Äù

1. Trading is just 5% theory and 95% about emotional control, risk and money management, overcoming one‚Äôs greed, having strict stoploss and targets predefined before taking a trade.
2. Don‚Äôt follow advice from forums blindly. Build your own map of the world. Each of us learn to trade at our own pace and don‚Äôt get discouraged if you find that after a few years, you‚Äôre still struggling to master the ‚Äòmoney game‚Äô. You can keep in mind different advice from experienced players (e.g. I recommend this qooore app and it's discord community), *but it's vital for the final decision to be yours*.
3. Accept losses and do not make investment decisions based on emotion Especially greed, fear, or panic. Yep, you didn‚Äôt buy Betcoin (lol couldn't resist) at 3,000$ because you didn‚Äôt know back than what direction the price would take. No regrets. Keep yourself focused on here and now, move ahead
4. Know yourself. What is your current financial situation? Why you are investing? For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully.
5. Never forget that for investing, time is your best friend - and greed is your worst enemy. Patience is a requirement in stock trading. There are no short-cuts or ‚Äòholy grail‚Äô when it comes to stock. And you only need to have couple of strategies but those should be well tested and made perfect over the period of time.

To me, trading is a skill that requires 3Ls - ‚ÄòLife-Long Learning‚Äù.

Stay humble, be honest and willing to admit your mistakes in trading and don‚Äôt try to rationalise and explain mistakes away, and always remain teachable and never think you‚Äôve ‚Äòarrived‚Äô.",nlvay0,After 3 years of learning investment: my 5 tips for those who just started

4969,,2021-05-27 01:00:08,t3_nlw3ty,,wallstreetbets,"Hi Everyone! I did some research on cinema stocks a while back and made a video on it. I didn't post the content here so I thought I would share it as I know everyone is interested in AMC at the moment! I know it's a lot to read so if you prefer to watch the video, the link for that is also included below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s)

Why Cinema Stocks like AMC will benefit from reopening? 

Time-Frame: Cinema‚Äôs will benefit from reopening and the economic recovery that is occurring all over the world. Especially over a longer timeframe.  I think that Cinemas can be a good trade in the medium term and can help you make money. It‚Äôs all dependent on data and how quickly things go back to normal, but my timeframe on this trade right now is 1-2 years. Maybe even shorter, perhaps 6 months if we bounce back very quickly. Maybe not the most likely, but still a possible scenario that I have to consider. 

&#x200B;

Thesis: 

1)  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a very strong negative impact on the cinema sector. So, naturally as things reopen and vaccinations increase all over North America, these companies stand to benefit. If we look back from the end of January 2020 to the end of April 2021, Marcus Corporation was down approximately 33% from January 27th, 2020. Cinemark is down approximately 35% over the same time period, while National CineMedia is down almost 42% and AMC is up almost 57%. Price is an important factor to consider when buying and selling stocks and this something that is important to consider 

2) Cinemas have suffered tremendously with the Covid-19 pandemic, which makes the cinema sector intriguing as the world re-opens. If we look to Asia, especially China and Japan, where Covid-19 cases subsided and theatres reopened, things look promising.  There was a substantial increase in demand, with demand actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. In China, December 2020 ticket sales at IMAX‚Äôs big-screen theatres jumped 28 per cent from a year earlier, while in Japan, they broke daily records and a record number of people saw movies on the first weekend of January 2021. Clearly, there was a lot of pent-up demand which surfaced and benefitted movie theatres in Asia. 

3) And you know what I‚Äôve seen this film before. Last year early in February, there was a sudden spike in downloads of the Zoom app in China, and the stock at that was point already doing well, up roughly 30 percent from the start of the year. But this spike in Zoom usage soon spread all over the world, and the rest is history. It was an absolutely humungous winner last year. There are obviously sector wide risks with consumer preferences changing, and more and more people preferring to watch films at home. The increase in Netflix & streaming service subscribers over the years is a clear indication of consumer preferences going-forward, but I do like movie theatres as a trade. There is a lot of pent-up demand that I feel will benefit the sector. 

Risks: 

\-  One of the main risks that that most people who are considering trading or investing in cinema companies have, is the risk from Netflix and the other streaming services. Really the risk of the Direct-to-consumer approach and the effects that it will have on the cinema companies. And this is a valid concern because it has reduced demand for cinemas over the last decade. Even some of the biggest filmmakers in the world are turning to it, like Martin Scorsese, Noah Baumbach and Alfonso Cuaron.  Netflix has become the biggest movie studio in the world, at-least when it comes to volume in terms of production over the last several years. And now they plan to release 50-60 films per year, and with their pioneering Direct to Consumer approach, the film industry has changed. Cinemas are no longer at the forefront, and the Direct-to-Consumer strategy is quickly becoming the new incumbent. The DTC approach is taking over, with all the streaming services that have launched. They have taken market share from linear television and have steered consumers away from traditional Cinema.

Catalysts & Conclusion: 

1) However, I still think there is still a place for theatres, even with streaming, especially looking at the same timeframe that I‚Äôm focusing on for this trade. I think now more so than ever people want to be outside. These businesses will benefit from the change in near term consumer trends, with everyone wanting to leave the house. I really believe that the cinema sector is going to do well in North America. If Asia is anything to go by and I think it is, some of the companies involved in the sector have the potential to be great trades. People still want to go to the cinemas, especially when it comes to seeing some of the big budget films that are really made for the big screen. Blockbuster action films with awesome effects are really meant to be seen in a movie theatre in my opinion. The effects and the environment simply cannot be replicated at home. Especially when it comes to immersive experience films, like those with IMAX and 4DX. I really enjoy the cinema and think there is something to be said for being in a big space in a dark room watching a film 40 feet across. It is wonderful to sit in the comfort of your own home but there is just something to be said for having a community experience in a room. But that‚Äôs neither there nor here. 

  
2) Moving on, another potential catalyst is the potential for collaboration between theatre chains and streaming services. Netflix was the one to pioneer the Direct to Consumer, but interestingly they have begun releasing some Netflix Originals on the big screen in recent years. Films like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes all premiered in Cinemas prior to their appearance in Netflix‚Äôs online catalogue.  This is a really interesting move on their part, especially from an investment perspective. Because, while you can watch streaming services in the comfort of your own home, movie theatre companies are open to the idea of having the films that are produced by the streaming services shown in their theatres. Cinemark has shown Netflix movies in theatres in the past, and there is an off chance that they expand their agreement. This wouldn‚Äôt just apply to Cinemark but other theatre chains as well potentially. The big hold-up between the streaming services and theatre chains was the disagreement on the length of theatrical window. But last year, Universal Studios and Cinemark, AMC & Cineplex agreed to a shortened exclusive window, from 74 days to 31 days for major films, as defined by box-office domestic revenue. This makes it more likely that Netflix and other streaming services can find middle ground with the cinema companies. It‚Äôs not all that important a catalyst for the trade, nor is it all that likely, but it is still intriguing and something to consider.

3) A more important catalyst is the release of the next James Bond film, no time to die next year. I‚Äôm really excited about the movie because I‚Äôm a huge James Bond fan. It‚Äôs probably my favourite movie series. And you know what, I‚Äôm not alone. It‚Äôs very popular all over the world. The previous James Bond film, Spectre, grossed nearly $879 million. No Time To Die has been postponed several times due to the pandemic and is due to premiere on October 8th in the United States. I‚Äôm really excited about the movie and will be sure to see in theatres provided it‚Äôs safe to do so. And I think it will be. This movie is really important for the movie theatres because they have been starved and there have just been very few films to show. They have been supply constrained with the lack of new films. No Time To Die is a certain blockbuster and will really help benefit the sector. 

4) Something else that has me really excited is the recent CDC news in the US, with them updating guidance on April 2nd that fully vaccinated people can travel internationally safely and don‚Äôt need to quarantine when they return provided, they test negative within three to five days of their return. They have to test negative before they are allowed to board a return flight to the US. This is really exciting, and this combined with the idea of a vaccine passport as has been proposed by cruise lines and the UK government really provide a lot of momentum for the cinema companies.

4970,,2021-05-27 01:24:58,t3_nlwjwy,,wallstreetbets,"I will try to keep this short and sweet.
In my view the following points are justifiable:
-The VW emissions hack was not an effort to destroy the environment. 
-It was trolling done by VW officials bc they were tired of having the EPA‚Äôs pozzed dick in their asses regarding diesel emission regulations on diesel imports. 
-VW was tired of the EPA because:

     A.  In europe diesel autos make up over half of    
           all car engines. 
     B.  Cars like the Euro-version VW golf wagon      
           get almost 90 mpg. Compare that to the 
           Toyota Prius that gets 40mpg at best. 
     C.  The EPA doesnt want VW to import a 90    
           MPG diesel car to the US because it would    
           kill US auto sales, so the EPA makes diesel 
           regulations so strict that the only diesels 
           VW et. al. can import only manage 45 MPG. 
     D.  And if you want to make things fair, the 
           highest MPG diesel electric hybrid made by 
           VW gets over 200 MPG. 
     E.  Europeans aren‚Äôt idiots: they aren‚Äôt willingly 
          ‚Äúpoisoning themselves‚Äù with diesel fumes. 
          Diesel is just as clean as gas and burning 
          1 gallon of diesel fuel every 90 miles is 
          better for the environment than burning 1 
          gallon of gas every 30 miles. 
     F.  The ‚Äúsmelly/black fume producing‚Äù 
          reputation of diesel in america owes itself to 
          idiot US auto makers that in the 80‚Äôs tried to 
          make frankenstein diesel engines out of 
          modified gas engines and they ran like shit 
          and spewed black smoke. These atrocities    
          were unlike the clean running diesel engines 
          that were being produced in Germany at the 
          same time. 
-In summary, the EPA has been punishing European Auto makers (VW) for American auto makers‚Äô past engineering disgraces, and when VW officials got tired of being unfairly punished they decided to troll the EPA with an emissions hack. 
-They did it to slam some jimmies, not to gain      
profit or destroy the environment. 
-German authorities know this, which is why they released key players like Oliver Schmidt who was let out on parole right after he was transferred from US prison to German authorities. 
-The loss of stock value that occured from the scandal was unjustified then, and the stagnation of VW stock price since then has been unjustified in light of the fact that VW‚Äôs P/E in the last 3 months has been between 50-70 times lower than that of Tesla, and historically it has been foolish to underestimate the ability of Volkswagen to perform at the cutting edge of the industry. 
-The Emissions hack has nothing negative to say about Volkswagens fierce engineering capability and in my view it has something positive to say about the youthfulness and creativity of the company.

b) Ever rising inflation expectations due to faulty base effects that are transitory

I know that you are a bunch of inbred retards like myself. And I present to you the most autistic and lowkey genius play out there,

***GamesWorkshop***

**What are they doing?**

GamesWorkshop produce little plastic toys for grown ups with too much money and no dating life. You know the Warhammer 40k and Warhammer Fantasy IP? Thats what they do. They created that stuff. They sit on one if the most popular franchises that is gettint A LOT of attention these days. 

**Why should you care?**

GamesWorkshop is a pretty old company. And it sucked major balls for decades. 

The stock rose 62,9% during the last 12 months. Why should we care now? 

BECAUSE NOW IS THE TIME TO BELIEVE 

Reasons why I¬¥m EXTREMELY BULLISH:

\- the IP¬¥s are gaining traction. Fast. There are so many games comming out theses days that focus on the Warhammer universe, it¬¥s actually insane. If just a fraction of the people playing decide to buy some of these overpriced plastic models GamesWorkshop is making BANK. 

\- The (realtively) new CEO ""gets"" it. His predecessor was a dumb boomer fuck who would not open their IPs for anything besides their own models. But the new guy plays the new media game like a damn fiddle. Since he is in charge the company is running so fucking smooth, it¬¥s insane. They will revive Warhammer Fantasy again (was canceled because of bad management), they plan to produce movies, TV series, they opened a second plant to produce their modells, great games with their IP get released more and more, they are more present on social media, they produce new modells that kick ass, the new IP (Age of Sigmar) that replaced Fantasy actually is great now etc....

With the release of their 9th Warhammer 40k Edition they also released a special starter box (dont worry about the details, you will get the jest in a second). You could preorder it. Because they knew that there was a lot of nerds who wanted to get one of these boxes they produced more of these boxes than of any box previous. Guess what?

It was sold out in 17 minutes. Thats it. The nerds out there are fucking addicted and they want that shit more than crystal meth. And the train is just gaining speed.

Every quarter they blow their earnings report out of the water.

Corona? Made them stronger. Brexit? Didn¬¥t matter.

This company is the equivalent of the ugly nerd in highschool that got jacked and fucks your wife when he is in college. 

Get in there. This thing will blow up. 

The Emperor protects.

[https://rss.knf.gov.pl/RssOuterView/faces/start2OuterView.xhtml](https://rss.knf.gov.pl/RssOuterView/faces/start2OuterView.xhtml) \-> head to current positions  


Do you think it is possible that because of that many shorts, a short squeeze like in late january is likely to occure?   
another of my thoughts was, do you think it might be possible that those short sellers are using bots and other ways to manipulate the opinion of the people and the ratings of their new game cyberpunk2077, to make them even worse than they already are?  
like ""spilling gas into the open fire"", to make people hate the company even more and by that making investors panic and sell - and they profit because of their shorts.   


I just wondered, cause everytime i see a post about cd projekt red on twitter lately, the haters will be much faster to comment than the actual fans, what means either there are people who actually intend to spread negativity regarding this company - to make profit - or these people are actually haters who, unknowingly, make short sellers (including even citadel in this case) earn big money.   


To be clear: Of course CD PROJEKT is to be criticized for their actions, and the drop of their stock price might be well deserved. But I hate to think that, the people who profit from that are even much worse than them and that people who claim to hate the bad ""corpos"" and therefore now hate CD PROJEKT, are helping even worse corpos and dont even know that they do  


Id like to know if I sound crazy or not, cause i am relatively new to investing, let me know your opinions",nm3sdh,Even more short sellings on CD PROJEKT RED

Seems this is the MGM entertainment division...its selling in the basement of my TD Ameritrade account on the  ""Grey Market"" (that don't sound to reassuring)  @ $80 a share.

I've read that in older deals if you buy the stock in the old company when the deal is made you can get a piece of the parent company...

3. We are not insensitive to price. When it goes up, that means that all the rest of our shares are worth more, when it goes down, we can get more for cheaper. Win, win. Average up, average down. It matters not. 
4. We don‚Äôt need infinite ammo to hold.
5. We are not a buying group. I don‚Äôt think that you even know what that is. Each and everyone of us buys for his/her own reason.

He‚Äôs also smart enough to have a rough idea of how the tumbling of the house of cards can topple the entire economy. In fact, he likely knows that they‚Äôre counting on the federal government to intervene before that happens, much like 2008. 

This is his ‚Äúpublic plea‚Äù so that in a few months from now, he can say he tried to warn everyone that the shorts were playing a dangerous game.",,

**What I'm doing**: Averaging in slowly in preparation for the 10D EMA to come in in preparation for another leg higher.

Market

* **The RPA Market is growing rapidly**: GVR estimates the global robotic process automation market to grow at 34% CAGR through 2028 while Gartner estimates it to grow at over 24% YoY CAGR - to $600B, through 2022 ([source](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-28-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-hyperautomation-enabling-software-market-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-by-2022)) and expects $PATH to grow at 33% CAGR ([source](https://www.uipath.com/resources/automation-analyst-reports/gartner-magic-quadrant-robotic-process-automation))
* **$PATH dominates the most important regions for RPA**: North America (accounts for 37% of global RPA spend ([source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/robotic-process-automation-rpa-market)) and as of January¬†31, 2021, $PATH had 7,968¬†customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 63% of the Fortune Global 500 ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_9))

Company & Financials

* **$PATH can expect high levels of current customer retention**: UiPath has an NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 71 over the past 12 mo period, lightyears beyond the industry average of 39 ([Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_4), [Source](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/))
* **Strong revenue growth:** $PATH is experiencing YoY Revenue growth of over 80%
* **Strong profitability growth:** While $PATH grows revenues at over 80% YoY, their cost of revenue only grows at \~13% YoY. EBITDA Margin is growing at 88% YoY - $PATH will begin capturing large profits in the next year ([source](https://app.koyfin.com/fa/fa.is/eq-08u9m6))

TA & Entry

* $PATH has consolidated off it's IPO highs
* $PATH has tested these highs multiple times and is forming a nice support

Sup, WSB folks!

It‚Äôs Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I‚Äôm the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we‚Äôll take a look at the superior stonk‚Äòs current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‚Äòs fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF‚Äôs GF‚Äôs ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to üêª in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation).

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices. I know many people who want to travel but few who want to buy stock.**",nlmxyt,How to profit from the final stages of Coronavirus

5690,,2021-05-26 17:48:02,t3_nlmzdx,,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

5691,,2021-05-26 18:08:33,t3_nlnghi,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

https://preview.redd.it/s6s8qwy39i171.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7d910feb79393f4fe0de5fad54e89f5bead4c39

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

EDIT: short TLDR by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can‚Äôt fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It‚Äôs a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",nlpfk9,UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me

This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla‚Äôs self driving cars, they‚Äôll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It‚Äôs confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations.

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It‚Äôs cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That‚Äôs $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

TLDR --Premise-- ViaSat, Inc (VSAT) is a mediocre company that provides mediocre satellite service that costs way too much for what it is.... but in many places it is the ONLY option... well it was until Mr. üöÄ himself decided to eat their lunch. StarLink (part of SpaceX) is about to absolutely destroy VSAT and turn it to üí©.

TLDR --Strategy-- since you can't invest in SpaceX (private company) or Starlink (until it is spun off into a separate entity **and then DO invest there** ) I think someone that decides to buy PUTS on VSAT (give yourself A LOT of time, I'm talking June 2022 $35 or Jan 2023 $25) stands to make a lot of money ------ I'm personally not starting my position until right before the next earnings report in August. I figure the first sign of trouble will come out in an earnings report and if it isn't August then by November it'll start showing. Again **LONG** duration puts. Looking to catch that cycle when the company drops 50% on the bad news. If it goes up between now and then I'll just buy MORE puts. 

**NOT A PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL PERSON - INVEST AT YOUR OWN RISK - I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE BUT I MAY BE ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™ PERSON WHO EATS üí© FOR ALL YOU KNOW**

details

**ViaSat - How it started**

Market cap of 3.26 Billion, share price of $47.55 when I'm writing this. It got as high as the 90's before the pandemic book the shins out of the market and dropped it to $28. Since recovered a bit to... as I said $47.55

They have some satellites in space that allow people with a receiver dish to get internet from space like some kind of awesome scifi movie.... except the internet is crazy expensive for what you get. Their satellites are pretty high up and that means each one can cover a BIG area. They only seem to have a handful, maybe a dozen? But they offer pretty broad coverage and are expanding it. BUT because the satellites are high up the latency (time between your computer and your internet source or something like that) is high leading to slow speeds and overall not a great service.

They already have airlines as customers, expanding recently with Delta. Their is VERY LITTLE competition in this business and between airlines, cruise lines and rural home owners with no other option they make a nice amount of money. Totally solid business model. Internet is ever more and more important and usage on air planes and boats is only gonna go up. In fact like a lot of articles on VSAT I would probably say this is a good medium / long term buy and that is why the median price target is $67 ***EXCEPT*** I know something that the market doesn't seem to have realized yet.

>EDITED BASED ON COMMENTS  
>  
>ViaSat does have commercial business beyond airlines and cruises; I would imagine rural businesses and some VERY LARGE corporations that use it for specific use cases. There is also the DOD which they have contracts with.  
>  
>  
>  
>**I AM NOT ASSERTING THAT VIA SAT WILL GO COMPLETELY OUT OF BUSINESS.**  
>  
>  
>  
>However, while a viable company may exist beyond the coming reckoning I expect the market to react extremely negatively to ViaSat losing **ALL** of their rural residential and rural small and medium size business customers. I'm also thinking that right around the time that starts sinking in news stories about cruise lines and air lines switching over to StarLink will start popping up and again, $VSAT go **üí©.** I honestly hope VSAT does go up to the current target of the mid $60's because I'll start buying puts a small chunk at a time as it rises. Until then I'm waiting till August, right before next quarterly earnings report to start my position.

**StarLink - How it's going**

as you may the Dogefather happens to have a small üöÄ company. Its called SpaceX and they aren't publicly traded. They also are doing to the aerospace / orbit supply and transport industry what many of us wish Tesla could fully due to the fossil fuel industry. SpaceX's Falcon9 üöÄ is all sorts of amazing - mainly because it isn't thrown out after each use ($40MM in savings for each subsequent use of a booster).

StarLink is a division of SpaceX that is focused on bringing internet to the whole üåé using a crazy amount of satellites. Like... A LOT. Unlike ViaSat which has a few the StarLink constellation (thats what they call a network of satellites) has 16 HUNDRED and they are launching 60 at a time every week or so (sometimes more than once a week). Because StarLink has access to this game changing super cheap üöÄ transportation AND Musk is doing is usual weirdness by mass producing these satellites and focusing on cost and volume instead of making them SUPER DUPER reliable

Some of you may remember how TSLA was this tiny company that was prob gonna die etc. etc. and THEN üí•üí• there are Model 3's and Model Y's EVERYWHERE. Well StarLink is gonna have that moment soon. Sometime in the next few months there will suddenly be high-ish speed internet (between 50mbs and 100mbs) literally ANYWHERE on the planet for $500 down and $100 a month. Way better product and on an annualized basis way better value.",nlsu85,First real post on WSB - found a walking zombie üßü and wanted to share... I bring you a tale of.... $VSAT

Performance can only be measured through the entire cycle.    The entire Cycle exposes you from all angles. 

The human brain tends to become infected with greed at the end of a big Stage 2 run (see digital  virtuals  for current example) thus causing people to lose money after a bull market because they expect it to go on forever.

  Understanding Stage Analysis can help you overcome this  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bw41ugsodj171.png?width=490&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b63e3098a3c451ed5536be730650feb79008527

So now let's  dig in our today's post and my targets  : 

1-  Silver will enjoy huge capital flows from those digital assets  holders in a time after overcame and understand stage analysis .... who will now seek the silver whale! 

&#x200B;

2- We are in stage 2 for silver  !!! We can expect parabolic moves any time .  

 Opportunity of buying silver cheap and timely is about to end. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  ( gold did it 2020 July ) 

So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN?  

Tic Toc !

&#x200B;

3-  Silver is in a position of strength. US Dollar is in a position of weakness. 

 The final 15% decline in the US Dollar index WILL send silver parabolic!

&#x200B;

4-  The ""silver"" macro tidal wave is picking up steam &will crush all price suppression along the way...  Q2 close will set the stage how fast the insanity picks up.  HOLD ON TIGHT! Easy 56$ and 120$ targets 

This is not financial advice . I hold 1700 ozz of physical silver .",nlt5x7,Understanding Stage Analysis and ready for big explosive moves !

5736,,2021-05-26 23:30:49,t3_nlugr7,,wallstreetbets,"CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer said Wednesday he‚Äôs not sure why any investors are still betting against GameStop and AMC Entertainment, two of the so-called meme stocks popular on Reddit‚Äôs WallStreetBets forum.
.
.
The ‚ÄúMad Money‚Äù host made his comments following a session in which GameStop shares rose almost 16% Wednesday and AMC advanced 19%. The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.
.
.
‚ÄúAnyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,‚Äù Cramer said.
.
.
Despite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC ‚Äî which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming ‚Äî is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.
.
.
But Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.
.
.
Shorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.
.
.
When the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.
.
.
Both GameStop and AMC have over 20% of their float shares sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. That‚Äôs compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock.
.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like this: a group of buyers with no sensitivity to price,‚Äù Cramer said. ‚ÄúThese people don‚Äôt have unlimited firepower, but they‚Äôve got enough firepower to engineer a short-squeeze any time a bunch of professionals decide to bet against this thing.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt want to share with you something that you all heard so many times (yep, I haven't lost my fate in humanity) like avoid margin trading or invest in mutual funds. I believe I have some wisdom I wish I had from the beginning.

1. Trading is just 5% theory and 95% about emotional control, risk and money management, overcoming one‚Äôs greed, having strict stoploss and targets predefined before taking a trade.
2. Don‚Äôt follow advice from forums blindly. Build your own map of the world. Each of us learn to trade at our own pace and don‚Äôt get discouraged if you find that after a few years, you‚Äôre still struggling to master the ‚Äòmoney game‚Äô. You can keep in mind different advice from experienced players (e.g. I recommend this qooore app and it's discord community), *but it's vital for the final decision to be yours*.
3. Accept losses and do not make investment decisions based on emotion Especially greed, fear, or panic. Yep, you didn‚Äôt buy Betcoin (lol couldn't resist) at 3,000$ because you didn‚Äôt know back than what direction the price would take. No regrets. Keep yourself focused on here and now, move ahead
4. Know yourself. What is your current financial situation? Why you are investing? For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully.
5. Never forget that for investing, time is your best friend - and greed is your worst enemy. Patience is a requirement in stock trading. There are no short-cuts or ‚Äòholy grail‚Äô when it comes to stock. And you only need to have couple of strategies but those should be well tested and made perfect over the period of time.

To me, trading is a skill that requires 3Ls - ‚ÄòLife-Long Learning‚Äù.

Stay humble, be honest and willing to admit your mistakes in trading and don‚Äôt try to rationalise and explain mistakes away, and always remain teachable and never think you‚Äôve ‚Äòarrived‚Äô.",nlvay0,After 3 years of learning investment: my 5 tips for those who just started

I didn't post the content here so I thought I would share it as I know everyone is interested in AMC at the moment! I know it's a lot to read so if you prefer to watch the video, the link for that is also included below:

Why Cinema Stocks like AMC will benefit from reopening? 

Time-Frame: Cinema‚Äôs will benefit from reopening and the economic recovery that is occurring all over the world. Especially over a longer timeframe.  I think that Cinemas can be a good trade in the medium term and can help you make money. It‚Äôs all dependent on data and how quickly things go back to normal, but my timeframe on this trade right now is 1-2 years. Maybe even shorter, perhaps 6 months if we bounce back very quickly. Maybe not the most likely, but still a possible scenario that I have to consider. 

&#x200B;

Thesis: 

1)  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a very strong negative impact on the cinema sector. So, naturally as things reopen and vaccinations increase all over North America, these companies stand to benefit. If we look back from the end of January 2020 to the end of April 2021, Marcus Corporation was down approximately 33% from January 27th, 2020. Cinemark is down approximately 35% over the same time period, while National CineMedia is down almost 42% and AMC is up almost 57%. Price is an important factor to consider when buying and selling stocks and this something that is important to consider 

2) Cinemas have suffered tremendously with the Covid-19 pandemic, which makes the cinema sector intriguing as the world re-opens. If we look to Asia, especially China and Japan, where Covid-19 cases subsided and theatres reopened, things look promising.  There was a substantial increase in demand, with demand actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. In China, December 2020 ticket sales at IMAX‚Äôs big-screen theatres jumped 28 per cent from a year earlier, while in Japan, they broke daily records and a record number of people saw movies on the first weekend of January 2021. Clearly, there was a lot of pent-up demand which surfaced and benefitted movie theatres in Asia. 

3) And you know what I‚Äôve seen this film before. Last year early in February, there was a sudden spike in downloads of the Zoom app in China, and the stock at that was point already doing well, up roughly 30 percent from the start of the year. But this spike in Zoom usage soon spread all over the world, and the rest is history. It was an absolutely humungous winner last year. There are obviously sector wide risks with consumer preferences changing, and more and more people preferring to watch films at home. The increase in Netflix & streaming service subscribers over the years is a clear indication of consumer preferences going-forward, but I do like movie theatres as a trade. There is a lot of pent-up demand that I feel will benefit the sector. 

Risks: 

\-  One of the main risks that that most people who are considering trading or investing in cinema companies have, is the risk from Netflix and the other streaming services. Really the risk of the Direct-to-consumer approach and the effects that it will have on the cinema companies. And this is a valid concern because it has reduced demand for cinemas over the last decade. Even some of the biggest filmmakers in the world are turning to it, like Martin Scorsese, Noah Baumbach and Alfonso Cuaron.  Netflix has become the biggest movie studio in the world, at-least when it comes to volume in terms of production over the last several years. And now they plan to release 50-60 films per year, and with their pioneering Direct to Consumer approach, the film industry has changed. Cinemas are no longer at the forefront, and the Direct-to-Consumer strategy is quickly becoming the new incumbent. The DTC approach is taking over, with all the streaming services that have launched. They have taken market share from linear television and have steered consumers away from traditional Cinema.

Catalysts & Conclusion: 

1) However, I still think there is still a place for theatres, even with streaming, especially looking at the same timeframe that I‚Äôm focusing on for this trade. I think now more so than ever people want to be outside. These businesses will benefit from the change in near term consumer trends, with everyone wanting to leave the house. I really believe that the cinema sector is going to do well in North America. If Asia is anything to go by and I think it is, some of the companies involved in the sector have the potential to be great trades. People still want to go to the cinemas, especially when it comes to seeing some of the big budget films that are really made for the big screen. Blockbuster action films with awesome effects are really meant to be seen in a movie theatre in my opinion. The effects and the environment simply cannot be replicated at home. Especially when it comes to immersive experience films, like those with IMAX and 4DX. I really enjoy the cinema and think there is something to be said for being in a big space in a dark room watching a film 40 feet across. It is wonderful to sit in the comfort of your own home but there is just something to be said for having a community experience in a room. But that‚Äôs neither there nor here. 

  
2) Moving on, another potential catalyst is the potential for collaboration between theatre chains and streaming services. Netflix was the one to pioneer the Direct to Consumer, but interestingly they have begun releasing some Netflix Originals on the big screen in recent years. Films like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes all premiered in Cinemas prior to their appearance in Netflix‚Äôs online catalogue.  This is a really interesting move on their part, especially from an investment perspective. Because, while you can watch streaming services in the comfort of your own home, movie theatre companies are open to the idea of having the films that are produced by the streaming services shown in their theatres. Cinemark has shown Netflix movies in theatres in the past, and there is an off chance that they expand their agreement. This wouldn‚Äôt just apply to Cinemark but other theatre chains as well potentially. The big hold-up between the streaming services and theatre chains was the disagreement on the length of theatrical window. But last year, Universal Studios and Cinemark, AMC & Cineplex agreed to a shortened exclusive window, from 74 days to 31 days for major films, as defined by box-office domestic revenue. This makes it more likely that Netflix and other streaming services can find middle ground with the cinema companies. It‚Äôs not all that important a catalyst for the trade, nor is it all that likely, but it is still intriguing and something to consider.

3) A more important catalyst is the release of the next James Bond film, no time to die next year. I‚Äôm really excited about the movie because I‚Äôm a huge James Bond fan. It‚Äôs probably my favourite movie series. And you know what, I‚Äôm not alone. It‚Äôs very popular all over the world. The previous James Bond film, Spectre, grossed nearly $879 million. No Time To Die has been postponed several times due to the pandemic and is due to premiere on October 8th in the United States. I‚Äôm really excited about the movie and will be sure to see in theatres provided it‚Äôs safe to do so. And I think it will be. This movie is really important for the movie theatres because they have been starved and there have just been very few films to show. They have been supply constrained with the lack of new films. No Time To Die is a certain blockbuster and will really help benefit the sector. 

4) Something else that has me really excited is the recent CDC news in the US, with them updating guidance on April 2nd that fully vaccinated people can travel internationally safely and don‚Äôt need to quarantine when they return provided, they test negative within three to five days of their return. They have to test negative before they are allowed to board a return flight to the US. This is really exciting, and this combined with the idea of a vaccine passport as has been proposed by cruise lines and the UK government really provide a lot of momentum for the cinema companies.

5746,,2021-05-27 01:24:58,t3_nlwjwy,,wallstreetbets,"I will try to keep this short and sweet.
In my view the following points are justifiable:
-The VW emissions hack was not an effort to destroy the environment. 
-It was trolling done by VW officials bc they were tired of having the EPA‚Äôs pozzed dick in their asses regarding diesel emission regulations on diesel imports. 
-VW was tired of the EPA because:

     A.  In europe diesel autos make up over half of    
           all car engines. 
     B.  Cars like the Euro-version VW golf wagon      
           get almost 90 mpg. Compare that to the 
           Toyota Prius that gets 40mpg at best. 
     C.  The EPA doesnt want VW to import a 90    
           MPG diesel car to the US because it would    
           kill US auto sales, so the EPA makes diesel 
           regulations so strict that the only diesels 
           VW et. al. can import only manage 45 MPG. 
     D.  And if you want to make things fair, the 
           highest MPG diesel electric hybrid made by 
           VW gets over 200 MPG. 
     E.  Europeans aren‚Äôt idiots: they aren‚Äôt willingly 
          ‚Äúpoisoning themselves‚Äù with diesel fumes. 
          Diesel is just as clean as gas and burning 
          1 gallon of diesel fuel every 90 miles is 
          better for the environment than burning 1 
          gallon of gas every 30 miles. 
     F.  The ‚Äúsmelly/black fume producing‚Äù 
          reputation of diesel in america owes itself to 
          idiot US auto makers that in the 80‚Äôs tried to 
          make frankenstein diesel engines out of 
          modified gas engines and they ran like shit 
          and spewed black smoke. These atrocities    
          were unlike the clean running diesel engines 
          that were being produced in Germany at the 
          same time. 
-In summary, the EPA has been punishing European Auto makers (VW) for American auto makers‚Äô past engineering disgraces, and when VW officials got tired of being unfairly punished they decided to troll the EPA with an emissions hack. 
-They did it to slam some jimmies, not to gain      
profit or destroy the environment. 
-German authorities know this, which is why they released key players like Oliver Schmidt who was let out on parole right after he was transferred from US prison to German authorities. 
-The loss of stock value that occured from the scandal was unjustified then, and the stagnation of VW stock price since then has been unjustified in light of the fact that VW‚Äôs P/E in the last 3 months has been between 50-70 times lower than that of Tesla, and historically it has been foolish to underestimate the ability of Volkswagen to perform at the cutting edge of the industry. 
-The Emissions hack has nothing negative to say about Volkswagens fierce engineering capability and in my view it has something positive to say about the youthfulness and creativity of the company.

Besides commercial passengers, the company has also generated some revenue by carrying payloads into space in recent years. Assuming that this will grow to about $12 million by 2022, total revenues would stand at $50 million for the year.

Technically there is a maximum amount that can be handled by the Nasdaq since may 17 wich is at 1,844,674,407,370,955.1615 USD

So here we have the maximum price for a hammer super Dupa short squeeze.

One thing not really considered, is what happens with the immense amount of capital raised from naked shorting. This is money that has been ‚Äúprinted‚Äù, and is now on their books. Obviously they won‚Äôt warehouse it as cash, makes more sense to take the opposite end of the trade with their own companies - buy their own stock with this to inflate the price. A great store of value would also be real estate.

Result: astronomical increases in those asset areas, and another push of inflation that feds would be unable to address (since they are turning a blind eye). Just look at home prices & large cap eq prices since the derivatives market became a major tool (~1980)",nm5r1j,Implications to the market not discussed - high real estate & other asset prices

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG‚Äôs Graphene and UQ‚Äôs patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

The move, yesterday, saw significant acceleration in the latter part of the day as 4 Million share trade crossed the tape, for a $32 Million long bet. Source of this placement isn't clear, but comes the day after CFO, Kyle Wailes, commented on the significant insider ownership of the company, adding that board members, founders, C-suit and friends and family have collectively pushed their own to over 70% of the company. Given that, of the float, 76% is owned by institutions, and 35% of shares are shorted, yesterday's bold investment in the company might well accelerate the uptrend of the share price, as massive short covering is expected once the price point passes $8.60 and $9.30, respectively.",,

**What I'm doing**: Averaging in slowly in preparation for the 10D EMA to come in in preparation for another leg higher.

Market

* **The RPA Market is growing rapidly**: GVR estimates the global robotic process automation market to grow at 34% CAGR through 2028 while Gartner estimates it to grow at over 24% YoY CAGR - to $600B, through 2022 ([source](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-28-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-hyperautomation-enabling-software-market-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-by-2022)) and expects $PATH to grow at 33% CAGR ([source](https://www.uipath.com/resources/automation-analyst-reports/gartner-magic-quadrant-robotic-process-automation))
* **$PATH dominates the most important regions for RPA**: North America (accounts for 37% of global RPA spend ([source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/robotic-process-automation-rpa-market)) and as of January¬†31, 2021, $PATH had 7,968¬†customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 63% of the Fortune Global 500 ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_9))

Company & Financials

* **$PATH can expect high levels of current customer retention**: UiPath has an NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 71 over the past 12 mo period, lightyears beyond the industry average of 39 ([Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_4), [Source](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/))

Sup, WSB folks!

It‚Äôs Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I‚Äôm the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we‚Äôll take a look at the superior stonk‚Äòs current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‚Äòs fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF‚Äôs GF‚Äôs ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to üêª in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day!

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices.

6304,,2021-05-26 17:48:02,t3_nlmzdx,,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

6305,,2021-05-26 18:08:33,t3_nlnghi,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

https://preview.redd.it/s6s8qwy39i171.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7d910feb79393f4fe0de5fad54e89f5bead4c39

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run.

Cathy Wood took a position and exited it fairly quickly, before the most recent good data.  If they can retrace even half of the move down from earlier this year it would be a big gain.  I think the CEO is universally disliked and should have looked to be an acquisition target a long time ago by one of the big players, but instead was making deals and trying to just do collaborations.  It seems like traders hate this stock and short sellers move the price on a daily basis. Anyone have an opinion on it?",nlpp70,Sarepta SRPT

Black berry‚Äôs forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let‚Äôs start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It‚Äôs essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars‚Äô software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla‚Äôs self driving cars, they‚Äôll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It‚Äôs confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It‚Äôs cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That‚Äôs $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

TLDR --Premise-- ViaSat, Inc (VSAT) is a mediocre company that provides mediocre satellite service that costs way too much for what it is.... but in many places it is the ONLY option... well it was until Mr. üöÄ himself decided to eat their lunch. StarLink (part of SpaceX) is about to absolutely destroy VSAT and turn it to üí©.

TLDR --Strategy-- since you can't invest in SpaceX (private company) or Starlink (until it is spun off into a separate entity **and then DO invest there** ) I think someone that decides to buy PUTS on VSAT (give yourself A LOT of time, I'm talking June 2022 $35 or Jan 2023 $25) stands to make a lot of money ------ I'm personally not starting my position until right before the next earnings report in August. I figure the first sign of trouble will come out in an earnings report and if it isn't August then by November it'll start showing. Again **LONG** duration puts. Looking to catch that cycle when the company drops 50% on the bad news. If it goes up between now and then I'll just buy MORE puts. 

**NOT A PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL PERSON - INVEST AT YOUR OWN RISK - I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE BUT I MAY BE ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™ PERSON WHO EATS üí© FOR ALL YOU KNOW**

details

**ViaSat - How it started**

Market cap of 3.26 Billion, share price of $47.55 when I'm writing this. It got as high as the 90's before the pandemic book the shins out of the market and dropped it to $28. Since recovered a bit to... as I said $47.55

They have some satellites in space that allow people with a receiver dish to get internet from space like some kind of awesome scifi movie.... except the internet is crazy expensive for what you get. Their satellites are pretty high up and that means each one can cover a BIG area. They only seem to have a handful, maybe a dozen? But they offer pretty broad coverage and are expanding it. BUT because the satellites are high up the latency (time between your computer and your internet source or something like that) is high leading to slow speeds and overall not a great service.

They already have airlines as customers, expanding recently with Delta. Their is VERY LITTLE competition in this business and between airlines, cruise lines and rural home owners with no other option they make a nice amount of money. Totally solid business model. Internet is ever more and more important and usage on air planes and boats is only gonna go up. In fact like a lot of articles on VSAT I would probably say this is a good medium / long term buy and that is why the median price target is $67 ***EXCEPT*** I know something that the market doesn't seem to have realized yet.

>EDITED BASED ON COMMENTS  
>  
>ViaSat does have commercial business beyond airlines and cruises; I would imagine rural businesses and some VERY LARGE corporations that use it for specific use cases. There is also the DOD which they have contracts with.  
>  
>  
>  
>**I AM NOT ASSERTING THAT VIA SAT WILL GO COMPLETELY OUT OF BUSINESS.**  
>  
>  
>  
>However, while a viable company may exist beyond the coming reckoning I expect the market to react extremely negatively to ViaSat losing **ALL** of their rural residential and rural small and medium size business customers. I'm also thinking that right around the time that starts sinking in news stories about cruise lines and air lines switching over to StarLink will start popping up and again, $VSAT go **üí©.** I honestly hope VSAT does go up to the current target of the mid $60's because I'll start buying puts a small chunk at a time as it rises. Until then I'm waiting till August, right before next quarterly earnings report to start my position.

**StarLink - How it's going**

as you may the Dogefather happens to have a small üöÄ company. Its called SpaceX and they aren't publicly traded. They also are doing to the aerospace / orbit supply and transport industry what many of us wish Tesla could fully due to the fossil fuel industry. SpaceX's Falcon9 üöÄ is all sorts of amazing - mainly because it isn't thrown out after each use ($40MM in savings for each subsequent use of a booster).

StarLink is a division of SpaceX that is focused on bringing internet to the whole üåé using a crazy amount of satellites. Like... A LOT. Unlike ViaSat which has a few the StarLink constellation (thats what they call a network of satellites) has 16 HUNDRED and they are launching 60 at a time every week or so (sometimes more than once a week). Because StarLink has access to this game changing super cheap üöÄ transportation AND Musk is doing is usual weirdness by mass producing these satellites and focusing on cost and volume instead of making them SUPER DUPER reliable

Some of you may remember how TSLA was this tiny company that was prob gonna die etc. etc. and THEN üí•üí• there are Model 3's and Model Y's EVERYWHERE. Well StarLink is gonna have that moment soon. Sometime in the next few months there will suddenly be high-ish speed internet (between 50mbs and 100mbs) literally ANYWHERE on the planet for $500 down and $100 a month.

Performance can only be measured through the entire cycle.    The entire Cycle exposes you from all angles. 

The human brain tends to become infected with greed at the end of a big Stage 2 run (see digital  virtuals  for current example) thus causing people to lose money after a bull market because they expect it to go on forever.

  Understanding Stage Analysis can help you overcome this  

&#x200B;

So now let's  dig in our today's post and my targets  : 

1-  Silver will enjoy huge capital flows from those digital assets  holders in a time after overcame and understand stage analysis .... who will now seek the silver whale! 

&#x200B;

2- We are in stage 2 for silver  !!! We can expect parabolic moves any time .  

 Opportunity of buying silver cheap and timely is about to end. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  ( gold did it 2020 July ) 

So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN?  

Tic Toc !

&#x200B;

3-  Silver is in a position of strength. US Dollar is in a position of weakness. 

 The final 15% decline in the US Dollar index WILL send silver parabolic!

&#x200B;

4-  The ""silver"" macro tidal wave is picking up steam &will crush all price suppression along the way...  Q2 close will set the stage how fast the insanity picks up.  HOLD ON TIGHT! Easy 56$ and 120$ targets 

This is not financial advice . I hold 1700 ozz of physical silver .",nlt5x7,Understanding Stage Analysis and ready for big explosive moves !

6350,,2021-05-26 23:30:49,t3_nlugr7,,wallstreetbets,"CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer said Wednesday he‚Äôs not sure why any investors are still betting against GameStop and AMC Entertainment, two of the so-called meme stocks popular on Reddit‚Äôs WallStreetBets forum.
.
.
The ‚ÄúMad Money‚Äù host made his comments following a session in which GameStop shares rose almost 16% Wednesday and AMC advanced 19%. The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.
.
.
‚ÄúAnyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,‚Äù Cramer said.
.
.
Despite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC ‚Äî which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming ‚Äî is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.
.
.
But Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.
.
.
Shorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.
.
.
When the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.
.
.
Both GameStop and AMC have over 20% of their float shares sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. That‚Äôs compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock.
.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like this: a group of buyers with no sensitivity to price,‚Äù Cramer said. ‚ÄúThese people don‚Äôt have unlimited firepower, but they‚Äôve got enough firepower to engineer a short-squeeze any time a bunch of professionals decide to bet against this thing.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt want to share with you something that you all heard so many times (yep, I haven't lost my fate in humanity) like avoid margin trading or invest in mutual funds. I believe I have some wisdom I wish I had from the beginning.

1. Trading is just 5% theory and 95% about emotional control, risk and money management, overcoming one‚Äôs greed, having strict stoploss and targets predefined before taking a trade.
2. Don‚Äôt follow advice from forums blindly. Build your own map of the world. Each of us learn to trade at our own pace and don‚Äôt get discouraged if you find that after a few years, you‚Äôre still struggling to master the ‚Äòmoney game‚Äô. You can keep in mind different advice from experienced players (e.g. I recommend this qooore app and it's discord community), *but it's vital for the final decision to be yours*.
3. Accept losses and do not make investment decisions based on emotion Especially greed, fear, or panic. Yep, you didn‚Äôt buy Betcoin (lol couldn't resist) at 3,000$ because you didn‚Äôt know back than what direction the price would take. No regrets. Keep yourself focused on here and now, move ahead
4. Know yourself. What is your current financial situation? Why you are investing? For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully.
5. Never forget that for investing, time is your best friend - and greed is your worst enemy. Patience is a requirement in stock trading. There are no short-cuts or ‚Äòholy grail‚Äô when it comes to stock. And you only need to have couple of strategies but those should be well tested and made perfect over the period of time.

To me, trading is a skill that requires 3Ls - ‚ÄòLife-Long Learning‚Äù.

Stay humble, be honest and willing to admit your mistakes in trading and don‚Äôt try to rationalise and explain mistakes away, and always remain teachable and never think you‚Äôve ‚Äòarrived‚Äô.",nlvay0,After 3 years of learning investment: my 5 tips for those who just started

6359,,2021-05-27 01:00:08,t3_nlw3ty,,wallstreetbets,"Hi Everyone! I did some research on cinema stocks a while back and made a video on it. I didn't post the content here so I thought I would share it as I know everyone is interested in AMC at the moment! I know it's a lot to read so if you prefer to watch the video, the link for that is also included below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s)

Why Cinema Stocks like AMC will benefit from reopening? 

Time-Frame: Cinema‚Äôs will benefit from reopening and the economic recovery that is occurring all over the world. Especially over a longer timeframe.  I think that Cinemas can be a good trade in the medium term and can help you make money. It‚Äôs all dependent on data and how quickly things go back to normal, but my timeframe on this trade right now is 1-2 years. Maybe even shorter, perhaps 6 months if we bounce back very quickly. Maybe not the most likely, but still a possible scenario that I have to consider. 

&#x200B;

Thesis: 

1)  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a very strong negative impact on the cinema sector. So, naturally as things reopen and vaccinations increase all over North America, these companies stand to benefit. If we look back from the end of January 2020 to the end of April 2021, Marcus Corporation was down approximately 33% from January 27th, 2020. Cinemark is down approximately 35% over the same time period, while National CineMedia is down almost 42% and AMC is up almost 57%. Price is an important factor to consider when buying and selling stocks and this something that is important to consider 

2) Cinemas have suffered tremendously with the Covid-19 pandemic, which makes the cinema sector intriguing as the world re-opens. If we look to Asia, especially China and Japan, where Covid-19 cases subsided and theatres reopened, things look promising.  There was a substantial increase in demand, with demand actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. In China, December 2020 ticket sales at IMAX‚Äôs big-screen theatres jumped 28 per cent from a year earlier, while in Japan, they broke daily records and a record number of people saw movies on the first weekend of January 2021. Clearly, there was a lot of pent-up demand which surfaced and benefitted movie theatres in Asia. 

3) And you know what I‚Äôve seen this film before. Last year early in February, there was a sudden spike in downloads of the Zoom app in China, and the stock at that was point already doing well, up roughly 30 percent from the start of the year. But this spike in Zoom usage soon spread all over the world, and the rest is history. It was an absolutely humungous winner last year. There are obviously sector wide risks with consumer preferences changing, and more and more people preferring to watch films at home. The increase in Netflix & streaming service subscribers over the years is a clear indication of consumer preferences going-forward, but I do like movie theatres as a trade. There is a lot of pent-up demand that I feel will benefit the sector. 

Risks: 

\-  One of the main risks that that most people who are considering trading or investing in cinema companies have, is the risk from Netflix and the other streaming services. Really the risk of the Direct-to-consumer approach and the effects that it will have on the cinema companies. And this is a valid concern because it has reduced demand for cinemas over the last decade. Even some of the biggest filmmakers in the world are turning to it, like Martin Scorsese, Noah Baumbach and Alfonso Cuaron.  Netflix has become the biggest movie studio in the world, at-least when it comes to volume in terms of production over the last several years. And now they plan to release 50-60 films per year, and with their pioneering Direct to Consumer approach, the film industry has changed. Cinemas are no longer at the forefront, and the Direct-to-Consumer strategy is quickly becoming the new incumbent. The DTC approach is taking over, with all the streaming services that have launched. They have taken market share from linear television and have steered consumers away from traditional Cinema.

Catalysts & Conclusion: 

1) However, I still think there is still a place for theatres, even with streaming, especially looking at the same timeframe that I‚Äôm focusing on for this trade. I think now more so than ever people want to be outside. These businesses will benefit from the change in near term consumer trends, with everyone wanting to leave the house. I really believe that the cinema sector is going to do well in North America. If Asia is anything to go by and I think it is, some of the companies involved in the sector have the potential to be great trades. People still want to go to the cinemas, especially when it comes to seeing some of the big budget films that are really made for the big screen. Blockbuster action films with awesome effects are really meant to be seen in a movie theatre in my opinion. The effects and the environment simply cannot be replicated at home. Especially when it comes to immersive experience films, like those with IMAX and 4DX. I really enjoy the cinema and think there is something to be said for being in a big space in a dark room watching a film 40 feet across. It is wonderful to sit in the comfort of your own home but there is just something to be said for having a community experience in a room. But that‚Äôs neither there nor here. 

  
2) Moving on, another potential catalyst is the potential for collaboration between theatre chains and streaming services. Netflix was the one to pioneer the Direct to Consumer, but interestingly they have begun releasing some Netflix Originals on the big screen in recent years. Films like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes all premiered in Cinemas prior to their appearance in Netflix‚Äôs online catalogue.  This is a really interesting move on their part, especially from an investment perspective. Because, while you can watch streaming services in the comfort of your own home, movie theatre companies are open to the idea of having the films that are produced by the streaming services shown in their theatres. Cinemark has shown Netflix movies in theatres in the past, and there is an off chance that they expand their agreement. This wouldn‚Äôt just apply to Cinemark but other theatre chains as well potentially. The big hold-up between the streaming services and theatre chains was the disagreement on the length of theatrical window. But last year, Universal Studios and Cinemark, AMC & Cineplex agreed to a shortened exclusive window, from 74 days to 31 days for major films, as defined by box-office domestic revenue. This makes it more likely that Netflix and other streaming services can find middle ground with the cinema companies. It‚Äôs not all that important a catalyst for the trade, nor is it all that likely, but it is still intriguing and something to consider.

3) A more important catalyst is the release of the next James Bond film, no time to die next year. I‚Äôm really excited about the movie because I‚Äôm a huge James Bond fan. It‚Äôs probably my favourite movie series. And you know what, I‚Äôm not alone. It‚Äôs very popular all over the world. The previous James Bond film, Spectre, grossed nearly $879 million. No Time To Die has been postponed several times due to the pandemic and is due to premiere on October 8th in the United States. I‚Äôm really excited about the movie and will be sure to see in theatres provided it‚Äôs safe to do so. And I think it will be. This movie is really important for the movie theatres because they have been starved and there have just been very few films to show. They have been supply constrained with the lack of new films. No Time To Die is a certain blockbuster and will really help benefit the sector. 

4) Something else that has me really excited is the recent CDC news in the US, with them updating guidance on April 2nd that fully vaccinated people can travel internationally safely and don‚Äôt need to quarantine when they return provided, they test negative within three to five days of their return. They have to test negative before they are allowed to board a return flight to the US. This is really exciting, and this combined with the idea of a vaccine passport as has been proposed by cruise lines and the UK government really provide a lot of momentum for the cinema companies.

6360,,2021-05-27 01:24:58,t3_nlwjwy,,wallstreetbets,"I will try to keep this short and sweet.
In my view the following points are justifiable:
-The VW emissions hack was not an effort to destroy the environment. 
-It was trolling done by VW officials bc they were tired of having the EPA‚Äôs pozzed dick in their asses regarding diesel emission regulations on diesel imports. 
-VW was tired of the EPA because:

     A.  In europe diesel autos make up over half of    
           all car engines. 
     B.  Cars like the Euro-version VW golf wagon      
           get almost 90 mpg. Compare that to the 
           Toyota Prius that gets 40mpg at best. 
     C.  The EPA doesnt want VW to import a 90    
           MPG diesel car to the US because it would    
           kill US auto sales, so the EPA makes diesel 
           regulations so strict that the only diesels 
           VW et. al. can import only manage 45 MPG. 
     D.  And if you want to make things fair, the 
           highest MPG diesel electric hybrid made by 
           VW gets over 200 MPG. 
     E.  Europeans aren‚Äôt idiots: they aren‚Äôt willingly 
          ‚Äúpoisoning themselves‚Äù with diesel fumes. 
          Diesel is just as clean as gas and burning 
          1 gallon of diesel fuel every 90 miles is 
          better for the environment than burning 1 
          gallon of gas every 30 miles. 
     F.  The ‚Äúsmelly/black fume producing‚Äù 
          reputation of diesel in america owes itself to 
          idiot US auto makers that in the 80‚Äôs tried to 
          make frankenstein diesel engines out of 
          modified gas engines and they ran like shit 
          and spewed black smoke. These atrocities    
          were unlike the clean running diesel engines 
          that were being produced in Germany at the 
          same time. 
-In summary, the EPA has been punishing European Auto makers (VW) for American auto makers‚Äô past engineering disgraces, and when VW officials got tired of being unfairly punished they decided to troll the EPA with an emissions hack. 
-They did it to slam some jimmies, not to gain      
profit or destroy the environment. 
-German authorities know this, which is why they released key players like Oliver Schmidt who was let out on parole right after he was transferred from US prison to German authorities. 
-The loss of stock value that occured from the scandal was unjustified then, and the stagnation of VW stock price since then has been unjustified in light of the fact that VW‚Äôs P/E in the last 3 months has been between 50-70 times lower than that of Tesla, and historically it has been foolish to underestimate the ability of Volkswagen to perform at the cutting edge of the industry. 
-The Emissions hack has nothing negative to say about Volkswagens fierce engineering capability and in my view it has something positive to say about the youthfulness and creativity of the company.

Seems this is the MGM entertainment division...its selling in the basement of my TD Ameritrade account on the  ""Grey Market"" (that don't sound to reassuring)  @ $80 a share.

I've read that in older deals if you buy the stock in the old company when the deal is made you can get a piece of the parent company...

Is this a 9D Chess move to get some part of  the $3K plus Amazon stock in the near future for $80?

As I read several times there could be the posibibility of maybe hitting a shareprice of several million dollars for either $GME, $AMC or whatever retards are trading with.

Technically there is a maximum amount that can be handled by the Nasdaq since may 17 wich is at 1,844,674,407,370,955.1615 USD

So here we have the maximum price for a hammer super Dupa short squeeze.

One thing not really considered, is what happens with the immense amount of capital raised from naked shorting. This is money that has been ‚Äúprinted‚Äù, and is now on their books. Obviously they won‚Äôt warehouse it as cash, makes more sense to take the opposite end of the trade with their own companies - buy their own stock with this to inflate the price. A great store of value would also be real estate.

Result: astronomical increases in those asset areas, and another push of inflation that feds would be unable to address (since they are turning a blind eye). Just look at home prices & large cap eq prices since the derivatives market became a major tool (~1980)",nm5r1j,Implications to the market not discussed - high real estate & other asset prices

But once you're going, I would say it's about 2/3 the price of traditional construction if you know what you're doing and can meet demand properly. I also find that most clients want customization so very few have wanted set models unless we're dealing with for example a trailer park or resort developer. With customization comes extra costs and lots of upgrading on the client side. You're limited to specific ceiling heights and modules because the labour it takes to say cut out an an entire side is very expensive and time consuming. We're still learning as we go along. Thankfully we have a primary business that's related so we have resources to fall back on. It's probably way cheaper in place with less regulations like the US. But we don't want to build units that can potentially kill someone in the long-term or grow mold cuz it's not ventilated properly etc. I see so many DIYers and it's great until your window starts sagging because you haven't correctly engineered it for the weight and property of the steel. We definitely have moved onto steel framed modular houses. You can build whatever you want and have cathedral ceilings. Still have limitations due to shipping logistics and costs (width of modules.

Sup, WSB folks!

It‚Äôs Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I‚Äôm the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we‚Äôll take a look at the superior stonk‚Äòs current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‚Äòs fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF‚Äôs GF‚Äôs ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to üêª in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day!

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices.

6692,,2021-05-26 17:48:02,t3_nlmzdx,,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

6693,,2021-05-26 18:08:33,t3_nlnghi,,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

https://preview.redd.it/s6s8qwy39i171.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7d910feb79393f4fe0de5fad54e89f5bead4c39

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can‚Äôt fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish.

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \(high short float\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",nlpfk9,UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me

They had a bad report which sent the stock down 50% earlier this year, but recently followed it up with some good data and reports from people in their trials are that their gene therapy produces results.  They will never cure anything, but for kids with muscular distrophy just keeping them from getting worse is as good as a cure.  Cathy Wood took a position and exited it fairly quickly, before the most recent good data.  If they can retrace even half of the move down from earlier this year it would be a big gain.  I think the CEO is universally disliked and should have looked to be an acquisition target a long time ago by one of the big players, but instead was making deals and trying to just do collaborations.

Black berry‚Äôs forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let‚Äôs start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It‚Äôs essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars‚Äô software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla‚Äôs self driving cars, they‚Äôll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It‚Äôs confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It‚Äôs cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That‚Äôs $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

TLDR --Premise-- ViaSat, Inc (VSAT) is a mediocre company that provides mediocre satellite service that costs way too much for what it is.... but in many places it is the ONLY option... well it was until Mr. üöÄ himself decided to eat their lunch. StarLink (part of SpaceX) is about to absolutely destroy VSAT and turn it to üí©.

TLDR --Strategy-- since you can't invest in SpaceX (private company) or Starlink (until it is spun off into a separate entity **and then DO invest there** ) I think someone that decides to buy PUTS on VSAT (give yourself A LOT of time, I'm talking June 2022 $35 or Jan 2023 $25) stands to make a lot of money ------ I'm personally not starting my position until right before the next earnings report in August. I figure the first sign of trouble will come out in an earnings report and if it isn't August then by November it'll start showing. Again **LONG** duration puts. Looking to catch that cycle when the company drops 50% on the bad news. If it goes up between now and then I'll just buy MORE puts. 

**NOT A PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL PERSON - INVEST AT YOUR OWN RISK - I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE BUT I MAY BE ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™ PERSON WHO EATS üí© FOR ALL YOU KNOW**

details

**ViaSat - How it started**

Market cap of 3.26 Billion, share price of $47.55 when I'm writing this. It got as high as the 90's before the pandemic book the shins out of the market and dropped it to $28. Since recovered a bit to... as I said $47.55

They have some satellites in space that allow people with a receiver dish to get internet from space like some kind of awesome scifi movie.... except the internet is crazy expensive for what you get. Their satellites are pretty high up and that means each one can cover a BIG area. They only seem to have a handful, maybe a dozen? But they offer pretty broad coverage and are expanding it. BUT because the satellites are high up the latency (time between your computer and your internet source or something like that) is high leading to slow speeds and overall not a great service.

They already have airlines as customers, expanding recently with Delta. Their is VERY LITTLE competition in this business and between airlines, cruise lines and rural home owners with no other option they make a nice amount of money. Totally solid business model. Internet is ever more and more important and usage on air planes and boats is only gonna go up. In fact like a lot of articles on VSAT I would probably say this is a good medium / long term buy and that is why the median price target is $67 ***EXCEPT*** I know something that the market doesn't seem to have realized yet.

>EDITED BASED ON COMMENTS  
>  
>ViaSat does have commercial business beyond airlines and cruises; I would imagine rural businesses and some VERY LARGE corporations that use it for specific use cases. There is also the DOD which they have contracts with.  
>  
>  
>  
>**I AM NOT ASSERTING THAT VIA SAT WILL GO COMPLETELY OUT OF BUSINESS.**  
>  
>  
>  
>However, while a viable company may exist beyond the coming reckoning I expect the market to react extremely negatively to ViaSat losing **ALL** of their rural residential and rural small and medium size business customers. I'm also thinking that right around the time that starts sinking in news stories about cruise lines and air lines switching over to StarLink will start popping up and again, $VSAT go **üí©.** I honestly hope VSAT does go up to the current target of the mid $60's because I'll start buying puts a small chunk at a time as it rises. Until then I'm waiting till August, right before next quarterly earnings report to start my position.

**StarLink - How it's going**

as you may the Dogefather happens to have a small üöÄ company. Its called SpaceX and they aren't publicly traded. They also are doing to the aerospace / orbit supply and transport industry what many of us wish Tesla could fully due to the fossil fuel industry. SpaceX's Falcon9 üöÄ is all sorts of amazing - mainly because it isn't thrown out after each use ($40MM in savings for each subsequent use of a booster).

StarLink is a division of SpaceX that is focused on bringing internet to the whole üåé using a crazy amount of satellites. Like... A LOT. Unlike ViaSat which has a few the StarLink constellation (thats what they call a network of satellites) has 16 HUNDRED and they are launching 60 at a time every week or so (sometimes more than once a week). Because StarLink has access to this game changing super cheap üöÄ transportation AND Musk is doing is usual weirdness by mass producing these satellites and focusing on cost and volume instead of making them SUPER DUPER reliable

Some of you may remember how TSLA was this tiny company that was prob gonna die etc. etc. and THEN üí•üí• there are Model 3's and Model Y's EVERYWHERE. Well StarLink is gonna have that moment soon. Sometime in the next few months there will suddenly be high-ish speed internet (between 50mbs and 100mbs) literally ANYWHERE on the planet for $500 down and $100 a month.

Performance can only be measured through the entire cycle.    The entire Cycle exposes you from all angles. 

The human brain tends to become infected with greed at the end of a big Stage 2 run (see digital  virtuals  for current example) thus causing people to lose money after a bull market because they expect it to go on forever.

  Understanding Stage Analysis can help you overcome this  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bw41ugsodj171.png?width=490&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b63e3098a3c451ed5536be730650feb79008527

So now let's  dig in our today's post and my targets  : 

1-  Silver will enjoy huge capital flows from those digital assets  holders in a time after overcame and understand stage analysis .... who will now seek the silver whale! 

&#x200B;

2- We are in stage 2 for silver  !!! We can expect parabolic moves any time .  

 Opportunity of buying silver cheap and timely is about to end. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  ( gold did it 2020 July ) 

So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN?  

Tic Toc !

&#x200B;

3-  Silver is in a position of strength. US Dollar is in a position of weakness. 

 The final 15% decline in the US Dollar index WILL send silver parabolic!

&#x200B;

4-  The ""silver"" macro tidal wave is picking up steam &will crush all price suppression along the way...  Q2 close will set the stage how fast the insanity picks up.  HOLD ON TIGHT! Easy 56$ and 120$ targets 

This is not financial advice . I hold 1700 ozz of physical silver .",nlt5x7,Understanding Stage Analysis and ready for big explosive moves !

6738,,2021-05-26 23:30:49,t3_nlugr7,,wallstreetbets,"CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer said Wednesday he‚Äôs not sure why any investors are still betting against GameStop and AMC Entertainment, two of the so-called meme stocks popular on Reddit‚Äôs WallStreetBets forum.
.
.
The ‚ÄúMad Money‚Äù host made his comments following a session in which GameStop shares rose almost 16% Wednesday and AMC advanced 19%. The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.
.
.
‚ÄúAnyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,‚Äù Cramer said.
.
.
Despite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC ‚Äî which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming ‚Äî is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.
.
.
But Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.
.
.
Shorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.
.
.
When the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.
.
.

I don‚Äôt want to share with you something that you all heard so many times (yep, I haven't lost my fate in humanity) like avoid margin trading or invest in mutual funds. I believe I have some wisdom I wish I had from the beginning.

1. Trading is just 5% theory and 95% about emotional control, risk and money management, overcoming one‚Äôs greed, having strict stoploss and targets predefined before taking a trade.
2. Don‚Äôt follow advice from forums blindly. Build your own map of the world. Each of us learn to trade at our own pace and don‚Äôt get discouraged if you find that after a few years, you‚Äôre still struggling to master the ‚Äòmoney game‚Äô. You can keep in mind different advice from experienced players (e.g. I recommend this qooore app and it's discord community), *but it's vital for the final decision to be yours*.
3. Accept losses and do not make investment decisions based on emotion Especially greed, fear, or panic. Yep, you didn‚Äôt buy Betcoin (lol couldn't resist) at 3,000$ because you didn‚Äôt know back than what direction the price would take. No regrets. Keep yourself focused on here and now, move ahead
4. Know yourself. What is your current financial situation? Why you are investing? For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully.
5. Never forget that for investing, time is your best friend - and greed is your worst enemy. Patience is a requirement in stock trading. There are no short-cuts or ‚Äòholy grail‚Äô when it comes to stock. And you only need to have couple of strategies but those should be well tested and made perfect over the period of time.

To me, trading is a skill that requires 3Ls - ‚ÄòLife-Long Learning‚Äù.

Stay humble, be honest and willing to admit your mistakes in trading and don‚Äôt try to rationalise and explain mistakes away, and always remain teachable and never think you‚Äôve ‚Äòarrived‚Äô.",nlvay0,After 3 years of learning investment: my 5 tips for those who just started

6747,,2021-05-27 01:00:08,t3_nlw3ty,,wallstreetbets,"Hi Everyone! I did some research on cinema stocks a while back and made a video on it. I didn't post the content here so I thought I would share it as I know everyone is interested in AMC at the moment! I know it's a lot to read so if you prefer to watch the video, the link for that is also included below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s)

Why Cinema Stocks like AMC will benefit from reopening? 

Time-Frame: Cinema‚Äôs will benefit from reopening and the economic recovery that is occurring all over the world. Especially over a longer timeframe.  I think that Cinemas can be a good trade in the medium term and can help you make money. It‚Äôs all dependent on data and how quickly things go back to normal, but my timeframe on this trade right now is 1-2 years. Maybe even shorter, perhaps 6 months if we bounce back very quickly. Maybe not the most likely, but still a possible scenario that I have to consider. 

&#x200B;

Thesis: 

1)  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a very strong negative impact on the cinema sector. So, naturally as things reopen and vaccinations increase all over North America, these companies stand to benefit. If we look back from the end of January 2020 to the end of April 2021, Marcus Corporation was down approximately 33% from January 27th, 2020. Cinemark is down approximately 35% over the same time period, while National CineMedia is down almost 42% and AMC is up almost 57%. Price is an important factor to consider when buying and selling stocks and this something that is important to consider 

2) Cinemas have suffered tremendously with the Covid-19 pandemic, which makes the cinema sector intriguing as the world re-opens. If we look to Asia, especially China and Japan, where Covid-19 cases subsided and theatres reopened, things look promising.  There was a substantial increase in demand, with demand actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. In China, December 2020 ticket sales at IMAX‚Äôs big-screen theatres jumped 28 per cent from a year earlier, while in Japan, they broke daily records and a record number of people saw movies on the first weekend of January 2021. Clearly, there was a lot of pent-up demand which surfaced and benefitted movie theatres in Asia. 

3) And you know what I‚Äôve seen this film before. Last year early in February, there was a sudden spike in downloads of the Zoom app in China, and the stock at that was point already doing well, up roughly 30 percent from the start of the year. But this spike in Zoom usage soon spread all over the world, and the rest is history. It was an absolutely humungous winner last year. There are obviously sector wide risks with consumer preferences changing, and more and more people preferring to watch films at home. The increase in Netflix & streaming service subscribers over the years is a clear indication of consumer preferences going-forward, but I do like movie theatres as a trade. There is a lot of pent-up demand that I feel will benefit the sector. 

Risks: 

\-  One of the main risks that that most people who are considering trading or investing in cinema companies have, is the risk from Netflix and the other streaming services. Really the risk of the Direct-to-consumer approach and the effects that it will have on the cinema companies. And this is a valid concern because it has reduced demand for cinemas over the last decade. Even some of the biggest filmmakers in the world are turning to it, like Martin Scorsese, Noah Baumbach and Alfonso Cuaron.  Netflix has become the biggest movie studio in the world, at-least when it comes to volume in terms of production over the last several years. And now they plan to release 50-60 films per year, and with their pioneering Direct to Consumer approach, the film industry has changed. Cinemas are no longer at the forefront, and the Direct-to-Consumer strategy is quickly becoming the new incumbent. The DTC approach is taking over, with all the streaming services that have launched. They have taken market share from linear television and have steered consumers away from traditional Cinema.

Catalysts & Conclusion: 

1) However, I still think there is still a place for theatres, even with streaming, especially looking at the same timeframe that I‚Äôm focusing on for this trade. I think now more so than ever people want to be outside. These businesses will benefit from the change in near term consumer trends, with everyone wanting to leave the house. I really believe that the cinema sector is going to do well in North America. If Asia is anything to go by and I think it is, some of the companies involved in the sector have the potential to be great trades. People still want to go to the cinemas, especially when it comes to seeing some of the big budget films that are really made for the big screen. Blockbuster action films with awesome effects are really meant to be seen in a movie theatre in my opinion. The effects and the environment simply cannot be replicated at home. Especially when it comes to immersive experience films, like those with IMAX and 4DX. I really enjoy the cinema and think there is something to be said for being in a big space in a dark room watching a film 40 feet across. It is wonderful to sit in the comfort of your own home but there is just something to be said for having a community experience in a room. But that‚Äôs neither there nor here. 

  
2) Moving on, another potential catalyst is the potential for collaboration between theatre chains and streaming services. Netflix was the one to pioneer the Direct to Consumer, but interestingly they have begun releasing some Netflix Originals on the big screen in recent years. Films like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes all premiered in Cinemas prior to their appearance in Netflix‚Äôs online catalogue.  This is a really interesting move on their part, especially from an investment perspective. Because, while you can watch streaming services in the comfort of your own home, movie theatre companies are open to the idea of having the films that are produced by the streaming services shown in their theatres. Cinemark has shown Netflix movies in theatres in the past, and there is an off chance that they expand their agreement. This wouldn‚Äôt just apply to Cinemark but other theatre chains as well potentially. The big hold-up between the streaming services and theatre chains was the disagreement on the length of theatrical window. But last year, Universal Studios and Cinemark, AMC & Cineplex agreed to a shortened exclusive window, from 74 days to 31 days for major films, as defined by box-office domestic revenue. This makes it more likely that Netflix and other streaming services can find middle ground with the cinema companies. It‚Äôs not all that important a catalyst for the trade, nor is it all that likely, but it is still intriguing and something to consider.

3) A more important catalyst is the release of the next James Bond film, no time to die next year. I‚Äôm really excited about the movie because I‚Äôm a huge James Bond fan. It‚Äôs probably my favourite movie series. And you know what, I‚Äôm not alone. It‚Äôs very popular all over the world. The previous James Bond film, Spectre, grossed nearly $879 million. No Time To Die has been postponed several times due to the pandemic and is due to premiere on October 8th in the United States. I‚Äôm really excited about the movie and will be sure to see in theatres provided it‚Äôs safe to do so. And I think it will be. This movie is really important for the movie theatres because they have been starved and there have just been very few films to show. They have been supply constrained with the lack of new films. No Time To Die is a certain blockbuster and will really help benefit the sector. 

4) Something else that has me really excited is the recent CDC news in the US, with them updating guidance on April 2nd that fully vaccinated people can travel internationally safely and don‚Äôt need to quarantine when they return provided, they test negative within three to five days of their return. They have to test negative before they are allowed to board a return flight to the US. This is really exciting, and this combined with the idea of a vaccine passport as has been proposed by cruise lines and the UK government really provide a lot of momentum for the cinema companies.

6748,,2021-05-27 01:24:58,t3_nlwjwy,,wallstreetbets,"I will try to keep this short and sweet.
In my view the following points are justifiable:
-The VW emissions hack was not an effort to destroy the environment. 
-It was trolling done by VW officials bc they were tired of having the EPA‚Äôs pozzed dick in their asses regarding diesel emission regulations on diesel imports. 
-VW was tired of the EPA because:

     A.  In europe diesel autos make up over half of    
           all car engines. 
     B.  Cars like the Euro-version VW golf wagon      
           get almost 90 mpg. Compare that to the 
           Toyota Prius that gets 40mpg at best. 
     C.  The EPA doesnt want VW to import a 90    
           MPG diesel car to the US because it would    
           kill US auto sales, so the EPA makes diesel 
           regulations so strict that the only diesels 
           VW et. al. can import only manage 45 MPG. 
     D.  And if you want to make things fair, the 
           highest MPG diesel electric hybrid made by 
           VW gets over 200 MPG. 
     E.  Europeans aren‚Äôt idiots: they aren‚Äôt willingly 
          ‚Äúpoisoning themselves‚Äù with diesel fumes. 
          Diesel is just as clean as gas and burning 
          1 gallon of diesel fuel every 90 miles is 
          better for the environment than burning 1 
          gallon of gas every 30 miles. 
     F.  The ‚Äúsmelly/black fume producing‚Äù 
          reputation of diesel in america owes itself to 
          idiot US auto makers that in the 80‚Äôs tried to 
          make frankenstein diesel engines out of 
          modified gas engines and they ran like shit 
          and spewed black smoke. These atrocities    
          were unlike the clean running diesel engines 
          that were being produced in Germany at the 
          same time. 
-In summary, the EPA has been punishing European Auto makers (VW) for American auto makers‚Äô past engineering disgraces, and when VW officials got tired of being unfairly punished they decided to troll the EPA with an emissions hack. 
-They did it to slam some jimmies, not to gain      
profit or destroy the environment. 
-German authorities know this, which is why they released key players like Oliver Schmidt who was let out on parole right after he was transferred from US prison to German authorities. 
-The loss of stock value that occured from the scandal was unjustified then, and the stagnation of VW stock price since then has been unjustified in light of the fact that VW‚Äôs P/E in the last 3 months has been between 50-70 times lower than that of Tesla, and historically it has been foolish to underestimate the ability of Volkswagen to perform at the cutting edge of the industry. 
-The Emissions hack has nothing negative to say about Volkswagens fierce engineering capability and in my view it has something positive to say about the youthfulness and creativity of the company.

b) Ever rising inflation expectations due to faulty base effects that are transitory

Seems this is the MGM entertainment division...its selling in the basement of my TD Ameritrade account on the  ""Grey Market"" (that don't sound to reassuring)  @ $80 a share.

I've read that in older deals if you buy the stock in the old company when the deal is made you can get a piece of the parent company...

Is this a 9D Chess move to get some part of  the $3K plus Amazon stock in the near future for $80?

Market Cap: 550mil
Q1 revenue: 265mil
Q1 income: 6mill (compared to -111mil Q1 2020)
Cash on hand: 401mill

So historically Kodak has been on a loosing streak. But recently they have made the right moves the cut the fat, start generating profits while also strengthening their balance sheet with new investment.

Kodak has a few product lines, printers inks etc. While these generate most of Kodaks income they are also fairly stable. What is less known is kodaks history with advanced chemicals manufacturing and I expect this is where future growth will reside. 

So as it stands they are trading at 0.5x revs with almost their entire market cap in cash and making profit. That seems like a deep value play and gives them plenty of runway for growth. 

On top of that but not so important is that they have a 33% free float SI.",,

You're also moving the goalposts significantly from ""retail buys and holds 100% of AMC shares"" to a new ""they're hiding the shorts in the dark!"" Argument.

That sort of shifting avoidance of counter arguments is a hallmark strategy to avoid cognitive dissonance in an illogical position. 

AMC is so high because large institutional buyers created hype that caused trained retail cultists to believe an impossible outcome is imminent. As a result, the FOMO leads to retail funneling enormous amounts of money into sellers (who do you think people are giving $19/share to?), Who both sell impossible covered calls at huge premiums, and later let the asset slide 50% in value, booking massive profits.
