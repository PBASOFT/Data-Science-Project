>$GVSI update. The company's arrears with the Transfer Agent have now been paid in full as we move forward.

That's certainly good news for $GVSI. But this is something which GS could control the timing of; he could have paid the TA tomorrow or in a week from now – there's really no rush. But in a few hours GS has a hearing to convince a judge that $RETC is better off in his hands. Showing that he's responsible with another custodianship will only help his case in today's hearing.

Was the timing intentional? Perhaps we'll never know. But what are the chances that his handling of the $GVSI transfer agent issue will be mentioned in support of his case in the $RETC hearing?",nfjs1f,$GVSI to help $RETC hearing?

Listen... this stock is lifting off real soon. They had another success quarter posting 5 Million in revenue, 2.5 million gross. The company executives are buying up shares prior to a 23 to 1 reverse split coming within the next month. I currently hold 550k shares. I’m extremely bullish on this company and will be holding at least 80% of my shares over the next 2 years! After the RS... total company shares will only be 60 million 😁👌.. making it challenging to short! 

Below is the proof of shares acquired by leadership.
“The Company has agreed to issue, on a non-brokered basis, an aggregate of 34,205,336 common shares, at C$0.06 per share, to certain executives and directors, being 5,041,238 to Executive Chairman John Varghese and 4,941,238 to CEO Jeff Yapp, and 24,222,860 to Lead Director Rick Miller. The issuance is being assisted through a loan from a subsidiary of the Company. Each of Messrs. Varghese and Yapp had previously acquired common shares on an assisted basis will, upon issuance, hold 31,722,860 and 31,622,860 shares respectively through these arrangements. All common shares to be acquired do not have any vesting condition, and all shares previously acquired that had vesting conditions, will have such conditions waived. The purpose of the issuances is to provide the executives with a more significant financial stake in the success of the Company. The issuances have been approved by the independent directors of the Company outside of Mr. Varghese and Mr. Yapp.”",nfk8z7,Golden Leaf holdings changing name to Chalice Brands Inc due to new management success under the new product line!

They've   managed to find a way to have their current cash allow them to    continue  operations for an extra 6 months ! This means they DO NOT need    to raise  money via share dilution until NEXT YEAR!

Institutional holdings have increased over the past 30 days and is up to over 7% !

Results from two of their studies are due end of June and sometime around July!

CEO  was on Bezinga small cap conference to update on the progress of   these   studies and they appear to be going better than expected!

I  am going to be adding to my position at these super cheap prices and  I    think this can explode in the next few months if data is positive.    Even  if this doesn't work out I'll be proud I invested in an effort  to   fight  and defeat cancer!

P.S - F\*\*k cancer !!!

Even B.Riley securities had this to say

Seelos Therapeutics SLS-002 data 'overwhelmingly positive,' says B. Riley B. Riley analyst Mayank Mamtani tells investors in a research note that results from Seelos Therapeutics' Phase II Part 1 open-label cohort evaluating treatment of SLS-002 for Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior in patients with Major Depressive Disorder were ""overwhelmingly positive,"" and was particularly impressed by the key efficacy endpoints evaluating both suicidality and depression comparing favorably relative to Street expectations, reaffirming the analyst's view of mechanistic differentiation of intranasal racemic ketamine, or SLS-002, relative to esketamine. The analyst views today's intraday weakness as a ""sell-the-news"" reaction, and sees institutional buying potentially driving the stock toward the firm's $15 price target.

While Ross capital, which the person who did the negative analysis is ranked 7110 out of 7513.

P/B is < 1 which means the stock is slightly undervalued compared to the company's book value. They have a high forward P/E. Institutional ownership is a whopping 51.3%, with big upticks in Q1 and Q2, which shows faith in the company from large, conservative investors. No real catalysts expected other than: they beat earnings, and haven't really had a good COVID recovery bump yet. Plus they have a decent dividend, and they're a real American company you can feel good about investing in. I think this is a good long term hold.

Comments from White House Fact Sheet (May 18 - link above)

- The American Jobs Plan recognizes that EVs are important to the future of a strong American manufacturing base. **Securing the domestic production of EV parts, like batteries, also represents an opportunity** to shore up U.S competitiveness in a growing market, **bolster our domestic supply chain**, and create good-paying jobs in the U.S. — union jobs.

- **Incentivize the start-up of new battery production facilities**: The President’s plan proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States, recognizing that new businesses may not be able to access tax credits but can pitch in their fair share as they scale their operations.

- Scale up federally-funded research and development: The American Jobs Plan will **invest $35 billion in transformative research and development for energy and climate related topics**, of which $15 billion is specifically set aside for the Department of Energy, a leader in applied clean energy research, **including advanced batteries**. It will also invest $40 billion to upgrade research infrastructure such as laboratories and networks. The plan will increase funding in key areas to reestablish our leadership in innovation and create a pipeline of technologies that we can build here.”",,

265,,2021-05-18 23:10:42,t3_nfp8qq,,pennystocks,"TORONTO, May 17, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digihost Technology Inc. (“**Digihost**” or the “**Company**”) (TSXV: DGHI; OTCQB: HSSHF) is pleased to report that over 90% of the energy consumed by the Company in its Bitcoin (“**BTC**”) mining operations is from sources that create zero carbon emissions and more than 50% of the energy consumed by the Company is generated from renewable resources.  


The following table provides a breakdown of the sources of energy consumed by Digihost in its BTC mining operations in 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/yvz85nzvnyz61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9701f3f572d23940e3271369fa5a995d4b2f0ac

A cornerstone of Digihost’s business strategy is to continue to mine BTC in an efficient and environmentally conscious manner, thereby minimizing the Company’s carbon footprint. Digihost will assess a number of alternatives including the purchase of carbon credits to reduce its already low carbon footprint. The Company’s long-term plans for growth include vertical integration of power production from low-cost, clean and renewable sources of energy. On March 24, 2021, the Company announced the acquisition of a 60MW power plant for which it intends, to the extent possible, to source and utilize renewable natural gas and also engage in the practice of acquiring renewable energy certificates, all in line with the Company’s objective to reduce and mitigate its carbon footprint.

Michel Amar, the Company’s CEO, stated: “We are extremely proud to report that over 90% of the energy consumed by Digihost is from sources producing zero carbon emissions, and that over 50% is from renewable sources of energy, making Digihost one of the cleanest green Bitcoin mining operations in the United States. As a Company, we have always been cognizant of the potential impact Bitcoin mining could have on the environment and therefore have planned our growth and expansion to be environmentally conscious, in our pursuit of opportunities that maximize value for our shareholders.”

KYNC has been slowly building, sitting at .0153 now, higher than ICBU was when it launched. This past Friday they finally got cleared for access with the OTC, and uploaded last years finances. Yesterday they uploaded first quarter financials. Today their OTC profile was posted as “verified”. Rick makes things happen and moves fast. Attorney letter is expected any day, and pink current should happen quick. This one has been hyped for a bit, and is primed for a big run. Once pink current and the website is live, it’s on.

No one is exactly sure what Rick has in store for it, all we know is “Blockchain/NFT, Professional Sports, Entertainment, Contactless payment”. 

That’s from their Twitter header pic, which did have NBA logo on it recently, so you can see why there’s a lot of hype and speculation behind it.

The past two days have seen some consolidation from fridays run up with the news, but still held very strong from a sell off. 

I’ve had a long position on this one awhile, and also have had a large position in another account I’ve been day trading and flipping on the ride up the past two months. As of today I’m not risking flipping that account anymore. Holding because I feel any day it’s about to make the big run, and I’m not getting stuck chasing.

Has anyone had any success in finding their own edge using statistics and tracking tonnes of Pennystock data?

PLTR - possible recovery around May 13 as well

This could just be due to a rotation, however based on following the news it looks like it’s more of a reaction and change in sentiment.

NNOX might be on a recovery as well but it’s too early to tell.

This is NOT advice and all those stocks have a history of trading sideways but they’re probably worth adding to your watchlist at the very least.

They’re all stocks I’ve done my own private DD on in the past which looked promising.

PLTR is probably recovering because they smashed earnings.

PTK is probably recovering because of their JV with Xiamen (not sure I spelled that right)

And NNOX is probably recovering due to some investor conferences which restored faith after some really nasty short reports just about wiped them out (muddy waters etc).

This is just a quick observation while I have time.

Please just take this as a tip but do your own research.",nfpppi,Just looking at tickers and noticing what could potentially be some v shaped recoveries.

When a company like HITIF for example was so hyped up and pumped huge it allowed the company to generate lots of cash from offerings and media coverage that it has the possibility to get a kick start into being a good company.

338,gymy4k2,2021-05-19 00:23:44,t1_gymy4k2,t1_gymvzbp,pennystocks,"So if you’re bullish on a stock, and you want to sell an option you would sell a put. Generally a cash secured put (meaning between the premium you collect and the cash in your account you have enough available cash to secure buying 100 shares of the underlying at the given strike price). You *can* sell naked, but don’t. I would sell a put if I think the stock is going up or remaining flat, so if ATOS is $3.30/share and I sell a $3.00 put, I keep all the premium if it’s above $3.00/share at expiration. Exercising an option, in this case a short dated call on ATOS that’s already in the money (ITM), involves buying 100 shares of the underlying at the strike price. So your cost is the strike price (say $2.50) x 100 + the premium you originally paid for the option. If I paid $.20 per context my cost basis would be $2.70 per share for those 100 shares. Generally it only makes sense to exercise early if there’s very little premium left on the option, otherwise it would be financially more beneficial to simply sell the option contract, collect that premium, then buy 100 shares. Example: pay $.20 for the same call option, sell that contract before expiry for $1.05 ($105 because $1.05x100), so I’ve netted $85. If ATOS is at $3.30/share I buy 100 shares for $330 but I can subtract that profit from my cost basis, so 330-85 = $245 or $2.45/share. Better than the early exercise in that case. Hope that helps.",,

CTXR’s Mgmt team reads like an all star lineup & they have retained ownership in a significant % of shares. They have also positioned CTXR to pursue novel products in areas of need & they crushed phase 2 trials. There is a clear path to unique product in an area of need.

Despite dilution, the number of shares outstanding is still super low. Lower still when you subtract out institutional ownership.

MEDXF appears to be a small cap competing in highly competitive, saturated markets.

Low volume is a reflection of low potential for significant market share capture.

Throwing $5-$10k at CTXR has a decent chance of being a multi bagger if mino-Lok hits.

Comparatively, MEDXF does not appear to be  positioned for exponential growth. Small cap value plays don’t get folks excited. Too many things can happen to crush value that are outside their control.

To be perfectly clear, this is a list of companies I believe would give you some winning advantage going forward in investing in these related companies. This is not a complete list, but it could get you started. (I thought I posted this a couple months back but apparently it was just in the drafts folder.

Lithium producers. SQM , MALRF, ALB.  ERPNF

Lithium Development. CYDVF, LI, LIACF, LAC, SPMTF. (Ones I know... Search out more.)

Lithium Exploration - SNNAF, QMC.v, PE.v, SLL.v, BKPTF. (All Canadian companies. There are lots in all countries so look where you are...)

Cobalt Producers - S.to, FCX, LUN.to, KAT.to

Cobalt Development - EQN.to, FCO.to, CCO.to,

Cobalt Exploration - FCC.v, BKPTF, NMX.v, DM.to,

Nickle Producers - RTP, NILSY, S.to, FM.to,

Nickle Development - GMC.to, NI.to, ASN.v,

Nickle Exploration - HNC.to, DM.to, GSS.v, TLOFF (Note... Cobalt is found with Nickle and silver. Cobalt companies would go here too...)

Copper Producers - RIO, FCX, SCCO, FM.to, LUN.to

Copper Development - TRQ.to, SCCO, ERO.to. CMMC.to

Copper Exploration - SURG.v, APN.v, CN.v, WCC.v, OCO.v.

Neodymium - This one search rare earth companies. I don't know enough about these to post a breakdown of producer/developer/explorer but these companies are in the sector. - MP, NEO.to, LEM.v, UCU.v

Iron Producers - RIO, VALE, BHP, FSUGY,  NMDC

Iron Development - (Just kidding.... I don't know any companies exploring or developing for Iron... buy the producers...)

For transparency, I have shares in the following companies and have posted on most of them before. SPMT.cn/SPMTF, CYP.V/CYDVF, BKPTF/CRUZ.cse, SNNAF/SIE.v, S.to, ALB,  DM.to, RIO , LI, and PE.v.

For why I picked these ones to own, SPMTF just completed a drilling program and has a deposit, they are directly beside CYDVF who is beside ALB. CYDVF also has a deposit and ALB is the only producer of lithium in North America. So it is an area play. In the area as well is BKPTF, PE.v and SNNAF. PE.v is currently drilling lithium brine and the other two are directly beside them. If one hits they all hit and they are really cheap ATM. S.to and BKPTF have Cobalt and will run on that alone but both also have other resources that is not as obvious including Nickle, Silver and others. DM.to will move with nickle and RIO is a huge produces of several of these commodities. I think that covers it. Bar non, CRUZ/BKPTF is my easiest trade as I think it will double in a few weeks.

I know there are lots of companies I have not listed so add your picks with some DD to help others get some wins. Market is turning green so lets get some tendies... Just remember, while some of these are great short term plays several you want to hold long term. You job is to know the difference. I think they all will outperform the market over a few years...",nfu4fo,EV Battery Metal and De-Carbonization plays - My list...

You forgot to mention that the defense's main argument was centered around an 8K that they claim ""proved"" they were responsibly operating a business... illegally. It was at least an hour after this that the judge had to point out that the attorney for the defense had never entered that supposedly vital piece of material as evidence. 

You also forgot that the expert witness presented by the defense was unable to answer the most basic questions about the company, including whether or not they had filed their taxes for the last two years, or even name a single one of the twelve employees she testified to working with for long hours every day for the past few years. 

The defense attorney asked multiple questions based on incorrect facts, and became noticeably flustered when the errors were pointed out to him. He also, at one point, had to be coached by the judge because he was unable to reword his own question in a way that wouldn't be immediately objected to (and sustained).

Was George a shining star? No, of course not. He became obviously impatient with the defense attorney, and he talked too much, including answering questions directed to his own attorney.

It went through a corporate action and that new position appears to currently be delisted. When they are not trading under a symbol, they are shown as that registration number. We cannot say what the company may do in the future, but right now those shares are not trading.”

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Because of scheduling (I'm 10 times zones ahead), it was too late for me to listen to the whole thing, so I only caught the beginning of Sharp's testimony, so I really can't respond directly (although the little bit I heard wan't that bad).

As the judge pointed out, the company is on trial here. The fact that Sharp's emails don't sound professional really has nothing to do with whether or not the company is active. The testimony of the comptroller — at least when she wasn't being questioned by friendly counsel — was embarassing. It would certainly help Sharp's case if he came off as super-duper competent, but at the end of the day he may end up getting the custodianship not because he wins, but because RETC loses.",,

569,gyo546j,2021-05-19 07:23:43,t1_gyo546j,t3_nfu4fo,pennystocks,"LAC - Thacker Pass should be the best sedimentary Lithium asset in North America. Ganfeng just announced they may build a battery plant in Argentina where they also own a Lithium mine w/ LAC. Potentially huge news. I personally like their Arizona plant a lot though (Thacker Pass) as the US wants to get their metals here. It's been called a matter of national security. PLL & LTHM are of interest here also.

PDAC - SPAC taking Li-Cycle public, which has amazing technology and connections.

WWR - Graphite (and USA). 

ABML - Another recycler with some great tech located near Tesla.

NNOMF - Nano One has technology that auto manufacturers need. For further reading look up their NMC811 breakthrough technology. 

I'm biased as I have all of these stocks. They've done really well for me and I hope they move higher soon. Most have been amazing for me. They've all been hit really hard lately. LAC is one of my favorites but you won't get rich overnight with it and they won't be producing until next year. That said, it has a lot of $20-$30 targets on it and it they should be coming online as Lithium demand continues to surge. IMO PDAC got crushed with all the other SPACs but is a solid company. ABML & NNOMF probably have very bright futures. ABML was .20 not long ago and it is shooting for NASDAQ up-listing in 2021. You can't be green without recycling. WWR was $12 not long ago. 

Oh, be sure to check out TSNP & GOMRF for rare earth.. 

Lots of great companies in this space. If they start to perform anything like they did a few months ago again soon, I'll be really happy.",,

717,,2021-05-19 12:14:08,t3_ng45wu,,pennystocks,"Sienna announces Arctic Drilling AS of Norway will be conducting the drill program on the Bleka project.

The Bleka Project is located in an under explored green-stone belt in southern Norway with areas of historic gold production and well documented gold occurrences. The  Bleka Vein was discovered in 1880 and mined intermittently until 1940,  with historic production reported as 165 kilograms (i.e., \~ 5,300 troy  ounces) of gold sourced from mineralized material with an average grade  of **36 g/t** gold. The project covers the historic mining area and  swarms of similar veins that extend for at least three kilometres along  strike. To understand this specific area and this deposit it is good to know that it is an orogenic formation with a folded nose type of deposit. These are created when the the earth was forming and the plates were converging creating a subduction zone and an area that was being up-thrust and rolled in to a tight layered formation. This type of formation has been responsible for many of the significant deposits located around the world.

The company has a project deck to help explain this better than I can here. [https://www.siennaresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SIE-Deck-Bleka-Vekselmyr-2020-1.pdf](https://www.siennaresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SIE-Deck-Bleka-Vekselmyr-2020-1.pdf)

With this announcement Sienna will being their work program on this project within this month and should be able to provide updates as the work progresses. This an exciting, near surface project which should be very good for both the company and shareholders. All targets are shallow (Less than 100') and as you can see from the link, there are many to choose from in this area. I have been told there should be 6-7 holes on this program and if warranted, the company would expect to increase that number significantly once the results are know.

[https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/sienna-engages-arctic-drilling-norway-070100540.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/sienna-engages-arctic-drilling-norway-070100540.html)

With the instability of other investments, this project and gold seems to be a good place to invest at this time.  I hope you find the information helpful. This is not investment advise. Yes I have 100k shares. Please do some DD on this one. I think it could do very well over the course of the summer on this and it's other projects. This company is very open to answering questions for investors so if you have any, I would call them.  This one trades most of it's volume on the Venture but is listed on OTC and Frankfurt exchanges.",ng45wu,$SIE.v/$SNNAF - Sienna Resources Announces drilling company for Bleka Project. 0.105/.092

Amedeo Air Four Plus Ltd. said Wednesday that Thai Airways International PCL's rehabilitation plan has been approved by the creditors committee. 

The London-listed specialist fund --which acquires, leases and sells aircraft-- said that it will now continue to negotiate and agree binding lease-amendment documentation with the airline on a power-by-the-hour basis. The company said it will do this before moving to a fixed-rate lease for the remaining term, including an extension from the original term. 

Amedeo said it continued to target June or July to document and effect the restructuring of debt with its lenders. 

Early in May the board said that it believed that the eventual resumption of Thai Airways' payments, as well as an agreement on long-term debt restructuring, would result in Amedeo being in a stronger position than if it allowed the debt to default, which would result in the repossession of aircraft leased to the airline.",,

770,gyox7js,2021-05-19 13:06:27,t1_gyox7js,t3_nfa07g,pennystocks,"Ideanomics, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDEX) shareholders will have a reason to smile today, with the covering analyst making substantial upgrades to this year's forecasts. Consensus estimates suggest investors could expect greatly increased statutory revenues and earnings per share, with the analyst modelling a real improvement in business performance. The market seems to be pricing in some improvement in the business too, with the stock up 9.7% over the past week, closing at US$2.83. Could this big upgrade push the stock even higher?  
  
Following the upgrade, the current consensus from analysts is for revenues of US$129m in 2021 which - if met - would reflect a substantial 119% increase on its sales over the past 12 months. The loss per share is anticipated to greatly reduce in the near future, narrowing 84% to US$0.05. However, before this estimates update, the consensus had been expecting revenues of US$105m and US$0.11 per share in losses. We can see there's definitely been a change in sentiment in this update, with the analyst administering a sizeable upgrade to this year's revenue estimates, while at the same time reducing their loss estimates.  
  
Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. For example, we noticed that Ideanomics' rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with revenues forecast to exhibit 184% growth to the end of 2021 on an annualised basis. That is well above its historical decline of 2.6% a year over the past five years. Compare this against analyst estimates for the broader industry, which suggest that (in aggregate) industry revenues are expected to grow 13% annually. So it looks like Ideanomics is expected to grow faster than its competitors, at least for a while.",,

Melbourne, Florida--(Newsfile Corp. - May 19, 2021) -  Kona Gold Beverage, Inc. (OTCQB: KGKG), a holding company focused on product development in the better-for-you and hemp and CBD functional beverage sector, is pleased to announce net revenues through May of fiscal year 2021 has surpassed net revenues for the total fiscal year 2020. The Company recently posted its 10-Q with approximately $462,000 in net revenues, which is approximately a 129% increase from the same period quarter last year.

Kona Gold Beverage recently announced it anticipates second quarter revenues to be approximately $750,000, which it now anticipates to hit by mid-June. This would make Q2 the Company's largest quarterly revenues in the Company's history. Additional closings of additional partnerships that the Company is currently working on could push Q2 revenues close to $1 million, which would be a huge milestone for the Company. The Company anticipates a gross profit of approximately 30% from these revenues.

""I am excited to share with our stock holders the phenomenal growth we are experiencing in 2021, which has been fueled by the acquisition of our lemonade brand, Ooh La Lemin in early 2021,"" stated Robert Clark, CEO of Kona Gold Beverage, Inc. ""Since the inception of Kona Gold Beverage, our goal has been to create products that resonate with consumers on a national scale, and we are executing on that goal. Our focus is to continue expanding, grow market share, and make our beverage portfolio available to everyone at their local retailer across the U.S. Our strategy will not only continue to increase bottom line revenue, but also shareholder value.""

Kona Gold Beverage recently received its largest purchase order to date. The purchase order, which came in from a new vendor, and was for the Company's Ooh La Lemin Lemonade, was approximately $250,000. The new vendor, which has over 300 stores across 15 states in the Midwestern united states, will receive half a pallet of Ooh La Lemin Lemonade for each store. The Company is working to fulfill this order in the next couple of weeks.",ng6x8x,"Kona Gold Beverage, Inc. Announces Revenues Through May of 2021 Have Surpassed All Revenue of 2020"

973,,2021-05-19 15:34:23,t3_ng90be,,pennystocks,"New rules will affect your ability to buy and sell “Pink No Information” securities, including at E*TRADE 

On September 28, 2021, new requirements take effect that will impact the market for—and value of—certain “over-the-counter (OTC) securities” you currently hold or have held in the past. The new rules apply to “Pink No Information” OTC securities of companies that fail to publicly report and keep current financial and other company information and will restrict the ability of U.S. brokers, like E*TRADE from making these products generally available. 

Some background on the new requirements 

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently adopted amendments to SEC Rule 15c2-11 governing the submission and publication of OTC quotations. These amendments will prohibit broker-dealers from submitting or publicly disseminating bid/ask quotations for OTC securities of issuers that do not meet enhanced information filing requirements. 

Securities of issuers that make the required information publicly available by the deadline in the rule should not be affected. 

What these changes mean for you 

Starting September 28, 2021, you will no longer be able to buy or sell “Pink No Information” OTC securities through E*TRADE. Other restrictions related to the purchase of these securities may apply sooner. Please keep in mind that the upcoming changes will negatively affect the value of any “Pink No Information” OTC securities you hold now or in the future. 

Have you guys seen this for those who buy OTC on E*TRADE? What do I do with my pennies on E*TRADE?",ng90be,E*TRADE OTC stocks

989,,2021-05-19 15:48:15,t3_ng9cj1,,pennystocks,"I’ve been going through news about PPE & publicly traded PPE companies like DuPont (DD), 3M (MMM), Owens & Minor (OMI), and Optec but I did some research on $OPTI.

Current Value(11:30am today) $.061

OPTEC has products like UV cleaning lights and fuel maximizers for commercial transportation but it seems like they’re looking to expand their PPE services. I saw on Yahoo that OPTEC entered into an Exclusive Distribution Agreement with Rafina Innovations Inc. - a Medical and Pharmaceutical development company with offices in Glasgow and Athens. Per the press release, the agreement gives Rafina an exclusive right to distribute OPTEC products.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rafina-innovations-inc-announces-brand-123700237.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rafina-innovations-inc-announces-brand-123700237.html)

OPTEC CEO says:

“We are very happy to have Rafina as an exclusive distributor for the Cyprus territory to expand our product lines to this medical/pharmaceutical region and particularly in the Ocean-Going Vessel Shipping sectors. We look forward to further expanding our cooperation with Rafina in this region.”

It reads to me like OPTEC is working to tap into the commercial trading sector with more than their fuel maximizer, perhaps leveraging existing relationships to sell PPE? Either way, it's interesting to see the company looking to expand distribution in the Mediterranean, and especially in the ocean-going shipping industry. We all saw what happened to cruise ships early on in the Pandemic. Shipping looks like an industry that will maintain strict PPE requirements because they have much to lose if an outbreak occurred on a vessel at sea. I’m curious to see updates from this partnership down the road. 

Another PPE partnership to note is OPTEC’s acquisition of PPE supplier WeShield. I’ve seen the acquisition talked about a bit on other threads and I’m happy to see another PPE related update from OPTEC. I assume the company is likely strategizing how best to work in the PPE space as the nation is entering into the recovery phase from COVID. I think my next research project will be maritime COVID safety and what that market looks like.",ng9cj1,PPE Supply and $OPTI Recent Partnerships with Rafina Innovations
