Royal Helium or $RHC is a Canada based pure play in Helium exploration. While stocks like Avanti Energy and Desert Mountain Energy have gone up wildly, Royal Helium is still comparably cheap, although

* they found a massive helium reservoir,
* will most likely start production in 2021,
* have THE largest land package of all of the helium companies.

The size of the land package of 1,000,000 acres is only second to North American Helium, that‚Äòs a successful, yet unfortunately privately held company.

So I guess people are focussing too much on the wider spread headlines of those smaller companies, but Royal Helium has a much bigger headstart.

Currently valued at CAD 78MM they are looking at a business case (lower case) of at least CAD 165MM revenues with their current reserves discovered and crude helium sales at the well.

Also, they secured a CAD 15MM financing round in a bought deal, meaning money is safe and they can go into further developing wells.

Their Twitter channel is pretty informative and I really like the team!

What‚Äòs your take on this and the other companies? To my knowledge there are

* Royal Helium
* Imperial Helium (IPOed recently)
* Desert Mountain Energy
* Avanti Energy
* American Helium

as relevant players. if you got that sector on the radar, let me know your take!",nlcets,Royal Helium // North American Helium Industry

Perhaps Thiel recognized the value of data integration at PayPal but PLTR was founded significantly through Cohen, Thiel, Lonsdale, and Gettings. Karp got brought in as interim CEO and ended up being such a good fit that he was kept on as acting CEO.

That said, agree with your reasoning for why PLTR will be a giant in the marketplace, their potential success within government and it's timeliness with AI investment in the west to keep pace with China. Also believe people are underestimating the commercial growth they are likely to see. Very exciting company, I am essentailly all in as well.

71,gzqh3bm,2021-05-28 07:46:59,t1_gzqh3bm,t1_gzp1qt7,StockMarket,"I don't even know how you can claim this bullshit. Short interest on AMC has been floating below 20%, and more than likely ~5% of those shorts are retail shorts betting on the asset going back to the norm, so maybe just maybe there's an institutional short volume of 10-15% on AMC, not nearly enough to cause any sort of short squeeze. 

I very do much agree the recent uptick in price is caused mostly by the options chain expiring ITM and retail pumping it, but the most AMC could be with all 10-15% of those shorts covering at once would maybe be $35-40 total given the massive sell volume, but they won't cover all at once, and it'll probably decline tomorrow. 

No one was selling GME, more AMC today was sold than the top 500 companies. GME had a greater short interest than there was available to buy, while AMC just has a small fraction of what is available to buy. 

The whole purpose of a short squeeze on the caliber of 500-1000% gains is having to buy up the whole ask side of the order book, they don't have to do this with AMC, as there's enough volume to only increase the price a bit while covering the entire position.

If you do your research you‚Äôll probably be right, BUT, it may be the time for a correction, in that case use the correction to DCA, and patience will pay.
As an example, I did my research in $DLTR in NOV19 and bought at 91.46$, convinced on my research I DCAed on FEB20 at 87.14$.
Then Pandemic came and I sold, losing nearly 4k$, thinking we were going to die all.
Months later, I realised that if I had sticked to my plan, and DCAed more in ABR20, I would have made nearly 6k$ in AGO20 and 9k$ in ABR21.
That patience would have been 900$/month of profit.

92,gzqj7f8,2021-05-28 08:19:08,t1_gzqj7f8,t1_gzp4s6z,StockMarket,"No, improve your TA.  TA is not end all be all, it gives you probabilities and gameplans you for exits and entries.   But most important exits.
You need profit targets and the most CRUCIAL part to a trading plan.....A stop loss.
Have to stop that will say ‚Äúif my TA fails and I am wrong i will exit here‚Äù

You say your charting is perfect, but yet you are bag holding.

I‚Äôll give you an example how i traded BNGO yesterday. 
I saw Bngo consolidating within a tight bull flag on the 30 min at around 6.03-6.07 before market opened.  I built out a position at 6.04.
Now on why i love bull flags, is because your stops can be a little tighter.  If this flags fail, under 5.95 i can say this pattern will fail and i can exit here for 9 cent loss.  

Pattern fails, i get stopped out around 100 dollar loss, about 1/3 my max loss.
I reevaluate the play.  Market all tanked at open but then show signs of strength on the dip, so i built a position on the next dip. 5.88 with a 5.76 stop.  1 cent under the low of the day , so if it hits my stop im either changing to short because the trend is now downside or i move on to a different play.

Bngo runs up to 6.20 i make up my losses and then some and im holding to 1/3 shares of my current shares to see how far it will go with my stop at my break even.

Its ok to be wrong, im stopped out often, thats a good thing.  Now if you are constantly getting stopped out, then your TA actually sucks.

When it comes to trading, you have to think about how much you want to lose  FIRST",,

They can continue to deposit enough money to meet their margin requirement and eventually hope for the stock to fall in price then cover right? It's not like the money they're required to deposit will vanish; it's just a margin requirement to maintain their short position. 

If I was an average Joe and used 100k and opened up a short position, it would make sense to cover at a loss as I probably won't have funds enough to maintain my short position.

My strategy is to first check 1 month chart with daily intervals.  I plot the upper and lower levels of the channel that SPY seems to bounce around in.  I wait for 3 different signals to give me the go:  When it reaches near the bottom of the channel, when MACD begins to reverse, and when SQZ MOMO begins to reverse or revert to the green.  At this point I buy call contracts for the next monthly expiry 30+ days out.

I find that SPY has enough liquidity that can I can often times even do a market order and have a nonexistent spread.  If it makes a big move, often times I will take profits and reopen a later expiry if there's still room to grow.  It's not subject (as greatly) to bad earnings calls, dividend payout dates, bad news within a company, and a bunch of other common causes for volatility.  Just be aware of the state of the economy (which is easier to keep up with compared to dozens of tickers with varying important dates).

I‚Äôm doing the same with a few other meme and high short-interest stocks which could see rapid gains in a short amount of time on the hype. I already made quick gains on JMIA, SPCE, and BYND. My strategy is always to have a stop loss I‚Äôm OK with, take partial profits on any jump up, and constantly raise stops as price appreciates. I also keep my position size small compared to my total portfolio. 

As a part of the general market I think the moves back to meme stocks is because people are frustrated where stocks are still bottoming and consolidating. The crypto correction has sent traders looking for wild gains elsewhere. This is causing rushes into smaller names wherever momentum starts to pick up and it means the moves could be short-lived. 

Markets get more and more wild as a top happens. Then it seems like just another dip when a decline has really begun. At this stage of the bull market while I‚Äôm being aggressive when the moment is right I will prioritize safety and honor my stops if things don‚Äôt go as I hope.

If it was me, I would sell 3/4 and let some house money ride, assuming I was as confident as you in AMC. With meme stocks, you're not going to get significantly rich buying less than 50-100 shares. To turn a 220 investment into 10k, you needed to get in on options instead of buying those shares.

Also they have massive amounts of cash they're extremely financially healthy go look at their last financial statements. They have almost no liabilities at all it's just lending rates are so cheap they basically would be irresponsible not to borrow a little and compared to the cash they have it's nothing. 

You realize that they're issuing that amount of shares because of how much they know they're growing and about to grow. It's because their current prospects are that good. You realize giving stocks to executives like Karp is how they become a public company right?? They give him X amount of overall shares and that represents his previous ownership from when they were private..... stock based compensation isn't like the company spending money lmao. It's also only worth billions because of the share prices of what the public investors are willing to pay... Regardless its not coming out of the companies pocket and it's a fixed amount of total dilution that was decided on before they DPO'd.... 

They don't sell shares on the market and then give the cash to employees.... that's not what sbc is... sbc is the best way for people NOT to cash out early....

If you even read my post you'd realize that NOONE is cashing out. I mean I don't think you read a single thing I said. It's almost pathetic. They have a normal stake in their company. They're not squandering anything. Thiel talks about stock based compensation as being the best way to motivate employees because they have the most incentive to make the company better. Insiders aren't selling large amounts of their total shares you just don't understand basic math and apparently neither do the 30 people that upvoted you. It's not just executives getting stock either it's all employees engineers and sales people everyone has a long term incentive....",,

I ask because it seems as though there are many conflicting schools of thought on the subject. I've also anecdotally experienced placing a trailing stop order only to watch the price of the stock I selected tank and reverse right on the level I selected many times (EMAs, SMAs)

I feel as though it is tinfoil hat misinformation that funds will pay/can see all the trailing stop orders in the market and will manipulate the price to stop retail traders out - though this is a theory I have read on this sub often.

I'm not new to the stock market but I started trading Cryptocurrency in 2015. I've learned what works best for me is to set my goals from the beginning and try to stick with that original goal as much as possible and be happy.

OTCQB: TRYPF

Recently, it was announced that the cannabis industry titan, GW Pharmaceuticals , was being acquired by Jazz Pharmaceuticals for $7.2 billion. Looking back to May of 2013 when GW first went public, it was trading at $8.90 - a mere fraction of its current market valuation of over $215 per share. At this time, the thought that the small cannabidiol company would later be the target of a 10-figure acquisition was one few saw coming.

However, those who saw the future growth potential of this industry player that forever changed the global cannabis market have been handsomely rewarded for their foresight. Although you may be too late for the cannabis sector, a similar boom in the psychedelic industry is just starting.

TRYP Therapeutics is one of the industry‚Äôs growing leaders within the psychedelic sector that many predict is following in the footsteps of GW, positioned to mirror its success.

The article can be seen below but these are the main reasons they vouch for Tryp's success:

* They are trying to break the stigma surrounding psychedelic treatments
* They are expanding their pipeline to include many different treatments from competitors
* Extensive Experience in Big Pharma
* Targeting more rare disorders that have a high demand for treatment

Similar to GW Pharma, Tryp Therapeutics is an American pharmaceutical company located in the biotech hotbed of San Diego, an area of Southern California, focused on researching and treating illnesses through synthesizing and legitimizing naturally occurring compounds for the treatment of rare diseases.

Not sure if you guys in the adult stock subs are aware but GME has maintained an average between 10x and 100x it‚Äôs 52 week low for the last 5 months. 

In recent news, they have seemingly solved the biggest problem of the gaming industry, digital resale of games using NFTs.  

Despite recent developments, Wall Street speculators continue to short it, probably because they don‚Äôt understand the tech behind crypto well enough and they also think they can trick us into selling. 

I think GME is still undervalued at 250 given the potential of their team with the amount of cash they have, but as an added bonus they are set up to squeeze like we have never seen due to the amount at which they were shorted at 3, 10, 40, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 dollars.

406,,2021-05-28 15:30:14,t3_nn0cl4,,StockMarket,"Maybe many of you never heard of Pinduoduo because the company main target is in China, not the people outside China. Their app and website don‚Äôt even have any language other than Simplified Chinese. However, it is a public company listed in the US stock market. Pinduoduo  an e-commerce platform. It offers a suite of product categories just like Amazon and Walmart in the US.

**The Numbers Seem Impossible Yet It is**

**We do believe whatever in the 26 May, 2021 quarterly financial report is definitely real. However, even we do believe it is real, still it raises some concerns to the company.** 

***We do assume no one is using Pinduoduo outside China.*** 

**The User Numbers**

It stated that the average monthly active users in the quarter was 724.6 million. Also, the monthly active users refers to the number of user accounts that visited the Pinduoduo mobile app during a given month, which does not include those that accessed the platform through social networks and access point.

Active buyers on Pinduoduo in the 12-month period ended March was about 824 million. Active buyers refers to the number of user accounts that placed one or more orders, regardless of whether the products and services are actually sold, delivered or returned.

However, let‚Äôs compare some well known e-commerce companies in China. Alibaba has 811 million active buyers, and JD has 499 million active buyers. The last two definitely have more people know outside or within China. Even a lesser know Meituan has 510.6 million paying users and you do see their delivery bicycles on every street in China. They are also all having much longer history than Pinduoduo. 

What is the concept of 824 million in China alone, let‚Äôs quote the Chinese Official data. 

Chinese netizens have 898 million in 2020. The internet availability rate was 70.4%. A total of 986 million Chinese used mobile phones to surf the internet, accounting for 99.7 percent of the online population. Around 309 million, or 31.3% of the online population, live in rural areas.

Which means more than 90% people in China who have internet access are using Pinduoduo and made a purchase on the website or the app within this 12 month period. It included part of those those around 300 million people who lived in rural areas and there monthly salary is less than $2000 RMB ($314). 

**Underweight**

**We are not by any means questioning the authenticity of the report, we do believe it is real.**

However, there would not be a huge growth rate for Pinduoduo active users. The average revenue per user is just one-fifth of Alibaba‚Äôs because Pinduoduo targets the lower end users, and the way they attract users is by giving them a subsidiary (coupons or cash equivalent) to keep their products price lower than other e-commerce platform. That‚Äôs just like burning money no matter which way you see it. It can be doing that forever. Because of that, many big brands are hesitant, if not, unwilling to open an official online flagship store in Pinduoduo. Hence, these are the reasons why we believed that Pinduoduo stock price is overpriced by a lot.",nn0cl4,Almost Impossible Number For Pinduoduo PDD

1: Having a position in a stock in no way shape or form makes a source of information untrustworthy. There's no such thing as bias here there is being wrong about your information and being right about your information. If anything those (in this situation me) have the most to lose have done the most research so my ""bias"" aka my interest in the stock is just that. Interest in the stock. I didn't buy it and then develop bias I researched it and therefore saw a reason to buy it. 

If consider someone doing research and therefore gaining conviction in why a stock is worth buying as a sense of something not to be distrusted than you're going to have a really hard time in markets over the long term. 

Just because people have written say 10 bear cases and 10 bull cases doesn't mean that there's no real answer or even that the answer is somewhere in the middle because they were both ""biased"" . The answer is one of them is correct and it's about the quality of information they found. High quality information of course gives me a ""bias"" of being bullish. But it doesn't have any relevance or relation to the accuracy of my information. 

You can check my information in a few short minutes and discover that it is accurate. You just don't like someone calling you out for having an absurdly uninformed opinion. 

You can claim its defensiveness all you want but no its not having an appetite for LOW QUALITY information which is what you're putting out. It's not because I'm biased it's because I know with 100% pure certainty that you're wrong. Because I've done the research. If me doing intensive quality research makes me ""biased"" then that's the dumbest thing I've ever had. 

Stocks don't go up based on belief. I don't buy stocks on belief. I do research and develop probabilities in my head and buy based on my risk/returns that fit my goals and situation. 

Your information was entirely wrong and I'm not being defensive by pointing it out. People who point out flat eathers are wrong aren't being defensive but if they seem incredulous at the level of misinformation that gets out then that's just an externality of how wrong they are. My incredulity which you are painting as defensiveness is just a factor of how incorrect you are. If anything you're the one being defensive by turning the debate about my ""personality' and painting me as biased because I've done actual research. 

If you were right you had literally ample time to prove me wrong it would've taken minutes, instead you sit here claiming I can't be trusted because I'm vested in a company that I've put actual 100s of hours of research into. Like duh. No I have better information because I'm so invested. I'd be an idiot not to do research on something I've put so much money into. 

Also if you think me making a post on reddit is actually going to get me significant gains on a stock of a 30 billion dollar company than you clearly are insane. What reason do I have to convince people on here? There's thousands of posts every week. Mine isn't needed I just see so much dump posts that are completely incorrect like YOUR comment that I wanted to set the record straight. The fact that your only response has been to call me defensive and biased and untrustworthy instead of pointing to ANY tangible information of why my information is incorrect just proves 100x over that I'm at least way more informed than you on the topic. 

Good luck and I hope you learn to digest information based on quality comparisons of tangible proofs rather than relying on your personal beliefs about someone's tone of the text they wrote on the fucking internet and your Freudian analysis of my intentions. Like woah the guy who wrote pages of DD on palantir thinks its going up???? Mind blown. Guess he's wrong because he has conviction enough to buy the stock based on all his work he put in üòÇüòÇüòÇ",,

It's almost always close to correct, but usually wrong by percentages. For instance with GME, it was reported that the estimated short interest 2 weeks after the first squeeze in January was still over 100%. When the SEC finally reported, it showed it was less than 40%. Therefore, 100% of the short volume closes their positions, but estimations weren't aware of that, and chose to believe they didn't. 

Also, keep in mind that gamma squeezes on volatile stocks like this are almost non existent, why? Most options are covered calls and PUTs on volatile assets, meaning they have already bought the shares a long time ago, and just transfer them when they expire. When you exercise a PUT for the right to buy shares at that price, you're 99% likely to not actually buy the shares, but to receive them by someone who bought them when they sold you the contract months ago. 

If your cost basis is as low as you think it is, sell today. Even if you're bullish still on AMC against all odds, remember that we have a 3 day weekend and that usually isn't good for volatility, people will likely sell off today EOD and buy back on Monday, you should take profit now and buy back lower if you truly believe.",,

(Bloomberg) -- The copper market, unlike oil, is supported by a dearth of new discoveries at a time of rising demand that will accelerate with decarbonization efforts, according to the world‚Äôs biggest publicly traded producer of the metal.

While government and market actions can have an impact in the short term, copper is a very long term business and is ‚Äúextraordinarily strong,‚Äù Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson said in an interview Thursday.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no shale oil for copper,‚Äù he told Bloomberg Television. ‚ÄúUnlike the oil industry, where you have an ongoing flow of discoveries and now with a new element of shale coming in, copper mines of size are very rare to find.‚Äù

Bets on tight supplies have sent copper prices to record levels as major economies emerge from the pandemic and the energy transition boosts the outlook for the metal used in electric installations. The rally has cooled somewhat with the outlook of a tapering by the U.S. Federal Reserve and China‚Äôs efforts to ease a commodities price surge.

The industry is facing a supply scarcity that will require both copper substitution and increasing recycling, Adkerson said. If prices were to double tomorrow, Freeport would be unable to bring on new supply within five years, he said.

Freeport‚Äôs margins are expanding as near-record prices and a ramp-up at its flagship mine in Indonesia counter any cost increases. The company has ‚Äúits arms around‚Äù input supply challenges, he said.

Host nation politicians and unions seeking a bigger share of the copper windfall is a typical response to surging prices, he said.

That's not the case at all. I'm just trying to share my viewpoint on this stock that I feel doesn't get enough love. WSB gatekeepers threw me off that sub because this is ***not*** a pump & dump. So I picked up and moved over here.

This seems like the kind of comment in the same ballpark as ""This band... all their stuff sounds the same.""  
Well, yeah. It's the same 4 dudes with the same 4 instruments who wrote all of the songs in the same 2-month span. Of course all of the shit on that album sounds the same.  
Yeah... I took the same information over to a sub that wouldn't kick me out because my post wasn't meme-worthy enough, and people who are interested in the same kind of information or the same company or the same writing style seem to be leaving the same kind of comments.

To imply that such a thing is nefarious is to totally ignore that every GME and AMC post on WSB has basically the same kind of comments on them as well.  


What I also find odd about the WSB gatekeeping is that they were saying RVP wasn't overnight-success-worthy and that the market cap wasn't quite right.

Let's assume you buy Cathie's arguments about deflation being what will happen in the future (e.g. technological deflation), shouldn't you keep cash?  


I like her argument, but I find it contradictory to the global idea that we should invest instead of keeping cash on the sideline (because of arguments like ""time in the market is better than timing the market""). I feel like there's a missing piece to the puzzle that I haven't been able to put my finger on yet.  


Let's say a TV used to cost $1000 50 years ago. If you did nothing but keep cash, you'd be able to buy 2 TVs of the same quality today at $500 each, or 3 at $333 each.

Their phones are stagnating, no innovation. They‚Äôre selling based on prestige but even that‚Äôs tapering off significantly and they‚Äôre having a hard time in China. They need to capture China and India if they want to keep the iPhone relevant well into the future.

Their services are mediocre. Apple Music is great but Spotify is still the clear winner in that space, Apple TV (streaming not the box) sucks. Netflix, HBO, Disney, Paramount, Amazon all have a better selection of shows.

MacBook sucks, iPad innovation is ok

Apple Watch is the only real growth prospect the company has right now. Health and well being tech but there‚Äôs really no clear sign Apple is going to completely pivot into this aside from enhanced Apple Watch capabilities.

Apple Store lawsuit with Epic doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôll end well for Apple. At the minimum they‚Äôre not going to get away with keeping the status quo.

The market has made a remarkable recovery, particularly in technology, after the market tumbled 4% following the April Consumer Price Index roughly two weeks ago. In my view, as I have said for weeks, the recovery in the market confirms that the initial sell-off driven by inflationary fears forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected was overblown.

New government data on Friday showed personal income fell less than expected in April, but still pulled back after March's stimulus-fueled surge. Personal income fell by 13.1% in April compared to March, less than the 14.2% drop expected. This follows a 20.9% increase during March which had been buoyed by the distribution of $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans. 

In another report, the Department of Commerce reported core personal consumption expenditures increased 3.1% in April from a year earlier, blowing past the Fed‚Äôs traditional 2% target. Federal Reserve members consider the core PCE to be the gauge of inflation. The strong inflation readings reported by the Commerce Department on Friday had been widely anticipated as the pandemic's grip eases, thanks to vaccinations, and will have no impact on monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that higher inflation will be transitory. Supply-chain constraints combined, labor shortages in certain industries, and rising demand as the US economy recovers from the coronavirus-induced recession have all contributed to higher inflationary readings. These are all factors that are widely considered transitory, meaning not permanent. In an April 28 statement, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said, ‚ÄúAn episode of one-time price increases as the economy reopens is not likely to lead to persistent year-over-year inflation into the future. Clogged supply-chains won‚Äôt affect Federal Reserve policy because they‚Äôre temporary and expected to resolve themselves.‚Äù Moreover, he said ‚ÄúFor inflation to move up in a persistent way that moves expectations up, that would take some time, and you would think it would be likely we would be in very strong employment for that to happen.‚Äù In other words, Powell is saying he expects issues driving inflation higher to resolve themselves moving forward and doesn‚Äôt expect inflationary pressures to materialize until the labor market further improves.

In remarks this week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be ‚Äúmostly temporary‚Äù and that the Fed was ‚Äúnot quite there yet‚Äù when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be ‚Äúoverly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.‚Äù 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Fed, offered a slightly different view but one that is in-line with what the Federal Reserve has already said publicly in the past. Clarida said, ‚Äúthere will come a time in upcoming meetings‚Äù when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that ‚Äúit is going to depend on the flow of data‚Äù. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn‚Äôt worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, ‚ÄúWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.‚Äù

The Department of Labor‚Äôs Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week to yet another pandemic-era low, an encouraging sign that the labor market is improving following the extremely disappointing April Jobs report, which showed 266,000 new jobs added in the month, far below estimated of more than 1 million and a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March.

Exactly, plenty of money chasing the same goods = higher prices = inflation.
Of course nothing is that black or white, thus so many variables to the equation.
My crystal ball sees inflation, so i personally would stay away from things with any amount of Ark and continue to hold both growth and value companies.
By growth I mean something with real earnings.

I laid out completely how that's not happening in the last half of the post. I've detailed it in multiple comments. I've mentioned videos that detail what is going on with the selling claims. There's literally beyond an abundance of evidence that this is incorrect. 

They're as dedicated to their company as any leadership in the workd and they're still completely engaged in the long run. No one at the top has sold any amount or shares that represents even remotely a significant portion of their ownership. 99% of selling was automated sales done by their lawyers for the taxes on the ownership of their shares as granted by the vested stock options that simply represent their share of the company that they had when it was private then becoming public. 

When you own 5% of a company that goes public and is worth 30 billion dollars the government says you owe taxes on the SHARES that you recieved as they went public. You owe taxes in CASH on the shares. We're talking taxes that are owed on the entire sum of what their shares are worth. So they owe cash for the taxes on the SHARES that are worth billions and they have to pay cash that they don't have. So they do automated selling of shares that works well within the SEC guidelines in order to pay the taxes in CASH that the government says they owe for their shares of the company becoming shares of stock.",,

885,,2021-05-28 23:11:37,t3_nna7ej,,StockMarket,"Market Status: Uptrend (5/5)

The stock market's strength ended on a good note this week. On the upside, it looks like two distribution days will fall off the map for the $QQQ next week and three for the $SPY. At the same time, three distribution days will become less significant for both the $SPY and $QQQ next week. That is a good sign and should lead to a ramping up in buying power from institutions. The only way we will lose this momentum is if we gain a lot more distribution days next week. 

During market uptrends, you have the home-field advantage, so the scene is perfect for buying and making profits. Please keep in mind that even though things are looking good, the market loves to give surprises and turn quickly, so taking precautions to protect yourself, such as using a stop-loss, is essential to success. It is more profitable to ask yourself, ""How much could I lose?"" rather than ""How much can I gain?""

What should really be talked about here is this....
Stocks trade at rough multiples of their revenue, earnings, and cash flow. Its that simple. Increase in these parts of their finances equals increase in stock over medium and long terms.
