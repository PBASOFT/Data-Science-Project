39,2021-05-21,investing,"Adobe came out on top and not surprisingly Exxon was bottom.

In the table below the 2nd column is the Total ESG Risk Score (from Sustainlytics) and the 3rd column is ""difference from peers"".

A low risk score is ""good"" and vice-versa; for the peer comparison a negative number means the company has a better ESG rating than other companies in its industry/sector and vice-versa.

Amazon stands out as particularly bad versus its peers whereas NVIDIA is doing particularly well.

Tesla for all its environmental credentials is down near the bottom, although the bottom 5 is dominated by pharma.

110,2021-05-21,investing,"Investment Thesis for Daily Journal (DJCO)

Introduction:  The Daily Journal is viewed by the general public as a dying newspaper business.  It is a dying newspaper business, but the Daily Journal has pivoted itself to a SaaS business, but is trading at a valuation far below most other publicly traded Saas businesses.  We will investigate why the Daily Journal is a worthwhile investment at its current valuation.

Management:  Normally, we’d begin by looking at the business, but management within the Daily Journal is incredibly strong, so this will be our beginning.  The Chairman of the Board in Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.  He bought the Daily Journal in 1977 for $2 million dollars and has been the Chairman ever since.  The lesser known name leading the Daily Journal is Gerald Salzman.  He joined the Daily Journal in 1986 as their President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer.  As such, there is likely no one else who knows the Daily Journal as well as Gerald Salzman.  As an added bonus to the quality of the two men leading the Daily Journal, their executive compensation is almost unheard of.  The Board of Directors receive a payment of either $5000 or $0.  Gerald Salzman, the CEO, receives a salary of $250,000.  These are acceptable salaries due to the large amount of insider ownership within the Daily Journal.

The Business:  The Daily Journal has three business segments, 1) The Daily Journal Newspaper, 2) Equity Investments, and 3) Journal Technologies.

---

The Daily Journal Newspaper is a series of mostly California based legal newspapers.  Their revenue comes from advertising from display advertising (i.e. traditional advertising found in most newspapers), classified advertising, trustee notice sale advertising, legal notice advertising, and circulation advertising.  The sad but unfortunate truth for investors is that this portion of their business is worth very little.  The good news, however, is that most investors outside of the Daily Journal are not interested in investing in a dying newspaper and thus has led to the undervaluation of the Daily Journal.

I won’t spend any more time on this segment except to say that the newspaper’s most successful year isemi-modern history was during 2008 due to an extreme uptick in the need for legal advertising relating to the foreclosure of many homes.  It is possible that if another recession strikes, the newspaper business of the Daily Journal could provide some financial cushion to keep the Daily Journal in strong health.

---

Equities have been a growing proportion of the Daily Journal’s intrinsic value.  Charlie Munger’s investing prowess that has benefited Berkshire is also at work within the Daily Journal.  We have insight into the Daily Journal’s American investments thanks to their most recent 13F filing, which was released within the last week.  At this time, the Daily Journal holds $197 million worth of American equities, mostly concentrated in financial services similarly to the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.  Another notable holding is a new and growing position in Alibaba.  

While it is not explicitly confirmed, there is a VERY strong evidence that the Daily Journal also holds a sizable position in BYD, a Hong Kong traded electric car manufacturer.  This would not appear in its 13F filings, so its size cannot be confirmed, however we can make an educated guess.  The exact value of his BYD investment is unknown, however it is assumed to be be roughly $140 million.  In the most recent filing, the Daily Journal notes that it sold $20 million of one of its positions to reinvest into another security.  The suspicion is that this was a shift from BYD to BABA.  As such, we will value the BYD position at $120, though in truth, it may be slightly higher as BYD traded at a fewer dollars higher of a valuation prior to the most recent filing.  Nonetheless, we will assume its value is $120 million.  This brings the Daily Journal’s equity portfolio to a value of $317 million.

The Daily Journal also has $27 million in cash according to their latest annual report and they hold some office buildings in Los Angeles and in Utah which THEY value at $16.5 million.  I emphasized that they value the building because, as I’ll discuss below, the company has some questionable accounting practices.  In the instance of the office buildings in Los Angeles as an example, they valued the buildings at $16.5 million roughly 20 years ago and that figure has never been adjusted.  The result is that they are likely undervaluing the true value of their real estate holdings.  If we increase the value of these holding to $30 million, which seems like a fair appraisal for their buildings based on current market rate, this results in a total equity and asset value of $374 million.

Their liabilities consist of ~$60 million in deferred capital gains (0% interest), a $29.5 million margin loan (3% interest), and a $1.5 million mortgage (4% interest).  The deferred capital gains will not be paid anytime soon as Charlie Munger likes to hold stocks and when he sells, typically he will move into another qualified investment.  The margin loan was used to acquire businesses to build the Saas business and is serviced by the dividends from the bank stocks in the equity portfolio.  The mortgage is self explanatory.  Total liabilities amount to $91 million

Before jumping into the last portion of the Daily Journal’s business segment, I want to note that the Daily Journal has a market cap of $414 million.  As such, to reach its market cap valuation, assuming no value is assigned to the legal newspaper business (it has a value, it’s just not a high value and in all honesty, I don’t know what a fair value is for that business), the Journal Technologies business only needs to be worth $131 million to come a fair market value at its current market cap valuation.

---

Journal Technologies is the hidden gem of the Daily Journal.  It is a legal Saas business being sold to municipalities via the RFP process.  It is a case management system built off of a central e-Suites product that is then configured to meet the client’s needs.

It has a unique business model that results in, once again, an undervaluation of the company.  After being awarded an RFP, the company will then define the scope of the product, establish servers on site, and install its product, and then configure it to the clients needs.  All of this work takes 4 to 8 years to complete and during this time, the municipality is not billed.  On a relevant note to the questionable accounting practices above, the Daily Journal does not report the forthcoming revenue on its financial statements, thus these contracts have not necessarily been taken into account to determine the Daily Journal’s current market valuation.

When its e-Suites product goes live, the Daily Journal will charge an implementation fee and subsequently bill a licensing fee for the next 10 years (with built in price adjustments to account for inflation).  Currently, Daily Journal has over $100 million in forthcoming revenue which, due to their billing practices, is a very high-margin revenue once billing starts.  These contracts are found in the USA, Australia, Canada, and Tasmania currently, though more may have been signed and not discovered.  Credit to Matthew Peterson for taking the time to search across the web looking for tenders awarded to the Daily Journal, as there is not a central repository to identify these contracts.

Moving forward, the assumption is that the Daily Journal will continue onboarding new jurisdictions, there will be an increase in licenses purchased for existing contracts after e-Suites launches, consulting fees for upgrades and modifications will increase, and other e-solutions will be integrated with e-Suites to increase revenue (such as e-payment for fines and tickets).

While the Journal Technologies already has $30-some million in revenue, this figure will increase with time.  Additionally, these municipalities will likely continue using the e-Suite services once they go live after the time and cost of configuration, meaning revenue that is on the books today is revenue that will be on the books likely after the 10 years of licensing has expired.  Presently, Journal Technologies is a $200-$300 million business based on the figures and assumptions above.  Under this assumption, the Daily Journal is valued somewhere between $483 million and $583 million, meaning it is currently undervalued by 17% to 41%.

---

There are a few risks that need to be mentioned.  One is liquidity.  The Daily Journal has a $400 million dollar market cap and is too small for many large financial institutions to monitor.  It also has a $300 share price which, while irrelevant to value, will scare away many newer retail investors who invest $20 to $50 at a time.  Beyond these two issues, the Daily Journal has quite a bit of insider ownership or is owned by firms with long-term visions, thus they are not willing to sell shares on a daily basis.  The result is that only about 5,000 shares are traded on a daily basis.  This means that if you need to liquidate your position in a pinch, you may have to sell below the market rate.

The other glaring issue is age.  Charlie Munger is 97 years old and Gerald Salzman is 80 years old.  Beyond not being at the forefront of technological innovation on a personal level (some may view this as an issue when running a Saas business, personally I am not concerned as there job is to manage the people driving the Saas business), their old age means that in the coming years, their leadership may cease to exist.  No clear succession plan has been identified (this was raised during their last annual meeting by a concerned shareholder).  As management is a key strength within this business, this could be reason for pause for prospective shareholders.

Lastly, there is the $16 billion elephant in the room.  Tyler Technologies is their key competitor.  There are other smaller competitors who offer more limited solutions, but Tyler Technologies is the real competition in this space.  While their products are more modern and (likely) have better and flashier features, this is not necessarily what wins in RFP processes.  Instead, the Daily Journal’s practice of not charging the client until launch is a much more appealing catch for prospective clients.  While I’m sure Tyler Technologies will be a fine company in the long-term, its hard to argue that their fundamentals are nearly as attractive as the fundamentals of the Daily Journal.  The Daily Journal is valued at 8x sales, has a P/B of under 2, and has a P/E of 3.5.  By comparison, Tyler Technologies has a P/B of 8, is valued at 14x sales, and has a P/E of 91.  Tyler Technologies would need to continue growing at a very rapid pace to be a strong value investment (note that Tyler Technologies is still rapidly growing, though this rapid growth is slowing).  By comparison, the Daily Journal, if it continues at its current growth, is already a great investment.  As most clients are onboarded, growth is increasing and it is my belief that this will be a phenomenal investment.

215,2021-05-21,investing,"PPE is becoming much more of a B2B industry, with businesses in need of face masks and other gear to keep operations running smoothly while restrictions are lifted for the general public. This is especially true in states like NY where restrictions are tighter than Miami. 

As the CDC loosens fask mask restrictions for vaccinated people, I’m seeing a ton of young people outside (maskless) in strict areas like NYC. The streets look like a Miami Spring Break - a whole gathering of young people in the streets in large numbers and no masks to be found. 

The big takeaway, however, is that masks are strictly enforced inside all establishments. Using restaurants as an example, customers must wear masks when they enter/exit and move around, but they are not required to wear masks when they eat. Most importantly, business employees MUST wear masks at all times, and will therefore go through masks at a much quicker pace. The business itself will have to provide PPE for their employees, leading me to conclude the future of COVID era PPE is B2B (in the US / EU and countries with access to vaccinations). 

What company is best situated to provide business with direct PPE supply? OPTEC International (OPTI) acquired WeShield - a B2B PPE supplier, with clients from Old Navy to Carl’s Jr. What led me to OPTEC and WeShield however, is an [article ](https://www.bkreader.com/2021/04/14/nyc-restaurants-gifted-free-ppe-through-new-partnership/)I found about their PPE donations to NYC restaurants through a partnership with the NYC Hospitality Alliance. It turns out the WeShield is run by fellow restaurant owners turned medical suppliers. In the article, a WeShield spokesperson said that the PPE cost of a restaurant is about $5-10 per employee, per day. 

The article also acknowledged that alleviating PPE costs for independent restaurants is what sparked their donation campaign. But without donations, $5-10 per employee per day really adds up and leaves us with a still emerging market of PPE buyers. Not just restaurants but all brick and mortar businesses are new customers in a space that was mostly used by healthcare organizations.

It will be interesting to see how the divide for public vs commercial PPE restrictions grows and which sectors maintain their status as large quantity PPE purchasers. For now, restaurants and retail locations have no plans on changing their PPE policies which leaves a niche market for suppliers like OPTEC.",nhv1rp,[],0

Disclosure I do not own any shares. 

I came across LOTZ in a stock screener as I had set a price target of $5 and noticed it got close to it.  To keep with the discipline of doing more research upon researching the 1st price target I dug deeper and did the following model.  

Summary
Carlotz is really a lead-gen tech business to help rental fleets and consumers sell directly to retail  vs. going through the auction process.  They eliminate the extra step and fees that is entailed in auction houses.  The company also allows consumers to sell their cars to other consumers with Carlotz being the ""broker"" that makes the process easy for both parties. 
The revenues are: flat fee from buyer, fee from seller (used to inspect, clean car and take pics), financing and insurance upsells and lease income.  

However, the company reports the total car sale as the revenue which is a bit funky but legal.  This is why the GROSS margins are 10% to 12%, if the Gross Margins were the ""revenues"" the company would only show a revenue of $35 million for 2021 vs. $350 million, kinda hard to sell a SPAC at a $1.4 billion valuation when the revenues are $35 but with eventual ""80% EBITDA margins"". 

I ran a 10 year model and do believe the company can become profitable by 2023 unless they keep expanding more aggressively than modeled but by 2024 they can grow organically using cash flow.  

I think the stock is a buy at $4 since at this price we have some downside protection of the cash on the balance sheet of around $2 and at that price you are only paying a 1x enterprise value to multiple multiple which is on the low side compared to historical of Carvana, KAR and others. 

Would I want to own this business forever?  No,  but I think it can go from $4 to $10 to $15 pretty quickly if the GROSS margins go to 13% to 15% as they originally projected in their investor presentation, however in my 10 year model I do not see 15% margins until 2030z Management has missed guidance on revenues for 2021 and margins and the street doubts they can meet their numbers for this year.  This is the risk and why I think it may trade lower in the short-term.  

2021 rev 330mm and 1x ev would be $4 and 2x ev is $8

2022 rev is 850mm and 1x ev is $8 and 2x would be $16

2023 rev would be $1.4 billion and 1x ev would be $12 and at 2x ev would be $24

The execution risk is will they be able to meet these revenue targets and go from the current 10% gross margins to the 13% they said they would be able to do on the Octoeber 2020 investor deck. 

It could eventually become a takeover target as we have now 5 to 10 companies in this space and companies are always looking for growth. 

Anyway interested to hear your thoughts on this. I can definitely go more granular into the business model but for simplicity sake kept it short.

Looking forward to your comments!",nhvsxl,[],0

408,2021-05-21,investing,"Started trading options January. Read that entire thetagang wiki. Became obsessed and watched maybe 80 videos explaining the math. So please correct my thinking / rationale. 

I have a core position that I will never sell until 60 (+30 years from now). Consists of : AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, VTI, ARKK, ARKG, ARKF. Keep adding on 5% dips (except Arks). 
_______
Next: I have a few short positions. ARKK, ARKF and ARKG. More shares of the short than long because I am bearish in the short term and want to capitalize on my prediction. Once they dip some more, I will cover and reinvest all that profit back into my longs because I am bullish long term. 
_____
Options:

I have been using margin to sell weekly cash covered puts on TSLA for the past 6 weeks and have been collecting $250 a week. IV is close to 100% on the strikes so technically I’m IV-gang, but actually timevalue is high enough for the volatility of TSLA. Planning on continuing doing this. 

Then besides TSLA if there are fundamentally strong stocks that dipped 3-4 %, I like to sell weekly CSPs on those as well. So far it’s been AAPL, QQQ, SPY, MSFT. 

Total profit averaged each of the last 6 weeks from these is $300. Which to me is fantastic. 

Then I use this money to reinvest into my core - whoever/whenever dips. 

____

Conclusion / Strategy:

Core is sold when I retire. When core corrects, I buy more. Whenever the next black swan market crash occurs, core stays untouched. Don’t need the money and don’t care for short term tax. (Unless ofc my thesis in the fundamental of the stock changes, then I will plan to exit positions). 

Shorts/ Hedges: When any of my core positions start entering bubble-popping territory or are otherwise becoming overvalued, core stays untouched, but I will open small positions to short those core securities, and/or write calls andor buy puts. I hate buying puts but whatever makes most sense in that scenario. Once I’ve accumulated a “decent” amount, and I am no longer bearish, I close and reinvest back into the core. 

Options: I want to keep doing this every fuckin week man. $300 a week or even $200 a week is amazing money. That’s almost your entire food bill for a month. I invest typically 50% of each paycheck. And now I get to add more capital from these puts. And best of all, it’s mostly stress-free because I do choose strikes I am COMFORTABLE owning. I do need to migrate towards other stocks though besides blue chip tech.

Random thoughts:

-/ not trying to sound naive / nonchalant that it’s fully risk free. But then again I’m not chasing $10 premiums. I’m targeting the $2-$3 range. 

-/ sometimes when the premium is crappy , I’ll extend TDE but then exit early once I reach profit goal. And then I can sell more. 

-/ someone surely is going to ask why I’m selling naked puts on margin.  It’s naked because the cash is in the bank. It’s margin because I can spend more. I understand the risks and I have capital in the bank and I appreciate your thoughtful concerns :)

From the beginning, Norwegian politicians made it important that the inhabitants benefit from the wealth of raw materials: not only through sovereignty over mineral resources, but also through jobs.  The oil industry paid really well and pulled the wages of other industries with it.  In the medium term, this meant that inflation rose.

With the first oil price shock, the demand for Norwegian crude oil also fell.  Economic growth collapsed.  At the same time, the amount of foreign currency debt rose.

Norwegian politicians stuck to their long-term perspective.  They no longer wanted to make the Norwegian economy so dependent on oil and they also wanted to avoid the high export surpluses that had been common up until then, because that affected exchange rates and inflation.  That is why they came up with the idea of ​​completely investing the excess payments from oil exports abroad.  Quasi: Oil leaves the country, but the money received for it does not enter the Norwegian economic cycle.

The so-called oil fund came into being in the mid-1990s.  In this state-managed investment fund, the income from Norway's crude oil and natural gas sales is invested, all of the income, not just part of it.  The oil fund invests worldwide, long-term and according to ethical principles.  His goal is to provide for the financial future of all Norwegian residents if the income from oil and gas no longer flows at some point.

While private investors often act from the gut, the oil fund has clear rules and guidelines.  His goal is to invest the money optimally in the long term from a risk-return perspective.  Because the fund is responsible for the financial future of many generations to come.  Anyone can view the investments and results of the oil fund on the Internet at any time.  So there is great transparency.

The Norwegian Oil Fund is a low-risk, profitable investment in the future and can therefore serve as a role model for private investors.

Since 1998 the oil fund has grown to the equivalent of over one trillion euros.  This corresponds to a value of around 190,000 euros per inhabitant.

It's all about the right mix:

Since 1998, the oil fund has achieved an average gross return of a good six percent per year before costs, inflation and taxes.  The income fluctuates depending on the stock market situation: In some years there is even a minus, in others double-digit returns are recorded.  The fund invests very successfully in the long term.  But how exactly does it work?

The steady returns are possible because the oil fund diversifies its investments across different asset classes and across different industries and regions.

The three asset classes in which the oil fund invests are stocks, bonds and real estate.  Stocks fluctuate more than bonds, so they are riskier.  In return, they generate better returns.  Since the oil fund thinks long-term, it overweight equities, currently at around 70 percent.  Real estate is only a small addition.  The rest goes into bonds.  According to modern portfolio theory, those responsible expect the best risk-return ratio from this.  The proportion of stocks in relation to bonds and real estate is regularly checked and adjusted to the target - also known as rebalancing.

For equity investments, the oil fund is based on the FTSE Global All Cap.  This is a stock index that contains around 8,000 stocks from large, medium and small companies around the world.  However, the oil fund deviates somewhat: European stocks, for example, are overweight and US stocks are underweight.  In addition to individual regions, individual industries can also be overweighted or underweighted.  There is also a black list of companies that are not invested in for ethical reasons.  These include, for example, energy suppliers such as Tata Power, companies that partially or exclusively manufacture armaments such as Lockheed Martin, Honeywell International, Airbus, Boeing, or tobacco companies.

When it comes to bond investments, the oil fund has so far invested seventy percent in government bonds and thirty percent in corporate bonds.  However, since a company's stocks and bonds are often closely linked, it was recently decided to only invest in government bonds.

The Norwegian oil fund is therefore based on an optimized mix of asset classes: around two thirds of it consists of stocks, one third of bonds, and some real estate is also mixed in.

The compound interest effect increases the fund's return.  The longer the investment horizon, the more it exploits its advantages.  In the case of the oil fund, income from interest and dividends is now higher than the new deposits.

A look at the oil fund's portfolio:

You've just heard that the oil fund invests in stocks, bonds and real estate.

Let's start with the equity investments.  At the end of 2019, around 71 percent of the fund's assets were invested in stocks.  The focus is on North America, followed by Europe.  Africa brings up the rear with less than one percent.

The focus of equity investments is therefore on large, developed economies.  But stocks from less developed emerging countries, the so-called emerging markets, are also included.  The equity quota here is 11 percent, because the emerging markets promise higher returns in the long term than the established countries, but the risk is also higher.  Smaller companies are also overweighted because, similar to emerging market stocks, they generate more returns on average.

At the end of 2019, around 26 percent of the fund's assets were invested in bonds.  A little more than half of them were government bonds.  Similar to stocks, bonds focus on North America and Europe.  But other countries and currencies are also mixed in, for example bonds in Japanese yen, Mexican peso or Brazilian real have been taken out.  The share of emerging markets is nine percent.

The remaining 43 percent are currently corporate bonds and covered bonds such as Pfandbriefe or similarly secured bonds.  However, as I said, the portfolio of corporate bonds is to be reduced in the future in favor of government bonds.

The creditworthiness, i.e. the creditworthiness of the bond debtors, is consistently high: only two percent of the bonds fall into the speculative area.

The third asset class that the oil fund invests in is real estate.  At the end of 2019, the volume invested in real estate was just under three percent.  Here the fund concentrates on office, logistics and retail properties in top cities such as New York, London, Paris and Munich.

The five principles of the Norwegian investment strategy:

The fund managers of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund have not come up with a magic formula, but instead follow a series of investment guidelines, guidelines and rules.  We have put together for you the five most important principles of the Norwegian investment strategy.

First, there is the principle of passivity: invest passively and close to the index, which saves time and money.  The less fees you pay, the more income is left for you.

Second, there is diversification: the more you spread your wealth across different asset classes, the lower your risk of loss.  So take some time at the beginning to plan your strategy.  With the right mix of stocks, bonds and possibly real estate, choose an investment mix that suits your available assets and risk appetite.  Diversify within these asset classes according to geographic aspects.  Invest in both developed and developing countries, and by company size.  Overweight both emerging market stocks and smaller company stocks.  This way you can take advantage of opportunities and at the same time distribute your risk better.  About once a year you should restore your target quotas, i.e. rebalance.

Thirdly, we have the long-term investment horizon: Those who invest long-term can take more risks and thus generate a higher return.  Even if you are already retired, you should keep an equity stake.  Buy and hold, that is, buy and leave it alone, is more effective than trying to constantly chase after new trends.

Fourth, you should pay attention to consistency: what oil is to Norway, is your labor to you.  Invest a fixed amount every month, depending on your income, not the market situation.  If you earn more, increase your standing order.  This is also a better way of offsetting inflation.

And fifth, ethics also count: Pay attention to ethically correct, sustainable investments.  Violations of human rights, heavy pollution, arms manufacture, tobacco products or serious corruption are taboo for the oil fund.  For your private consumption, you can go a step further and only buy from companies that manufacture their goods ethically.

In short: invest long-term, regularly, sustainably, also diversified and index-based, and overweight shares of small companies and emerging markets as a return boost.

Build your personal future fund: The three levers for building private wealth

Now that we have taken a close look at the Norwegian oil fund, let's take a very practical look at how you as a private investor can implement the Norwegian strategy.  We take care of the three sub-areas stocks, bonds and real estate in turn.  But first, a few basic ideas about investing.

As already mentioned, there will be around 190,000 euros in the fund for every Norwegian in 2021.  If you want to save such a sum, there are various adjusting screws.

First of all, there is your investment horizon.  Following the Norwegian model, it should be an investment period of at least ten to fifteen years.  Even if you are about to retire, that doesn't mean that you need your money in one fell swoop.  You can pay out a monthly amount from your future fund instead of saving it further, a kind of private supplementary pension.

The second adjustment screw is your monthly savings rate.  How Much Money Can You Save?  Can you reduce fixed costs, do without what is superfluous or consume more consciously in order to invest this money in your future fund?  Do you already have securities or reserves in a call money or savings account?  You can also invest this money in your future fund.  If you earn more, you should increase the savings rate, at least by the rate of inflation.  Conversely, if you become unemployed, for example, you can lower your savings rate.

The third adjustment screw, the return, can only be influenced indirectly, namely through your asset class mix.  In addition to your personal perception of risk, it also depends on your investment horizon.  As a rule of thumb, subtract your age from 100, the sum corresponds to the share quota.  While as a thirty-year-old you invest seventy percent of your money in stocks, as a seventy-year-old you lower your risk with an equity ratio of thirty percent.  Of course, this also reduces the return.

The result, your saved wealth, results from the interaction of these three levers: investment horizon, monthly savings rate and return.

If you want to reach a certain amount, then it is important to start as early as possible.  This is also due to the compound interest effect.  The higher your return and the longer your investment horizon, the less you have to invest monthly.


Build your personal future fund: bonds

Now let's get into the construction kit of your personal future fund.  Our first pillar is bonds.  What can we learn from the Norwegians here?

Although the oil fund also invests worldwide in bonds, we limit ourselves to the most important currencies.  Because of their lower yield, currency fluctuations have a greater impact on bonds.  However, this is not a problem insofar as countries outside the eurozone also issue bonds in euros.

The prices of bonds also fluctuate, depending on the creditworthiness of the issuer, the remaining term and the interest rate level.  The oil fund tries to minimize this risk by only investing in government bonds with a maximum term of ten years.

An ETF savings plan is particularly useful if you are not yet very familiar with the capital market or if you cannot invest a lot of money.  ETFs, short for Exchange Traded Funds, are so-called index funds.  They replicate an index one to one;  this passive structure lowers costs, which in turn increases your return on investment.  You will remember: The oil fund also invests in line with the index.

For a bond quota similar to the Norwegian model, you should have a single ETF with a remaining term of no more than ten years that invests in government bonds that are denominated in euros.  You can find corresponding products on the website justetf.com.  For example the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays 7-10 Year Euro Government Bond ETF (ISIN IE00BYSZ5Z42).  Of course, you can also take ETFs with other maturities or other country focuses outside the euro zone.  Take a close look at the countries and maturities in which the ETF invests.  You can find this information, for example, on finance portals or on the websites of the providers.  The names alone do not always allow conclusions to be drawn about the content.

When it comes to sustainability, bond ETFs don't have much to offer at the moment.  So far there are only a few so-called green bonds.  You could, for example, buy a German government bond directly or a single green bond.  Rebalancing, i.e. aligning with your originally planned mix of assets, is usually easier with ETFs.

For your first fund pillar, the following applies: Government bonds that are denominated in euros and can be spread around the world contribute to stability.

So if you like it simple, you can tick off the bond issue with a single ETF.  It's more complicated with stocks.  For this, the topic of sustainability comes into play more strongly.

Build your personal future fund: stocks

So what can we learn from the Norwegians about stocks?  ETFs are also recommended here, with a maximum of twelve different ones.  The amounts per ETF should not be too small, otherwise this can increase the transaction costs.

The Norwegian Oil Fund invests worldwide, and that is what you should aim for for your equity exposure.  The following breakdown is recommended: 80 percent of industrialized market shares, 80 percent of which in large caps and 20 percent in small caps.  The 80 percent share of industrialized countries is distributed geographically as follows: 44 percent in North America, 44 percent in Europe and 12 percent in Asia and Oceania.  The remaining 20 percent of the equity stake is invested in emerging markets.  However, no further distinction is made here according to company size or region, as the diversification would otherwise be too confusing.

Are you still looking through  With a 70 percent equity component, this means, for example: 28 percent shares large caps North America, 28 percent shares large caps Europe, 8 percent shares large caps Asia and Oceania, 7 percent shares small caps North America, 7 percent shares small caps Europe, 2 percent shares  Small caps Asia and Oceania, 20 percent equities in emerging markets.  With a different share of shares, you can calculate the odds yourself using the above specifications.

For equity ETFs, you should prefer replicating over synthetic ones.  Replicating ETFs actually buy the share packages that are available in the fund, weighted according to the index, while synthetic ETFs artificially replicate the index via swap transactions.

On justetf.com you can filter funds by country, company size and all sorts of other criteria in order to replicate your future fund based on the Norwegian model.  You are of course flexible with the number of ETFs, but with seven you can map the Norwegian portfolio quite well.  If you are still at the very beginning of your future fund, you can first approach the optimal composition with fewer ETFs.  For industrialized countries, for example, you could use the UBS MSCI World SRI (ISIN LU0629459743) and for emerging markets the iShares MSCI EM SRI (ISIN IE00BYVJRP78).

In the two ETFs mentioned, ethical and moral aspects are taken into account, as you can usually see from the abbreviations SRI for socially responsible investment or ESG for environmental social governance.  Sometimes the providers work with negative lists, sometimes they pursue a best-in-class approach.  The latter means that they only invest in the most exemplary companies in an industry, such as the oil giant Total.  The approaches are not yet perfect, but they are still an important step towards sustainable investing.

Globally diversified stocks should make up the main part of your future fund; their higher returns mean that currency fluctuations are less significant in the long term.

We have now ticked off the two most important asset classes, stocks and bonds.  The question of adding real estate remains.

Build your personal future fund: real estate

The third pillar makes it a little more difficult for us.  That is why we do not start with the question of how, but start much more fundamentally with the question: real estate, yes or no?

Why?  Well, the oil fund invests a maximum of seven percent of its assets in directly held commercial real estate in prime locations.  As a private investor, you can forget that.  Even if you want to implement the real estate quota in the form of owner-occupied residential property, you would have to be a multiple millionaire to catch up with the oil fund.

Basically, you should clarify for yourself whether you want to have a property you use yourself or not.  If your answer is yes, forget about the strategic real estate quota.  Just be aware that the money you put into a property cannot be invested in your future fund at the same time.  Think not only of possible increases in the value of your property, but also of ancillary purchase costs, maintenance costs and mortgage interest.  You will only know afterwards what you will use to generate a better return, the property or your future fund.

Alternatively, you can invest smaller amounts in real estate using real estate ETFs or REITs.  The latter is short for Real Estate Investment Trust, which are public companies that earn their money with real estate.  The specialty of REITs is that they distribute a large part of their profits.  As with other investments, you should reinvest this income in order to use the compound interest effect for you.  An example of a real estate ETF with a focus on “industrialized countries” is the iShares Developed Markets Property Yield ETF (ISIN IE00B1FZS350).

To put it in a nutshell: real estate is immobile.  Therefore, think carefully about whether and in what form real estate should be part of your future fund.

Okay, did you understand?  Then get started: Open an online account, set up a savings plan that corresponds to your desired risk-return mix, and make sure to rebalance at least once a year.  Then you too can get rich like Norway.


Too long, didn’t read:

Let's sum it up again: The Norwegian Oil Fund is investing its money in the future.  He only uses stocks, bonds and, to a small extent, real estate.  Its success is based on an optimal risk-return mix, low costs, a long-term perspective and the consideration of sustainability.  The fund is completely transparent: both its strategy and its individual investments can be viewed on the Internet.

This is exactly what you can take advantage of as a private investor.  In order to put together your personal future fund based on the Norwegian model, first decide on the mix of assets that is right for you.  Then find suitable ETFs and set up a monthly savings plan.  With a long-term investment horizon and annual rebalancing, your returns should ultimately be as successful as Norway’s oil.",ni2sjd,[],0

Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities Delinquency(CMBS)
----------------------

The 2008 crash was caused by Residential MBS default rate of 8%. While currently the overall 60+ day delinquency (behind in payments) rate is an average of ~4%, Hotels are ~16%, Malls are ~16%,  and retail space is ~9%.This poses a risk to destabilizing banks who may have to take a hit on the balance sheet as they try and recoup losses in settlement.

Record Levels of Margin
--------------

Those investing in the stock market are currently running record levels of margin (847 billion) compared to the more moderate levels in years past (500b to 600b). This represents increase risk to destabilizing banks in the event that they are not able to recover the loans during a liquidation event. Examples of similar events affecting banks this year are Archegos and Greensill.

Residential Forbearance Programs Ending
---------------------

Millions of evictions could be coming with the end of forbearance protections and the end of supplemental unemployment provisions. See source link. This could literally go exactly like 2008 again, destabilizing banks, etc etc.

Overnight Reverse Repo Deposits Increasing
---------------

There might be too much cash in the market, or there might be too much leverage and rehypothecation of treasury bills as collateral for margin. Depending on the reasons, creates some negative scenarios. Honestly this isn’t one I fully understand myself, but I’m marking it down as a potential risk. I’ve included a video that attempts to explain it.

Foreign Markets
------------

The 2008 crisis started in the US, but affected the world. It’s reasonable that an event in another market could be the straw that broke the US’s back. The EU sees similar economic risks that I’ve already raised. Service oriented countries (tourism, retail) are likely at higher risk of businesses becoming insolvent. There was a downtick in 2020 due to Covid slowing courts but it is likely to increase an unforeseeable amount in the future. Easing of economic support by the central bank could exacerbate this, causing loss of jobs and defaulting on the ever increasing debt of residential mortgages (apparently the housing prices are ballooning everywhere). Margin levels and the stock market as a bubble were inferred.
