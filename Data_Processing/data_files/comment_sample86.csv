Right now, the world has moved from buying US bonds to investing in US debt and equity markets.  When those markets begin failing, people will move out of them much quicker than they would the US bond market (and their next move won't be to put their preserved capital into bonds).

That's where the real danger is.

The harsh reality is that there are debt and equity markets all around the entire world. There are mirror companies for pretty much every US economic undertaking.

Burry was right and went hard on the y2k .com bubble.

Burry was right in 2008 and went hard, super yolo.

Burry is a legitimate Autist (though, Musk is too LUL)

Burry was the original GME Long...the dude exited before others because he had to take profit for his fund.  With the large amount of money he had invested, he knew a downturn could be swift and he could have a hard time exiting.  Investing your own money is different than investing other people's money....he still made a 5X play.

Burry is a genius and a truth-speaker.  

Between the two, I would never bet against Burry.  Unlike the other ""doom sayers"" the guy is right when he points something out, and he isn't just a doom and gloomer..he goes long in good companies.",gyi393b,t3_nenzge,[],1

AMC sells popcorn and shit movies. LOTS of them. And MRVI sells remedies included in Covid vaccines. LOTS of them.  In fact they raised revenue guidance by a hundred million dollars.  


AMC has customers that come, go and maybe they buy popcorn and a soda. MRVI has Pfizer as a customer with two years or so worth of contracted commitments for BILLIONS of doses of vaccines.  


AMC sells at what, hundreds PE or they lose money. MRVI has revenue growth of 191% PLUS actual earnings of $1.12 per share projected for this year. That one is a very close comp.  


AMC has HUGE short interest because lots of people know, um, I mean think it's shit and they are getting CRUSHED for it. Run AMC. run.  But with MRVI, nobody would dare short that thing for reasons stated.  


In closing, both companies are nearly identical but for a few minor differences. Both are GREAT investments. Both go up almost every day. So they're like, TWINS.

There's a pretty famous case of a sergeant in Iraq evacuating a crowded cafe because he got a weird vibe from one of the dudes in there. They found IEDs the guy had planted. The sergeant couldn't point to any single thing about the guy or any action he had taken that tipped him off. He just felt like something bad was about to happen. Stories of squad leaders that seemed to have a sixth sense of ambushes or traps have been around in the military since forever but in the US especially from Vietnam. The military wants to know if there's real scientific legitimacy to the claims.

The rational argument for stories like that is that the person subconsciously noticed minute clues in behavior, body language, or changes in the environment that tipped off the conscious brain to potential danger. The slightly less rational explanation is that the humans, or at least some of them, have an as yet unquantified sixth sense. Call it ""spidey sense"", intuition, or pre-cognition. The military is going to spend your tax dollars finding out, and if it's the second one they'll spend more trying to figure out if it's something they can train into their soldiers.

I already rode the GME train, I did fine. My GME position was established last year and closed earlier this year. As entertaining as it is seeing hordes of gamblers constantly feed their addiction and provide each other with confirmation bias, I hit my profit target and exited. 

I entered a position with UWMC because of technicals combined with the extremely high short interest. Just because you haven’t heard of a stock doesn’t mean it doesn’t have potential or interest from other people. The universe is larger than two stocks. If you dedicate your trading existence to simply following what gambling addict claim to be doing on Reddit, you deserve the result. 

While true short squeezes are rare, there can be substantial upward pressure from very high short interest. It can provide opportunity if the entry point is low enough and the short interest is high enough. In the past 5 days, UWMC has gained over 20%, for example. And that’s without really much covering by the shorts. Why? Look at their ER and the analysis with it. Not OP’s post here, but legitimate analysis. Plus, it pays a dividend very soon. 

TLDR; the company is in the process of buying back substantial shares of stock, the ER was very good, short sellers have likely oversold their positions, the cost to borrow shares (if you can find them) is astronomical, and I like money. I use that money to make more money by finding opportunities. If you keep expecting the same play on the same stock to just keep repeating itself (and aren’t actually operating off a legitimate technical basis or algorithm-driven trading), then hard lessons will be learned. There is a substantial difference between a trader and a gambler constantly yoloing or someone who has whatever pittance they call a yolo tied up on a meme stock for months on end instead of actually making that money do work for you.",gyi5pda,t1_gyi306b,['GME'],1

TSLA rocketed like nothing else. But that would mean a ""big short""-esque short position would bu(r)ry him financially. So, this could be alleged his positions are shorter than what people assume.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

There wouldn’t be Tesla vehicles without it, but also allows them to better compete in the solar space, because their backup tech is top notch. As battery technology continues to improve, the Tesla is poised to make an absolute killing in the commercial solar + storage space, which could ultimately make that side of the business more profitable than their vehicle division.

4246,2021-05-17,wallstreetbets,"I mean it makes sense that the same Curved Brain Hedgies that Shorted GME shorted AMC and UWMC. Or at least that there is a ton of spillover/exposure between the three. So with all three pushing in the right direction... Should we not be seeing a collapse of all three? One would think that once the covering begins on AMC- The covering at GME and UWMC isn't far behind. (Or Vice Versa). A domino effect in full. Certainly can't be smooth sailings over in Short Town. $UWMC Value guys like me are full Ape with you these days.  
  
Including my earlier post on UWMC- For some reason WSB seems to be taking it down? Unsure what Guideline I'm violating but perhaps it sticks better here.  
  
Full Disclosure- I own a Mortgage Brokerage. My Office is all long UWMC.  
  
I am the opposite of most of you Apes. I am a Value Investor. Yes- They still make me. A damn dinosaur lurking amongst you apes. I have never been a big proponent of these ""Squeeze"" plays. Gamestop and AMC and RKT felt a bit like musical chairs. If the Music Stops I have Zero Interest in a $150 Gamestop Share. Or a $40 RKT. I can't imagine many rational investors thinking OH BOY! I'll just Hodl this to the Grave with GME. That seems full Autist. Its a squeeze play through and through.  
  
On the other hand I buy $UWMC because I know it as the market leader in my industry. Criminally undervalued at the moment. The CEO is a mad man. Wakes up at an ungodly hour and works well into the Evening. I know because the bastard has called me at 5PM Pacific after emailing me at 3AM Pacific the night before. (And I'm not a huge account). Mat Outworks everyone. Always has. Why?  
Mat has a Big Ass chip on his shoulder. Not wired like me. I'm a happy go lucky dude. Not ultra competitive. Google Image Mat Ishbia and then figure out how he Walked onto Michigan State to play for Championship caliber Tom Izzo. Ass Kiss and Hustle. Pure Salesman through and through. From relatively humble beginnings Ishbia now has Billions. In Detroit. Guy could choose to never work another day in his life and still live out all of your fantasies each and every day. Full on Rat Race with the Stripper and the Hot Tub. But he doesn't. He keeps Grinding. He keeps going. Why? Because he wants to be #1 in the mortgage space. That's his goal. Always has been. I'm wagering (With near all of my families worth) that he gets there.  
  
I liked $UWMC at $13. I liked it more at $9. I went ""All in"" when it fell into the 7's. Other Coworkers (Lucky Apes) went all in mid 6's. Based on where they stand right now (#2 Mortgage company in the world making cash hand over fist) it pencils out. If you are betting they are #1 within 4 years (Which I AM) it Certainly pencils out. So that is to say that today at $8.25 its still very much a bargain and a long term hold in my book. Its not Ultra Sexy. Its just a Cash Cow. I could sell this to Aunt Dorothy in her Retirement Account with the utmost of ease of Mind. Dorothy- Relax and catch a Dividend. This Stock Fucks.  
  
Which brings me the the whole Squeeze thing. I've read a few of the DD's on this and from what I can see- You apes might be right. There are only so many Shares outstanding and apparently the Hedgies decided to fuck with $UWMC because it was a SPAC. (Yes as a value guy I hate most Spacs). But they fucked up on this one. Only reason they went SPAC was liquidity issues during Covid. Ishbia was sick and tired of not having the Funds to fight Rocket. Spac was the fastest avenue to get the Cash.  
  
So here we are. We have a value play that attracts Value guys like me. But it also pops up as a possible Squeeze play. In my book I see this as the clear best Squeeze to someone jumping in now because there is no musical Chair game. You get $UWMC at $9? $10? $12? $15? $20? Great. Enjoy it. The company pencils out to earn enough cash to substantiate those valuations. $UWMC is the play that is in my opinion extremely safe yet also has the potential to really pay off for your Wife's Cabana boy.  
  
Oh- And all you $RKT guys out there. I'm sorry to burst the bubble there. Stop. Listen to the $RKT earnings call. Listen to $UWMC. then come back to talk. Not only did $RKT miss on Q1 but they forecasted a worse Q2 and then doubled down by adding- Hey- From here on out we are going to compare future quarters to 2019. 2020 is an unfair comparison/benchmark because it was a ""Outlier"" in the industry. $UWMC took the opposite approach. Ishbia said Q2 would surpass Q1 2021. Ishbia then went on to say he expected 2021 to EXCEED 2020. I mean cmon. $RKT says we aren't even going to compare with our last year of Corporate earnings. $UWMC said we are going to beat last year. Rocket was cute as a Squeeze (I mean its a damn RKT) but don't try to sell me $RKT as a smart long term hold.  
  
I suppose there is a reason all of you Apes write this is not Financial Advice so here I am- This is not Financial Advice. I have no Financial chops. Just a smooth brained Mortgage Broker betting on the winner in his Industry. Its UWM. By alot.

They have the world's largest library of on-the road driving computer vision data, and that's stuff has trained their AI models. They are years ahead of the curve. No one else comes close. Should they license it to a traditional car manufacturer, that'll change the car manufacturing game forever. 

And then they have the largest charging station network. Again, no else comes close. They could license that, as well.

If you look at Tesla as a car company, yeah, it's massively overpriced. 

But if you look at Tesla like an Uber..then it's a whole other ballgame. Like Uber, there are lots of new players competing ride-sharing/food delivery services, but Uber has so much leverage as the incumbent, first mover at scale, that's it's unreal and essentially they have distribution monopoly, or very close. 

Tesla is similarly sitting on assets that could do the same play on software and it's amazing to me he hasn't sold out to anyone yet. 

Basically Tesla has so many exist strategies if traditional car manufacturers take aim at their market share, that it makes Tesla a very slippery, very competitive, software company like no other.

Spoiler alert.  The stock has always been a piece of shit.   March of 2019 it was trading in the $7-$8 range.  For the apes that can't math, it was a shit stick a full fucking year before corona was a thing.   

Now that we are on the back side of the pandemic just keep in mind they've diluted the piss out of the stock, it has shit fundamentals, it was probably 2 years away from going under BEFORE corona, and it that wasn't enough, their popcorn sucked and my ass stuck to their fake leather seats.

Even with all that, there's a ton of idiapes like ""omg buy the dip! Stick it to the shorts!   Dude, SHORTS will ALWAY WIN on this one.   You buy the dip and they sell the peaks.   Rinse and repeat.  The shorts want you to keep buying those dips . .lol...

I was going to leave it in my saving account for emergencies when I noticed my interest rate was a whopping 0.5%! So I created a Robinhood account. I put $90 into AMC on Friday, and $20 into Tesla, apple, & amazon. I've made $16 bucks off the AMC and penny's on the rest. But with the excitement of over a 10% return over 1 weekend just killed the idea of keeping a savings account. I know I am new and that's not normal, but I'm having fun...

I know I'm not gonna get rich, especially only being able to add a few bucks a month to my robinhood account, but I want to keep enjoying myself and maximize my pitiful gains....

So, short term, should I dump everything I have just into AMC? Diversify into GME? Or play the long game with TSLA?

Balances game and chat a bit more but I'm still looking for more improvements. Especially with footstep increase/comm decrease.

Also valorant footsteps are low/lowmid bass frequency heavy so upping your low frequencies a tad may help with footsteps.

Make your own judgement here, but consider...

2) This is for positions held through 3/31/2021. That was 45 days ago. 
3)TSLA closed at roughly $670 on 3/31. It’s currently at $570 and Lo of $559. 
4) it’s entirely possible he could have closed his position and made a lot of money. He also could still have it. 
5) he has very consistently expressed his feelings about TSLA since last year. This isn’t really “new” or “news.”
6) before he deleted his Twitter a few months ago, he was REALLY comin in hot with the hyperinflation narrative and comparing it to Weimar, Germany. Could he be right, yes, could be. Is he probably going insane because no one expected the FED’s intervention efforts to play out like this? Possible. 

Point is, Burry is smart AF. His analysis is right from a technical numbers standpoint. But there are many other factors to consider as well.

If it's in the same tax year, you just do the wash sale math, and if you closed it out then you get whatever it is.

Say you buy at 10, sell at 8, and buy back at 6 within 30 days.

Instead of having a loss of 2, and a cost basis of 6, you instead have a loss of 0 and a cost basis of 8. 

If you then sold at 7 you have a loss of 1, instead of the loss of 2 and gain of 1 you were expecting. If you sold at 9 you'd have a gain of 1 instead of a loss of 2 and a gain of 3. 

If you didn't close out, then you don't get to claim that loss and that sucks if you were counting on it, but the difference carried forward in the cost basis adjustment so you'll get it later.

And if you sold in December and bought in January it's worse, but I can't remember why. I think it's basically the same as the didn't sell case. You lose the loss but get it in the adjusted cost basis going forward.",gyij9lx,t1_gyif5sa,[],0

*****
> Tesla historically racked up around $1.6 billion in regulatory energy credits, primarily zero emission vehicle credits, which helped Tesla report more than four consecutive quarters of profitability, qualifying Elon Musk&#039;s automaker for addition to the S&P 500 index.

> Tesla is currently delayed in producing and delivering its updated versions of its high-end sedan and SUV, the Model S and X. And it is delayed in commercial production of its custom-designed &quot;4680&quot; battery cells for use in forthcoming vehicles, including the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi.

> Correction: Michael Burry is long puts against 800,100 shares of Tesla, according to a filing with the SEC. An earlier version misstated the number of put contracts Burry purchased.

I have heard traders say that they got their position by just talking their way in after just skirting their way through college. Many don't do truly in depth further research. If a company says that it is making billions, find out where and why that is. If they claim they will double their profit, find out how and why. Half of what he had done to make so many great trades are the things that people skip over. It is even in the movie The Big Short, but most just see it as a throw away line. They discuss how he knew the market was going to fail and one of the characters says he actually read the documents followed by ""who actually reads those?"". 

He probably researches 100s of companies and that is the reason he makes so few trades. If you go for the ones where the BS is going to surface soon, you can ""YOLO"" it all on 2 or 3 trades a year and end up with massive gains.

At least according to this sub, squeezes can last hours, days, or weeks - I suspect as GME or AMC build past where they are now, FOMO will kick in again. Once a significant dip from the top happens (like 10%-15% or more) then fear will set in, and the price will settle back to valuation and/or however much the bagholders are hoping to sell at to get out of their dead position.

AMC and GME could go on forever at an inflated price, but more often then not they will leverage their high valuation for acquisitions and dilutions to fund expansion efforts until their true value equalizes. Or, the apes here will be satisfied and sell until the only people left are individuals, ETFs, and institutions wanting a piece of a unique business (brick-and-mortar/online gaming-focused store.)",gyinxfm,t1_gyimc5p,"['GME', 'AMC']",1
