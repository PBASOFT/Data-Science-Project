21,2021-05-23,StockMarket,"We have see now the correction in the speculative space and tech. Most of the big speculative picks are down around 30-50% from all time highs.

Now we are seeing the correction in the virtual coin exchange with those same kind of numbers (It looks like it might even get uglier).

What is the next sector to correct and lose all our money in if we are invested?

I don't want to be a doomsayer but I think there is a lot more going on then simply moving to ""value stocks"".

49,2021-05-23,StockMarket,"I started trading in January and made 14k from Jan-February. I put in 3k total so I had about 17k in my account. However that little pullback in February hit my stock pretty hard that I was all in on (i know, a stupid thing to do) and I lost 4k. This left me at 14k, and then I lost another thousand, and then I took out money to buy a PC, and then more to pay back some loans. This left me at 10k. I was playing with Doge going all in and selling for cents more, making $200 each time. I was doing good, then bitcoin crashed and caused all other cryptos to crash, and Doge did. This morning I made an instinct sell and sold all of my Doge for a loss of 4.7k. I have about 5.5k left and I don’t know if I should keep trading or step away and take my money out. I’m really stressing here I don’t know how to handle this, i’m only 19.",nje0ha,[],0
312,2021-05-23,StockMarket,"Full disclosure - made and deployed by myself. Censored the subreddit name because this isn't a ""status of that sub"" post, and wanted to share the results of something interesting I did that involves stocks.

&#x200B;

I built an algorithm that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across just the WallStreetBets sub (weighted by upvotes, etc.) -- rebalanced monthly. The strategy involves analyzing stocks and conducting sentiment analyses on their mentions to buy or sell. There's a healthy amount of $GME and $AMC, some $SPCE, some $NVDA, and 13 other stocks.

&#x200B;

Right now I'm up 44% YTD, compared to the SP500's 13%.

Some stats (and a picture of the returns):

&#x200B;

\- The strategy is \*\*backtested\*\* only to the beginning of 2020, but I'm working on it. It's got an \*\*annualized return of 26%\*\* (compared to 16% for the SP500)

&#x200B;

\- \*\*Max drawdown\*\* of -8.7% (thought this was pretty interesting - W\\\*B would be a very cool hedge for financial markets at large. Rode COVID like a wave)

&#x200B;

\- \*\*Sharpe Ratio\*\*: 2.22. Here's an \[investopedia link\]([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp)) for those of you that can read

&#x200B;

\- Profit-Loss ratio of 3.48.

&#x200B;

\- Avg win of 0.85%

&#x200B;

\- Avg loss of -0.24%. The fact that this number's absolute value is lower than average win is a good thing

&#x200B;

Anyways, invested around $60k in January myself, I'm at around $90k rn. Not one of my main investment vehicles, and maybe not the smartest investment, but I make myself feel better by telling myself it's smarter than Y\*LOing on puts.

I'm used to putting stop losses at under 2-4% for normal non volatile stocks in the stock market. I started investing in crypto a few months ago and don't know how to calculate where to put the sl, I've read 15% is fine, or calculate it with something related to the volatility, which I did not understand.

Could someone please tell me how do I calculate sl or tell me a website where they explain this, because I couldn't find a webpage where they explain it well.

Hey All,

No promotions, no names at all.  I joined over 200 Options Trading Discord Servers and have began tracking the trades of **9 different rooms**, each with **over 70% average win rate per week**.  
You can find in the Google Folder below.  
I'll soon update each sheet live for free, if enough people share it around. Will also update the exact minute they share the trades.  
I hope this helps

450,2021-05-23,StockMarket,"So I'm thinking it's going to be crypto news, when covid hit everything dropped, including gold. Gold is doing good and definitely not having big drops. If I had a dime outside of crypto to bet, I'd bet some huge regulation news is coming. I'd imagine true crypto investors that have been in for nearly a decade or longer are sick to their stomachs right now. The whole point of this is deregulation and allowing the small investor to make money, but it's now abundantly clear that the same whales manipulating the stock market are now taking part in crypto and destroying something that was awesome. Then regulations will come under the guise of ""protecting the little investor"" when it actually moves the goalposts insanely in the whale's favor. 
It's just really hard for me to fathom how every single coin simultaneously plummets. It let's me know very few people hold the majority of all coins and they're in every single coin, even the shit coins. Moving forward, we all need to write down goals and targets that we pull at least 50% profit if not 70%. At any moment the rug can be pulled out from under us, regardless if your coin choose is good or not. 

Idk about y'all but I've missed out on at least 25k this year by just holding and waiting for the big surge.. here's the secret though.. even if it has a big surge it still corrects and allows us to jump back in. 

And now I not only missed out on that 25k, but I'm back at square fucking one. Before I at least had 100-150% gains that were staying, so I kept telling myself, ""I don't need to pull any profits it will keep going up"".. I still believe that it will in the long run, but I'd love to have that 25k I missed by not pulling. I'd throw half into xrp and XLM right now and just not even think about it until I see crypto trending again 🤷‍♂️

Sorry I'm rambling, but I have nobody to talk to about this and I'm afraid of what I might do if someone even looks at me wrong, if I don't get this off my chest 😆😆😆😆",njka4i,[],0

Note I prefer higher time frames, like the monthly candles, because there is soo much noise on daily and weekly charts,

Of course the confidence in a bull era, above higher time frames important moving averages adds confidence smaller time frames will resolve upwards.

I said about the enclosed chart at the bottom that it ABSOLUTELY BLOWS MY MIND,

&#x200B;

*Processing img 548ooaq1ny071...*

 

Zooming in, friday 's bounce off bottom of formation, during 6x spike in volume. Nice try. This formation has proven rock solid over & over since March. Breaking it will take more than dumping 50,000,000 ounces in 5 minutes. Nowhere to go but up for now.

Because we see charts the way The Banks do.

2. Fed admits inflation may not be transitory

From fed : A number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and, if so, these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year.

Justput oil prices so you can expect CPI where :

3. Music stops for Silver and Gold alternatives :

China opens its borders for gold imports. ( supportive for silver action )

Here is the Chinese offical goverment stance for Gold and silver from the following article so obvious . This is the first time saw that kind of bullish news . especially important that this news from Chinese official goverment declaration

[https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1224071.shtml](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1224071.shtml)

Chinese Social media platform pointed out that some users call for switch to Gold which they said was more stable than crytpocurrencies 

Music stopped ! for gold and silver alternatives for cyrptocurrencies  .

Who remembers the feeling when you road trip to a NEW destination...  90 km feels an eternity, and that you'll never get there.  But once you arrive at destination, the travel doesn't feel as long anymore.  This is what you felt in a correction.  You have arrived. 

Still too complicated for many .

4. Big adds from SLV and PSLV this month the first after February almost 15 million ozz per month this is 2 % increase in total ETFS . Somebodies almost see the light

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h5i7gg6mny071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a0310b3b90029e9cf3152efae289c5293865baa

&#x200B;

 

5.USD index ( DXY) breaking ;

One of the drivers for the next strong move up in silver will be the USD index (DXY) breaking below the Feb '18 low of 88.15 and descending into its 3yr cycle low. It is currently on calendar day 84 of the current intermediate cycle. They usual run 160-280 calendar days.

6. Modeled Gold Price:

CPI inflation index is a poor historical tracker of the gold price. The pink dashed line below shows the cycle high price of $35/oz price from 1934 projected forward using CPI scaling. Clearly, M2 scaling with a mine-supply discount tracks the gold price much better.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rokba99qny071.png?width=3228&format=png&auto=webp&s=8266ba12aaeca17f9f9b6c0a7eada8e2fefc710c

 

Once this is all behind us, there should be a strong move up in gold into the summer. After that, I would expect the next big move in gold to be a push up to \~$3000 by mid-2022 .

7. Gold /silver Ratio :

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5wcx3jbsny071.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2500d8f5c1539c5a13d9eb9dc944fc11455a557

 

So silver will lead the metals and the gold/silver ratio, now at 67, will initially reach 30 like. The long term target is likely to be a lot lower, probably 15 or below. As talked before the expected Gold prices 3.000 usd in the mid of 2022 and with gold /silver ratio we can expect price range 150 -200 Usd /ozz which is x8 gain from actual 27.6 usd /ozz price .

Now our tickets :

1. Physical Silver bars coins , or other stuff just as an example : This is normally the best silver investment type if you can find with reasonable premiums .Nowadays the premiums are sky high due to reddit silver enhusiasm so for most late comers almost it is over . Spot at $27.65. Some internet sites selling eagles for $44.28. Either something big is coming and they know it or someone selling this to you is wearing a ski mask. Either way, not sure why you would buy this product at this price.

&#x200B;

2. PSLV Reaches $4 BILLION in Assets! 144,213,789 total ounces of Physical Silver  
53 million ounces of physical silver added in 2021 . Actually now only feasible alternative . Fully liquid and buy and sell in a second and also hedge yourself .

3. ZSİL ( swiss ) , or other European allocated ETFS .

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At least 10 /20 % silver add to your portfolios as hedges and don't miss out this once a time opportunity .

Lastly :

The fact that I'm seeing so few cheerleaders getting giddy about the upside in precious metals and miners is a welcome positive for further gains  in the weeks and months ahead imho.
