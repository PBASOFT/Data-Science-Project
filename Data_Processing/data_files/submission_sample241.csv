300,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"The cruise line industry has been nearly brought to extinction during the pandemic, but with the vaccines being distributed, cruise lines are making a major comeback. 
This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let’s go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there’s a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

Overall, I’m bullish and have over 30 call contracts expiring this July 🚀🚀🚀",nhdnzi,[],0
301,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"Everyone has shit on RKT over the past couple of weeks since forward guidance was down, but is choking on UWMC’s cock, despite the fact that industry and market headwinds will affect both equally. There is little difference in their lines of business at the moment, margins are similar, products are similar. There’s very little differentiation, he’ll they’re in the same city. UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special. 

Next week, either Jay Farner gets flashy (new dividend, massive auto rollout, something new) and starts publicly pushing back against Ishbia, or RKT continues downward. I think it’s 50/50 but looks ripe for anyone looking for a straddle yolo, with IV not as bad as it was before.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

320,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"So I went down the rabbit hole a while back after being a meme stock bear.  Mind blown. All I have to say is watch Wes Christian. I had been trading for a decade and you apes opened this world up to me.  

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

330,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

332,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options.

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity.

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions.

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.**

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

338,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

The potential is so large it's not a cherry anymore, but rather a pineapple on the cake 🍍🎂

I know, in the last week many talked about a possible future crash in the stock market, inflation and there is too much liquidity and bla bla bla. I am not here to say the next crash will occur this October or on any other date (I well know that correlation is not causation). I have no subtle purpose to share, it's just for the curiosity of this pattern.

p.s. Probably the cause is because October is my birthday.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can’t fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhssad,[],0

346,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"The government is releasing the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP) report as early as June 1st. It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen. Rubio's Comments](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ufo-reports-should-be-taken-seriously-rubio-says-11621245038) [WaPo Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/23/ufo-report-covid-bill/)

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade. Additionally, Raytheon is the go-to company for research into lasers, targeted radiation, or proton beams (still no word on proton torpedoes). ([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force?

Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies or (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

Good support on the \~74$ line, looks to be holding, my personal stop loss is at 70$ if that breaks it's open to free fall.

On the 1H candles, break out over 50ma, resistance at 200ma, rsi peaking at 70, propably will come down to get support from 50ma again before breaking over the 200ma.

Nasdaq index looks to have made bottoms at 13000 and is on long trend again, or at least will go sideways for the summer period, between 13k and 14k.

NOT a investing advice, personally im long with 2040 shares target 100$ average price 77$

The way I see it is there is no way that the price of SPCE will stay the same from today going into Monday. 

One of three options are going to play out.

1. Successful test flight
2. Test flight delayed, again 
3. Unsuccessful test flight

Regardless of the situation, the needle is going to move a LOT. How are you playing this rocket ride? 

I have a few 17p and 16p expiring Monday and a few HUGELY OTM calls expiring next Friday. I’m more expecting a total failure, but on the off chance it’s a huge success those calls are going to print.

369,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0
1855,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"The cruise line industry has been nearly brought to extinction during the pandemic, but with the vaccines being distributed, cruise lines are making a major comeback. 
This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let’s go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there’s a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166

5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

1890,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Nokia now has 160 5G deals, of which 63 are in active deployment. And Nokia is currently engaged in 60 trial periods where it’s competing to win the contract. Ericsson, which previously led Nokia, has only received 138 global 5G commercial contracts. Huawei had won 91 global 5G contracts.

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive. It helps enable a 50 – 60% reduction in energy use compared to previous chips. This lowers the total cost of ownership for wireless providers and it is a great selling point.",nhqc9p,['NOK'],1
1891,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

1893,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can’t fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhssad,[],0

1900,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"The government is releasing the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP) report as early as June 1st. It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen. Rubio's Comments](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ufo-reports-should-be-taken-seriously-rubio-says-11621245038) [WaPo Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/23/ufo-report-covid-bill/)

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force?

Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself.  Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued.  MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down  - whatever could they do with that cash?  $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down.  With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them.  And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone.  FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one.  Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point.  It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason.  FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution:  they will monitor bone density.  That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer.  Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs.  Truly can’t fucking lose.  so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhtad9,[],0

Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies or (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

1921,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0
1922,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"So first of all, Im not rich. I dont have 100 thousands of dollars. But if you only listen to rich people for advice, then this DD isnt for you. 

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19,10 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

I really think this is huge for GOOG/GOOGL ad revenue. According to socialblade, there are 56 million channels under 1k subs(10-999) as of November 13 2020. Youtube previously demonetized smaller channels but I guess is going all in.

From Youtube: ""YouTube’s right to monetize: YouTube has the right to monetize all content on the platform and ads may appear on videos from channels not in the YouTube Partner Program.""

2382,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"If you're still kicking yourself about not putting your entire 401k into Shopify and getting those sweet 40x gains, I think BIGC may be one of the next hot stocks.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

2387,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

2389,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options.

2392,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Nokia now has 160 5G deals, of which 63 are in active deployment. And Nokia is currently engaged in 60 trial periods where it’s competing to win the contract.

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

2393,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

2395,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

**Legitimate company and not a meme?** Yes. 

20 year old company with a solid balance sheet, solid earnings, profitable every quarter, and beat EPS consistently all of last year. Every damn quarter they provided positive guidance, yet the wallstreet cucks would still under-cut their expectations, only for CSIQ to crush earnings.

**Does it have a future?** Yes

They make fucking solar panels, and have been doing it for 20 years! Tesla solar roofs are meme products. When my employer wanted to add solar panels for our 3 factories, we didn't call up Tesla. We called up a EPC firm who chose Canadian Solar as the supplier.

**What are the numbers?** Yes.

Lots of cash, lots of assets, low debt, consistent income etc.

**Are there any catalysts that would make it moon?** Yes

600 shares since 2012. I bought them when I started making real money in my adult job. I was an intern at Canadian Solar in 2009.

2402,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"The government is releasing the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP) report as early as June 1st. It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen. Rubio's Comments](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ufo-reports-should-be-taken-seriously-rubio-says-11621245038) [WaPo Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/23/ufo-report-covid-bill/)

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade. Additionally, Raytheon is the go-to company for research into lasers, targeted radiation, or proton beams (still no word on proton torpedoes). ([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force?

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money.  This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when.  How can I be so sure?  They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.  

Should you trust me?  Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips.  Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago?  We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist?  What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill.  Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.  

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal.  They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year.  Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay? 

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no.  They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted.  Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap.  They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner.  Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth.  The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here.  Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks.  You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear.  No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential?  Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself.  Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued.  MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down  - whatever could they do with that cash?  $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down.  With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them.  And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone.  FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one.  Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point.  It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason.  FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution:  they will monitor bone density.  That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer.  Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs.

If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies or (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

2423,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0
2424,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"So first of all, Im not rich. I dont have 100 thousands of dollars. But if you only listen to rich people for advice, then this DD isnt for you. 

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19,10 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

May 26 2019 NYT posted an article about a UFO sighting. Spy proceeds to sell off for 4+ days. 283-273

April 29 2020 CNN post a massive UFO article. It is filled with classified UFO reports and sighting.

SPY drops from 291-279 over the course of 4 days.

May 16 2021 60 minutes posts a revealing article of our alien overlords. Spy drops from 415-405 over the course of 4 DAYS!

2925,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"So I went down the rabbit hole a while back after being a meme stock bear.  Mind blown. All I have to say is watch Wes Christian. I had been trading for a decade and you apes opened this world up to me.  

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It’s nuts

2930,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"If you're still kicking yourself about not putting your entire 401k into Shopify and getting those sweet 40x gains, I think BIGC may be one of the next hot stocks.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

2935,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

2937,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options.

2940,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Nokia now has 160 5G deals, of which 63 are in active deployment. And Nokia is currently engaged in 60 trial periods where it’s competing to win the contract. Ericsson, which previously led Nokia, has only received 138 global 5G commercial contracts. Huawei had won 91 global 5G contracts.

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

2941,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnjdj8xvlg071.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b514632f262f311d158e14416251b98f6d00e

 

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

2943,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs.

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen.

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab.

These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money.  This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when.  How can I be so sure?  They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies or (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

2971,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0
2972,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"So first of all, Im not rich. I dont have 100 thousands of dollars. But if you only listen to rich people for advice, then this DD isnt for you. 

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19,10 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

To sum it up, from a purely business perspective, you will bet on TLRY. However, if you are looking at betting on an investment vehicle that can capitalize on the troubles of some of the smaller marijuana companies, SNDL will fit the bill.",nhzt5b,[],0

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It’s nuts

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

3229,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

3231,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options.

3234,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Nokia now has 160 5G deals, of which 63 are in active deployment. And Nokia is currently engaged in 60 trial periods where it’s competing to win the contract.

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

3235,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

3237,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs.

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen.

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade.

([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force?

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money.  This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when.  How can I be so sure?  They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies or (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

3265,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0
3266,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"So first of all, Im not rich. I dont have 100 thousands of dollars. But if you only listen to rich people for advice, then this DD isnt for you. 

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19,10 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

\*\*\*My average in @ $5.10, currently at $5.52, May 20th, 2021

I am not investing in the company as a get-rich-quick scheme, but plan to hold long term. **Saphyr** technology will continue to improve directly with design improvements, but also indirectly with the data that it continuously collects will create more accurate correlations of DNA with individual predispositions for disease. 

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community. 

* **Large institutional investments have nearly tripled (3X) from 5% to 14%.** 
* **Earnings beat expectations in Q1 2021.**
* **Recent large insider procurement.**
* **New patents, research breakthroughs, Large Lab facility adoption.**

This is why I have a strong conviction for **Bionano Genomics (BNGO)** being a great growth stock to investigate and follow. 

There are some negative indicators fundamentally, but considering Bionano is still in its infancy I am very optimistic in my outlook. The positives tip the scale in my opinion and at the very least, Bianano Genomics (BNGO) should be on your watchlist!

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,[],0
5133,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

5144,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"The cruise line industry has been nearly brought to extinction during the pandemic, but with the vaccines being distributed, cruise lines are making a major comeback. 
This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let’s go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there’s a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

Orders are being canceled, and you even have UFC fighters calling them out [https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-elon-musk-beneil-dariush-ufc-model-3-loaner/](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-elon-musk-beneil-dariush-ufc-model-3-loaner/) 

TBH I am just pissed Dariush gets a loaner and I don't, so I have decided to go about it my own way. I have puts and I am going to buy more puts tomorrow and hold it until it makes me enough money to buy my car cash. 

Support my vision fellow apes.

W-shape with today's price action.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

5164,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"So I went down the rabbit hole a while back after being a meme stock bear.  Mind blown. All I have to say is watch Wes Christian. I had been trading for a decade and you apes opened this world up to me.  

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It’s nuts

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

5174,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

5176,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options.

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

5180,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnjdj8xvlg071.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b514632f262f311d158e14416251b98f6d00e

 

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

5182,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.

# TA Notes

* Resistance still at 416-418 gap fill on the 1d timeframe
* Support at 415-414
* 20 SMMA support. I believe we need to test the 20 SMMA so this will be dip buying opportunity if bullish.
* Expecting small moves today. Play tight and ITM 0dte if you're a degen.
* Bulls need to break 418 and test support. I think we top out at around 420 if 418 support holds.
* Bears need to break 414. I don't think we go below 410 tho but we shall see.
* Bullish 🎯 - 419 - 420 - 420.53 - 422.29
* Bearish 🎯 - 412 - 410 - 409.08 - 408.07 - 407.12
* Not pictured but we are at the upper level of the BB. BTFD if bullish.

Well, October seems the answer.

From Wiki: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_largest\_daily\_changes\_in\_the\_Dow\_Jones\_Industrial\_Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_daily_changes_in_the_Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average)

I know, in the last week many talked about a possible future crash in the stock market, inflation and there is too much liquidity and bla bla bla. I am not here to say the next crash will occur this October or on any other date (I well know that correlation is not causation). I have no subtle purpose to share, it's just for the curiosity of this pattern.

p.s. Probably the cause is because October is my birthday.

I don't know if there is something to discuss this, but I would appreciate your opinions.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can’t fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhssad,[],0

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen.

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade.

([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force?

If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.

5210,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0

Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19,10 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

5219,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"While SNDL’s market cap is only about a fifth of TLRY, it has more cash than Tilray on its balance sheet. In its earnings release, SNDL said that as of May 7, it had $752 million of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet.


Now, there are two narratives if you are interested in buying SNDL stock. First is the bullish one that points to the ample cash on its balance sheet. As I noted in a previous article, SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.



To sum it up, from a purely business perspective, you will bet on TLRY. However, if you are looking at betting on an investment vehicle that can capitalize on the troubles of some of the smaller marijuana companies, SNDL will fit the bill.",nhzt5b,[],0
5223,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Hi everyone!

I come here to ask people that are (way) more knowledgable than me about stocks and how I should be getting on the market, according to you guys. For context, I am 18 years old, currently studying to get a college diploma in Canada, and I am currently well off. I still live with my parents, pay only for my stuff and my extras (certain streaming accounts, for example), and am in the transition of taking all of these payments for me (cellphone, for example). 

I have been seeing a lot of ads about Wealthsimple Trade, all saying it is super easy, clear, and so on, but I’m still a bit doubtful. I have to app installed on my phone, but haven’t started anything yet, and wanted actual opinions before getting it started. How is the experience from people who actually use it? Would you recommend it, or should I find another solution? 

Also, more generally speaking, how should one get into stocks? Are there certain basic things one should read about, or that they should know? Are there different approaches to buying stocks? The Wealthsimple question is the most important, but if I can get general advices too, I’ll take as many as I possible can.

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",nh8f2j,[],0
5777,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

5788,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"The cruise line industry has been nearly brought to extinction during the pandemic, but with the vaccines being distributed, cruise lines are making a major comeback. 
This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let’s go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there’s a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

5818,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

5820,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options.

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

5824,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnjdj8xvlg071.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b514632f262f311d158e14416251b98f6d00e

 

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

The potential is so large it's not a cherry anymore, but rather a pineapple on the cake 🍍🎂

* Resistance still at 416-418 gap fill on the 1d timeframe
* Support at 415-414

* Expecting small moves today. Play tight and ITM 0dte if you're a degen.
* Bulls need to break 418 and test support. I think we top out at around 420 if 418 support holds.
* Bears need to break 414. I don't think we go below 410 tho but we shall see.
* Bullish 🎯 - 419 - 420 - 420.53 - 422.29

I know, in the last week many talked about a possible future crash in the stock market, inflation and there is too much liquidity and bla bla bla. I am not here to say the next crash will occur this October or on any other date (I well know that correlation is not causation). I have no subtle purpose to share, it's just for the curiosity of this pattern.

p.s. Probably the cause is because October is my birthday.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can’t fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhssad,[],0

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen. Rubio's Comments](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ufo-reports-should-be-taken-seriously-rubio-says-11621245038) [WaPo Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/23/ufo-report-covid-bill/)

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade.

([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force?

If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.

5853,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0

Edit: nice close at 19,14$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19,10 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

5862,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"While SNDL’s market cap is only about a fifth of TLRY, it has more cash than Tilray on its balance sheet. In its earnings release, SNDL said that as of May 7, it had $752 million of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet.


Now, there are two narratives if you are interested in buying SNDL stock. First is the bullish one that points to the ample cash on its balance sheet. As I noted in a previous article, SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.



To sum it up, from a purely business perspective, you will bet on TLRY. However, if you are looking at betting on an investment vehicle that can capitalize on the troubles of some of the smaller marijuana companies, SNDL will fit the bill.",nhzt5b,[],0

5871,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"After Northland Securities upgraded LendingTree’s price target to $225 (approx. 9.5% upside), I decided to do a quick company analysis and outlook to see if I agree with their PT.

   * Suggests a positive outlook for the company as the price was bought above the price it was trading at then

# Industry Overview and Outlook

* Low-interest rates have fueled consumer demand for refinancing existing debt and access to new debt
* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs
   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending
* Strong economy coupled with strong employment numbers have led to a surge in home sales
   * Pandemic-drriven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

   * Approx. 79.3% growth since loan origination value of $41.4B from 2017
* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

6123,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets," So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

6134,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"The cruise line industry has been nearly brought to extinction during the pandemic, but with the vaccines being distributed, cruise lines are making a major comeback. 
This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let’s go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there’s a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

W-shape with today's price action.

* For the w-shape to hold true we need to push over 418.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It’s nuts

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

6164,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

6166,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options.

6169,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Nokia now has 160 5G deals, of which 63 are in active deployment. And Nokia is currently engaged in 60 trial periods where it’s competing to win the contract.

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

6170,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnjdj8xvlg071.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b514632f262f311d158e14416251b98f6d00e

 

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

6172,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.

I know, in the last week many talked about a possible future crash in the stock market, inflation and there is too much liquidity and bla bla bla. I am not here to say the next crash will occur this October or on any other date (I well know that correlation is not causation). I have no subtle purpose to share, it's just for the curiosity of this pattern.

p.s. Probably the cause is because October is my birthday.

I don't know if there is something to discuss this, but I would appreciate your opinions.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can’t fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhssad,[],0

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen.

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade.

([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force?

If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

6199,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19,10 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

Now, there are two narratives if you are interested in buying SNDL stock. First is the bullish one that points to the ample cash on its balance sheet. As I noted in a previous article, SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.



To sum it up, from a purely business perspective, you will bet on TLRY. However, if you are looking at betting on an investment vehicle that can capitalize on the troubles of some of the smaller marijuana companies, SNDL will fit the bill.",nhzt5b,[],0

6216,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"After Northland Securities upgraded LendingTree’s price target to $225 (approx. 9.5% upside), I decided to do a quick company analysis and outlook to see if I agree with their PT.

   * Suggests a positive outlook for the company as the price was bought above the price it was trading at then

# Industry Overview and Outlook

* Low-interest rates have fueled consumer demand for refinancing existing debt and access to new debt
* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs
   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending

   * Approx. 79.3% growth since loan origination value of $41.4B from 2017
* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

6984,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"The cruise line industry has been nearly brought to extinction during the pandemic, but with the vaccines being distributed, cruise lines are making a major comeback. 
This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let’s go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there’s a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special. 

Next week, either Jay Farner gets flashy (new dividend, massive auto rollout, something new) and starts publicly pushing back against Ishbia, or RKT continues downward. I think it’s 50/50 but looks ripe for anyone looking for a straddle yolo, with IV not as bad as it was before.

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.

I really think this is huge for GOOG/GOOGL ad revenue. According to socialblade, there are 56 million channels under 1k subs(10-999) as of November 13 2020. Youtube previously demonetized smaller channels but I guess is going all in.

From Youtube: ""YouTube’s right to monetize: YouTube has the right to monetize all content on the platform and ads may appear on videos from channels not in the YouTube Partner Program.""

7009,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"If you're still kicking yourself about not putting your entire 401k into Shopify and getting those sweet 40x gains, I think BIGC may be one of the next hot stocks.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

7014,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

7016,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options.

7019,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Nokia now has 160 5G deals, of which 63 are in active deployment. And Nokia is currently engaged in 60 trial periods where it’s competing to win the contract. Ericsson, which previously led Nokia, has only received 138 global 5G commercial contracts. Huawei had won 91 global 5G contracts.

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

7020,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

7022,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can’t fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhssad,[],0

7029,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"The government is releasing the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP) report as early as June 1st. It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen. Rubio's Comments](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ufo-reports-should-be-taken-seriously-rubio-says-11621245038) [WaPo Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/23/ufo-report-covid-bill/)

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade. Additionally, Raytheon is the go-to company for research into lasers, targeted radiation, or proton beams (still no word on proton torpedoes). ([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force? This is a \~2 month play to see if we can get more decisive acknowledgement of the technology whether it is manned or alien, either way it could make for an interesting news summer.",nht2ep,[],1

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money.  This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when.  How can I be so sure?  They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.  

Should you trust me?  Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips.  Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago?  We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist?  What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill.  Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.  

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal.  They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year.  Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay? 

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no.  They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted.  Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap.  They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner.  Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth.  The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here.  Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks.  You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear.  No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential?  Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself.  Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued.  MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down  - whatever could they do with that cash?  $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down.  With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them.  And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone.  FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one.  Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point.  It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason.  FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution:  they will monitor bone density.  That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer.  Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs.  Truly can’t fucking lose.  so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhtad9,[],0

If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

7049,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

7844,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"The cruise line industry has been nearly brought to extinction during the pandemic, but with the vaccines being distributed, cruise lines are making a major comeback. 
This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let’s go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there’s a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special.

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

7874,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

7879,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Nokia now has 160 5G deals, of which 63 are in active deployment. And Nokia is currently engaged in 60 trial periods where it’s competing to win the contract. Ericsson, which previously led Nokia, has only received 138 global 5G commercial contracts. Huawei had won 91 global 5G contracts.

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive. It helps enable a 50 – 60% reduction in energy use compared to previous chips. This lowers the total cost of ownership for wireless providers and it is a great selling point.",nhqc9p,['NOK'],1
7880,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

7882,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can’t fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhssad,[],0

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen. Rubio's Comments](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ufo-reports-should-be-taken-seriously-rubio-says-11621245038) [WaPo Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/23/ufo-report-covid-bill/)

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force?

MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down  - whatever could they do with that cash?  $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down.  With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them.  And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone.  FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one.  Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point.  It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason.  FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution:  they will monitor bone density.  That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer.  Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs.

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.  Basically the OG pioneered the discount brokerage business.  You should read about his life, such a cool mfer.

7909,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0
7910,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"So first of all, Im not rich. I dont have 100 thousands of dollars. But if you only listen to rich people for advice, then this DD isnt for you. 

Edit: nice close at 19$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

As I noted in a previous article, SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.

# Industry Overview and Outlook

* Low-interest rates have fueled consumer demand for refinancing existing debt and access to new debt
* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs
   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending

   * Approx. 79.3% growth since loan origination value of $41.4B from 2017
* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there’s a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

There is little difference in their lines of business at the moment, margins are similar, products are similar. There’s very little differentiation, he’ll they’re in the same city. UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special. 

Next week, either Jay Farner gets flashy (new dividend, massive auto rollout, something new) and starts publicly pushing back against Ishbia, or RKT continues downward. I think it’s 50/50 but looks ripe for anyone looking for a straddle yolo, with IV not as bad as it was before.

It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

8236,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

8238,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options.

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.**

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

8244,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

I am not here to say the next crash will occur this October or on any other date (I well know that correlation is not causation). I have no subtle purpose to share, it's just for the curiosity of this pattern.

p.s. Probably the cause is because October is my birthday.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can’t fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhssad,[],0

8251,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"The government is releasing the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP) report as early as June 1st. It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen. Rubio's Comments](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ufo-reports-should-be-taken-seriously-rubio-says-11621245038) [WaPo Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/23/ufo-report-covid-bill/)

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade. Additionally, Raytheon is the go-to company for research into lasers, targeted radiation, or proton beams (still no word on proton torpedoes). ([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force? This is a \~2 month play to see if we can get more decisive acknowledgement of the technology whether it is manned or alien, either way it could make for an interesting news summer.",nht2ep,[],1

Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

The way I see it is there is no way that the price of SPCE will stay the same from today going into Monday. 

One of three options are going to play out.

1. Successful test flight
2. Test flight delayed, again 
3. Unsuccessful test flight

Regardless of the situation, the needle is going to move a LOT. How are you playing this rocket ride? 

I have a few 17p and 16p expiring Monday and a few HUGELY OTM calls expiring next Friday. I’m more expecting a total failure, but on the off chance it’s a huge success those calls are going to print.

What are y’all’s positions?

And to all the people saying you wouldn’t touch SPCE with a 40 foot pole, why? The stock is going to move one way or another and if you’re really that against it, buy puts and put your Twitter fingers to work.

This is not financial advice",nhy48w,['SPCE'],0

Unfortunately Tesla is too expensive for me to purchase. I own shares of NIO Should expand  my profile and add ARVL Or just increase my shares with NIO. 

The electric vehicle (EV) space, there are multiple stocks from which to choose that have the potential to deliver exponential gains over the long term. Tesla (TSLA) remains the market leader in the EV segment. However, this disruptive industry is attracting capital from retail and institutional investors because it is expandingÂ  rapidly. This is an indication that EV sector is heating up, which will increase competition for Tesla.

8271,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0
8272,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"So first of all, Im not rich. I dont have 100 thousands of dollars. But if you only listen to rich people for advice, then this DD isnt for you. 

Edit: nice close at 19$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.


Have a good day and may your portfolio be green!",nhyn43,['TSLA'],0
8279,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"While SNDL’s market cap is only about a fifth of TLRY, it has more cash than Tilray on its balance sheet. In its earnings release, SNDL said that as of May 7, it had $752 million of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet.


Now, there are two narratives if you are interested in buying SNDL stock. First is the bullish one that points to the ample cash on its balance sheet. As I noted in a previous article, SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.



To sum it up, from a purely business perspective, you will bet on TLRY. However, if you are looking at betting on an investment vehicle that can capitalize on the troubles of some of the smaller marijuana companies, SNDL will fit the bill.",nhzt5b,[],0

8288,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"After Northland Securities upgraded LendingTree’s price target to $225 (approx. 9.5% upside), I decided to do a quick company analysis and outlook to see if I agree with their PT.

   * Suggests a positive outlook for the company as the price was bought above the price it was trading at then

# Industry Overview and Outlook

* Low-interest rates have fueled consumer demand for refinancing existing debt and access to new debt
* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs
   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending
* Strong economy coupled with strong employment numbers have led to a surge in home sales
   * Pandemic-drriven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006
   * 5.6% increase YoY for homes sold

   * Approx. 79.3% growth since loan origination value of $41.4B from 2017
* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

8679,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"The cruise line industry has been nearly brought to extinction during the pandemic, but with the vaccines being distributed, cruise lines are making a major comeback. 
This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let’s go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there’s a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It’s nuts

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

8709,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

8711,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options.

8714,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Nokia now has 160 5G deals, of which 63 are in active deployment. And Nokia is currently engaged in 60 trial periods where it’s competing to win the contract.

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

8715,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnjdj8xvlg071.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b514632f262f311d158e14416251b98f6d00e

 

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

8717,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.

What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs.

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen.

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.

8744,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0

Edit: nice close at 19$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

8761,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"After Northland Securities upgraded LendingTree’s price target to $225 (approx. 9.5% upside), I decided to do a quick company analysis and outlook to see if I agree with their PT. 

# Company Overview

**LendingTree (NASDAQ: TREE)** is America’s largest online marketplace connecting lenders and borrowers. LendingTree empowers lenders to shop for financial services the same way one would shop for hotel stays or airline tickets- comparing multiple offers from a nationwide network of over 800 partners that offer their customers services such as mortgage loans, mortgage refinances, auto loans, personal loans, business loans, and much more.

# Industry Overview and Outlook

* Low-interest rates have fueled consumer demand for refinancing existing debt and access to new debt
* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs
   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending

   * Approx. 79.3% growth since loan origination value of $41.4B from 2017
* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

9056,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"The cruise line industry has been nearly brought to extinction during the pandemic, but with the vaccines being distributed, cruise lines are making a major comeback. 
This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let’s go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there’s a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

9088,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

9091,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Nokia now has 160 5G deals, of which 63 are in active deployment. And Nokia is currently engaged in 60 trial periods where it’s competing to win the contract. Ericsson, which previously led Nokia, has only received 138 global 5G commercial contracts. Huawei had won 91 global 5G contracts.

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive. It helps enable a 50 – 60% reduction in energy use compared to previous chips. This lowers the total cost of ownership for wireless providers and it is a great selling point.",nhqc9p,['NOK'],1
9092,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

9094,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can’t fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhssad,[],0

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen.

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force?

They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted.  Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap.  They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner.  Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth.  The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here.  Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks.  You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear.  No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential?  Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself.  Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued.  MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down  - whatever could they do with that cash?  $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down.  With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them.  And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone.  FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one.  Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point.  It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason.  FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution:  they will monitor bone density.  That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer.  Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs.  Truly can’t fucking lose.  so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhtad9,[],0

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

9121,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0

Edit: nice close at 19$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world

   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

The long story can be read in the links below.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

9412,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

9414,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options.

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

9418,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnjdj8xvlg071.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b514632f262f311d158e14416251b98f6d00e

 

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

9420,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

The potential is so large it's not a cherry anymore, but rather a pineapple on the cake 🍍🎂

* Resistance still at 416-418 gap fill on the 1d timeframe
* Support at 415-414

* Expecting small moves today. Play tight and ITM 0dte if you're a degen.
* Bulls need to break 418 and test support. I think we top out at around 420 if 418 support holds.
* Bears need to break 414. I don't think we go below 410 tho but we shall see.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs.

It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen.

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade.

([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force?

If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.

9447,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0
9448,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"So first of all, Im not rich. I dont have 100 thousands of dollars. But if you only listen to rich people for advice, then this DD isnt for you. 

Edit: nice close at 19$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.


Have a good day and may your portfolio be green!",nhyn43,['TSLA'],0
9455,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"While SNDL’s market cap is only about a fifth of TLRY, it has more cash than Tilray on its balance sheet. In its earnings release, SNDL said that as of May 7, it had $752 million of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet.


Now, there are two narratives if you are interested in buying SNDL stock. First is the bullish one that points to the ample cash on its balance sheet. As I noted in a previous article, SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.



To sum it up, from a purely business perspective, you will bet on TLRY. However, if you are looking at betting on an investment vehicle that can capitalize on the troubles of some of the smaller marijuana companies, SNDL will fit the bill.",nhzt5b,[],0

* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs
   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending

   * Approx. 79.3% growth since loan origination value of $41.4B from 2017
* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Position: 2000 shares @ $55

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future.

9901,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

9903,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options.

9906,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Nokia now has 160 5G deals, of which 63 are in active deployment. And Nokia is currently engaged in 60 trial periods where it’s competing to win the contract. Ericsson, which previously led Nokia, has only received 138 global 5G commercial contracts. Huawei had won 91 global 5G contracts.

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive.

9907,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

9909,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can’t fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhssad,[],0

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade. Additionally, Raytheon is the go-to company for research into lasers, targeted radiation, or proton beams (still no word on proton torpedoes). ([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force? This is a \~2 month play to see if we can get more decisive acknowledgement of the technology whether it is manned or alien, either way it could make for an interesting news summer.",nht2ep,[],1

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money.  This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when.  How can I be so sure?  They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.  

Should you trust me?  Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips.  Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago?  We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist?  What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill.  Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.  

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal.  They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year.  Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay? 

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no.  They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted.  Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap.  They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner.  Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth.  The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here.  Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks.  You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear.  No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential?  Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself.  Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued.  MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down  - whatever could they do with that cash?  $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down.  With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them.  And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone.  FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one.  Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point.  It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason.  FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution:  they will monitor bone density.  That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer.  Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs.  Truly can’t fucking lose.  so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese.",nhtad9,[],0

Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.

9936,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets," **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy ever MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8lmq168hi071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af5f7ce7e179b59a18a198aaab1447e6177afc8

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/6d1lvnx9hi071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=24595178d1e6e808074bd46a7e8ad6a8442b3e98

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When full operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. 



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Canada will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Canadian one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only Canadian but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

9954,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"Look, just give it to me straight no chaser. Is this a bad idea, because I've already done it. Now I'm wondering, do I double down or triple down? It gained like 1000% in 3 years since 2017. Now we've had a 60% correction...c'mon surely this has gotta be the play of the fucking century. My uncertainty really stems from the fact that...im a retard, the stock is still going down, so does everyone else know something I dont?

Before anyone asks, no, I know nothing about what Alteryx does, dont ask me about a balance sheet, I only learned what that was 2 days ago, and Im not fucking looking so dont tell me any of that. Quite simply, the blue line is down and I want a lambo. Does this sound good?
