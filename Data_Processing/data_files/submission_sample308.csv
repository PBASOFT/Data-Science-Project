### Media Release

**Munich, May 20, 2021:** Lilium GmbH (“Lilium”), positioned to be a global leader in regional electric air mobility with the development of its electric vertical take-off and landing jet (“Lilium Jet”), and Luxembourg-based Luxaviation Group, one of the largest business aircraft and helicopter operators worldwide, today announced that Luxaviation Group plans to support Lilium in building out airline operations in Europe.

Lilium’s vision for a flexible transportation ecosystem is supported by world-class partners. Luxaviation Group brings over 60 years of experience operating passenger service with hundreds of aircraft under management and 10 Air Operator Certificates (“AOCs”) across Europe.

Building on Luxaviation Group's track record, which includes securing the first European Union Aviation Safety Agency AOC approval for a business jet operator, the parties anticipate Luxaviation Group will become responsible for parts of the airline operations being developed by Lilium. This includes securing necessary approvals and managing pilots, which will be trained following a type rating concept developed by Lufthansa Aviation Training, another Lilium partner. As Lilium continues developing its launch networks in Europe for the planned commercial launch in 2024, Luxaviation Group will also work with Lilium on the development of its best-in-class customer experience, built around Lilium’s digital airline platform and the 7-Seater Lilium Jet.

“We are proud to be working alongside Luxaviation Group, a leading operator in the aviation sector with a track record in offering an innovative and customer-focused service, to build out the Lilium network in Europe. This marks a key milestone as we prepare for launch, and we look forward to working together to provide an exceptional airline service for our passengers,” explains Remo Gerber, Chief Operating Officer at Lilium.

Patrick Hansen, Group CEO at Luxaviation Group said: “Electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft will fundamentally change the way we travel, and the Lilium network is poised to be at the forefront of this sea change in aviation”. Christophe Lapierre, Head of Strategy of Luxaviation Group adds: “We are very pleased to have been selected by Lilium to be their partner in aircraft operations. As an early believer in advanced air mobility, we look forward to bringing our experience and credentials to the partnership with Lilium and building out a service that will truly feel like a first of its kind.”

Lilium has previously announced plans for launch networks in Germany through partnerships with Munich, Nuremberg, Dusseldorf, and Cologne/Bonn airports.

Using the 7-Seater Lilium Jet, an electric vertical take-off and landing jet, offering leading capacity, low noise and high performance, Lilium is building a transport network and service for people and goods. Working in partnership with world-leading aerospace, technology and infrastructure partners, commercial operations are planned to launch in 2024. Lilium’s 600+-strong team includes over 400 aerospace engineers and a leadership responsible for delivering some of the most successful aircraft in aviation history.

AVIR - Atea Pharma

\- Is a biotech company which focuses on oral antiviral drugs, main focuses are covid (e.g. treating people who caught the virus, not the vaccine) which is in Phase 3 of testing (should hear results in the next few months, but already licensed to Roche) and Hep C (much earlier stages). What caught my eyes is that they became profitable this year, and they earnings are estimated to grow massively \~90% and generally seems to have reached all time low of around \~$22 vs an ATH of almost \~$90 

&#x200B;

CRSR - Corsair

\- Gaming and streaming equiment, another company that seems grossly undervalued. They have had a massive 2020 thanks to Covid which is expected to keep growing as the gaming industry in general. After a strong rally post IPO, where it reached an ATH of \~$50 is currently sitting at $30 and generally sees to have a pretyt low P/E ratio.

[Smart Mirror Product Action Shot](https://imgur.com/a/ZNJri3r)

$CAPC is a debt-free penny stock exempt company currently trading on the higher-tier OTCQB markets with audited financials and fully SEC reporting.

During last week's conference call, CEO confirmed that Smart Mirrors will begin shipping in June on Capstone's website and **will be available on Amazon.** The company confirmed that the Smart Mirror will be in big box retailers in second half of 2021. Capstone products currently sell in major retailers like Costco, Home Depot, Walmart, Target and more. It's amazon reviews for it's previous products are 5-stars. They know how to build a quality product that sells.

[Tweet from Capstone Companies, Inc.](https://twitter.com/CAPC_Capstone/status/1395793359697031174)

The number of outstanding shares is just under 50M with the company directors owning nearly half of the shares, leaving a float of 24M. Directors have never sold a share over company's history - zero dilution. In fact they added 400K worth of shares in the last couple of months in the open market with plans to buy another 750K shares through August. This company believes in the product.

[Form 5 - Directors Buying Shares](https://www.otcmarkets.com/filing/html?id=14861233&guid=geqnUaiFu4E-Kth)

This will easily appreciate in value once revenues from Smart Mirror are realized. This company is primed for growth and the corporation is already preparing for possible uplisting to NASDAQ.

[Establishment of Auditing Commitee](https://imgur.com/a/BccWiwL)


Beyond this, the Smart Mirrors are just cool - people want them and the price point for $CAPC mirrors is huge for what it offers. Only $699 starting price means it is affordable for the average person, and you can mirror your phone and engage with the mirror just like you would a tablet or touch-screen PC. I think this product blows $LULU mirror out of the water as far as functionality and price point.
