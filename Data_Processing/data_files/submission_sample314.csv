If this were to happen what would that mean for Alphabet and its shareholders?

Iâ€™ve been dealing with a Roth IRA through my parentâ€™s financial advisor so Iâ€™ve been putting money into that for around a year. Iâ€™ve recently found myself with some extra spending money in my savings and would rather invest it then let it sit in a savings collecting dust. Anything would be appreciated (YT videos, books, websites, articles, etc.) Thanks in advance!",ngl1i4,[],0
409,2021-05-20,stocks,"The reason you are frustrated / don't understand the results of market action is because of the time you entered the market likely. Millions of young new investors entered the market during the COVID shutdown. This led to rates being extremely low due to the pandemic, stimulus (cash) available to more people than ever, and massive equity investments and buybacks. The end result is much of the stock market being now (overvalued) in profit taking range for major institutions. (who have a much larger impact on the stock market than retail investors) Nothing will make sense right now, and even in the near future, in fact it may very well get even more risky and volatile because rates being low and inflation are serious concerns. Rates can't possible stay low forever and will climb at some point. Ask any experienced trader what happens when rates go up in the market... typically you see heavy selling action and an alternative switch of money from stocks to bonds/gold/or etc. Right now, you can have a FANG stock for example that can crush earnings and it doesn't mean they are fair game for a institution to not dump. Why? because context is everything in this market, pull up a chart of major FANG's and see their progress the past year and a half, it's been quite the massive runup. That rollercoaster up, can, will and has effected the outcome of earnings in the present. The market is not just valued in the present by those who have the liquidity to move it, they value things in a more broad spectrum. Rates, Valuation of stock price, run up levels of the stock, future performance is relative to all of this to them. Just remember they hit the buy button when the stock was trading at an undervalued level, and hit the sell button at the top. They master this game, they have high speed computers, algorithms, its down to a science. You will NEVER be able to compete with them, but you CAN buy when they do at the low if you do your due diligence. Hope this helps those of you who question earnings results lately with market fairness.",ngltn9,[],0

624,2021-05-20,stocks,"From [bloomberg's article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-12/hertz-picks-knighthead-certares-offer-in-bankruptcy-auction):

> In a deal that hands a huge victory to shareholders of bankrupt Hertz Global Holdings Inc., the car renter picked Knighthead Capital Management and Certares Management to buy the company out of Chapter 11, capping a dramatic brawl for control of the company.
> 
> The deal, which gives a reorganized Hertz an enterprise value of $7.43 billion, was picked over an offer from a competing group led by Centerbridge Partners, Warburg Pincus and Dundon Capital Partners, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the plan hasnâ€™t been made public. The Knighthead-Certares plan would give equity holders a recovery of about $8 a share -- a package thatâ€™s made up of about $240 million in cash and warrants for nearly 20% of the reorganized company, the people said.
> 
> Hertz shares -- which up until two months ago were faced with the prospects of being completely wiped out under an earlier plan -- soared as much as 41% Wednesday to as high as $5.19. That approached a high of $6.25 last June, when traders snapping up penny stocks on the popular Robinhood app sought to defy decades of convention and make money on a bankrupt company.
> 
> Representatives for Knighthead, Certares and Warburg Pincus declined to comment, while Hertz, Dundon and Centerbridge didnâ€™t immediately provide comment.
> 
> 
> Hertz shares soar above $4 on bankruptcy exit plans
> The Knighthead-Certares groupâ€™s win brings the pandemicâ€™s biggest Chapter 11 case nearer to a close, with Hertz seeking to exit court protection in June. Judge Mary Walrath must approve the final plan in Delaware bankruptcy court.
> 
> Investment firms have been dueling over ownership of Hertz for weeks, with both groups seeking to top the other with multiple rounds of proposals. An earlier Knighthead proposal valued Hertzâ€™s equity at around $2.25 a share, with an enterprise value of $6.2 billion, Bloomberg previously reported.
> 
> As part of the winning plan, Apollo Global Management has committed $1.5 billion of preferred equity. Investors also would have the option to participate in a $1.6 billion rights offering.
> 
> The competition came amid surging demand for rentals and summer travel that has let many car renters raise prices while still leaving them without enough vehicles for customers to drive off the lot. Rival Avis Budget Group Inc. has seen its shares more than double this year.
> 
> Final proposals from both groups offered lenders and bondholders full repayment along with the share recovery, a relative rarity in bankruptcy proceedings. Hertz initially chose an iteration of the Centerbridge groupâ€™s plan, and Walrath last month approved a so-called breakup fee for those funds if they were later outbid.
> 
> Hertz sought bankruptcy protection in May 2020 when the near-total shutdown of the global travel industry sent its rental revenues plunging. Equity holders initially appeared to be wiped out, while junior bondholders were slated to take a haircut. Still, Hertz became a popular stock among day traders, who sent shares rocketing on optimism that they could defy the norms of bankruptcy court and win a payout. The stock frenzy even briefly helped the company fund its bankruptcy by selling new equity.
> 
> The case is Hertz Corp. 20-11218, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).

Can someone explain why its shares are not at $8 right now? This seems like an obvious arbitrage opportunity, but I assume I'm misunderstanding the situation.",ngn1zj,[],0
648,2021-05-20,stocks,Several of my stocks are tanking. I donâ€™t see ARKK or EXPI going up to the amounts I bought it (pretty high) anytime soon. Selling those at a loss would free up some money to then reinvest into something like VOO. I know there isnâ€™t a way to predict the market but I am trying to figure out if this is a smarter way to reallocate my funds. I could get some of the money back through taxes but could still lose a good sum. Anyone else in this predicament and any advice as to what to think about?,ngn8yr,[],0
788,2021-05-20,stocks,"I want to slowly learn to better analyze my stock picks.  Most are blue chips that I own so I really haven't had to analyze much.

For example, 20% of my portfolio is AAPL MSFT.  Aapl is cost basis $92.  Msft I'm in at 202.  So I'm pretty secure with those.

I've got HD and UNH HON etc.

So is finviz a good place or is there better places, preferably for free to get various metrics of a stock?

Is there a place or book to learn about p/s p/b forward pe, eps growth, etc?

For example, what should I be looking for in eps growth yoy?  A certain percentage?  

Are earnings and eps the same thing?

What about price to sales?  What's a good ratio?

As a long term holder of AAPL MSFT HD UNH type companies do I really have to constantly monitor all these things?

I don't plan on selling any of those shares for many years.  Easier to just read Motley Fool and various articles, reddt, to keep up on my companies?  ðŸ˜†",ngo9ay,[],1
810,2021-05-20,stocks,"Hello all. I'm newish to investing. I'm 33 and have a general question about the recent massive influx of printed money and how that might affect stock prices going forward. Actually unrelated to that, I wonder, what is your opinion on this bull market ending and crashing hard? To the contrary, my mind is thinking that, in theory, isn't every stock undervalued right now due to the recent 4trillion in printed money, or have we seen the market respond accurately to that already?

If not, isn't it a no-brainer to invest in some top stocks in each sector? I'm starting to see prices everywhere start to slowly creep up in everyday life (fast food is insanely expensive now). I hear companies like BOA increasing their minimum hourly wage to $25 by 2025. I see Chipotle, Target and other companies like Amazon paying between 15-17 an hour for basic work.

Again, wouldn't this mean the current prices we're seeing in the stock market are technically ""undervalued"" and not accurate meaning they should all go up significantly in the next year, 2 or 5? Or will we see a sideways or bear market in the coming years?

I understand this is a broad generalization I'm making, but would like to get some more seasoned advice around the general theme I'm presenting. Thanks for reading.",ngodnr,[],1
