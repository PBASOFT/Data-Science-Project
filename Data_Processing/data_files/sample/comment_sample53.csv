You saying ""$TICKER is going to $Price_Target"" is marginally better.

It's fine if you occasionally post one of the first two comments, but a brief glance at your history showed that they were overwhelmingly the first kind.

It can always break and go against you but it can help you know when to get out. For instance earlier in May  SPY  was coming up on a trendline it got rejected from multiple times for months so I was holding some puts and going small on long positions.

 I even shared it in the daily and got called retarded, but to me its like why ignore something that follows a similar pattern? Next two days it sold off. I didn't know how much it would sell off but when it started taking out moving averages I was like ohh this may be something bigger than a pull back. 

Not that I still don't have bad days but I don't have near as many or ones where I'm just crossing my fingers hoping things go in my favor. It doesn't predict the news, it cant tell you what it will do tomorrow, its just something you can combine with other factors in trading. Like driving with a road map. The map can help you get where you wanna go but the map wont tell you if you're gonna hit a traffic jam, but your awareness that its rush hour could help you with that.

Anyway I think its worth diving into, its helped me. It does take time and experience to get better with. I understand where you're coming from though. I also think TA works best for day trading and stuff like forex and banned currencies.

Because the hype for a short squeeze *is* the manipulation.

There's no legitimate threat of AMC getting squeezed. When everyone got wrecked by GME *actually* squeezing back in January, the strategy to get their money back shifted to enticing people into gambling on a ""get rich quick"" scheme that had a nice ring to it about fucking with ""the man""

Now they've convinced a huge number of people to be *happy* about being sold a massively inflated asset and being left holding the bag.

Having a long moderate inflation creep of 3-4% over an entire fiscal year is arguably worse than a one-off 6-7% reading. Because as the inflation creeps into average cost of living, it drives down market liquidity and further depresses the market.",[],0

Think about it. No one thinks TWTR is going to $145 so people like theta gang are happy to sell me calls at a low price because they believe it’s going to expire at 0. To me that creates a bias putting pressure against the contract making it almost worthless. If anything changes to make that bias go positive it will inflate the options prices (still with low volume) to create a options market where the bias is to the upside and exit the trade then. 

I believe that bias to the upside will be after a new all time high is made. Hopefully within 6-9 months if not I roll another year out and continue to do so until the bias changes.",[],1

1831 Ensign article:

> Not only do we know about the existence of people on other worlds; Latter-day Saints know also that people from other worlds visit the earth! Earth has been receiving visitors from outer space for years, and these visitors have been leaving highly intelligent messages for our benefit.

Also the book of Moses, chapter 1:

> there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power. And there are many that now stand, and innumerable are they unto man; but all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and I know them. And the Lord God spake unto Moses, saying: The heavens, they are many, and they cannot be numbered unto man; but they are numbered unto me, for they are mine. And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another come; and there is no end to my works, neither to my words.

Moses 7:

> And were it possible that man could number the particles of the earth, yea, millions of earths like this, it would not be a beginning to the number of thy creations

Brigham Young (via Discourses of Brigham Young):

> there never was a time when there were not Gods and worlds, and men were not passing through the same ordeals that we are now passing through. That course has been from all eternity, and it is and will be to all eternity.”

And D&C 132:

I am not disagreeing with you, but just to share the argument against it that I hear, some believe that these verses are referring to an eternal *cycle* of creation, that a world exists and progresses and its people develop themselves to the point where they, in turn, have the opportunity to create a world and be their God (I'm not saying that this is *my* personal belief per se, just that that is what some particular individuals have explained to me in the past). By this speculative idea, the timeline of creation extends ""from everlasting to everlasting,"" filled with ""millions of earths like this.""

That New Era article from 1971 isn't something that I've read before. That is very interesting to me. My initial thought when I read this was of angelic visitors to the Earth, such as when the angel Moroni visited the young Joseph Smith, Jr. Is heaven on Earth? If not, wouldn't that make angels travelers from outer space? Or when God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph in the First Vision—are they not aliens in that sense as well?

The team performs a raunchy dance and the MC bails before the judgment for . . . reasons? She goes back home to where a traditional family wedding is being prepared then bails on that because . . . uh, she hates her family?  Kind of seemed like a theme at times before.  So then the movie ends with the MC, who has done ZILTCH to remotely redeem herself for anything she's done in the entire movie, and she's been a corrupting influence generally, suddenly decides to act like a kid and go skip rope for an esoteric happy ending that just seems like some bizzare delusion.

Halal basicly means that its allowable for the muslim to consume, its clean, safe, quality, and bring postitive value to the body. Thats why weed is not halal, and tabacco is not halal(its simply because when people are overusing it, it will brings more harm than good, just like why alcohol is not halal. But for medication purpose it is allowable because it brings the positive value to the body). BUT, the most important thing here is, when the muslim body/organization(idk what mufti is in english) certified that its halal, so the muslim consumed it, as we know humans make mistake(not properly clean the utensil for example) the sin will be responsible towards them.

You see this now with any global commodity. Their supply chains have been, and will continue to be severely kneecapped, notably in lumber (homebuilding) and semiconductors (tech/auto).

This is not just due to Covid reduction measures (shutdowns, social distance mandates) but also due to reactive pressure from the labor force. Even if everything reopens today, much of the global labor force has either chosen an early retirement, or refuses to rejoin the labor force for personal reasons (safety, wages, family obligations, etc). 
 
This is obvious in sectors like silicon, because manufacturing got cut in half by covid restrictions (facilities at half capacity). TSMC is the major chipmaker in Taiwan, partnered with AMD. Their last earnings call they discussed the struggle to rehire workers in q1 despite them being cleared for full-capacity operations in late November. They are hiring with good-payimg jobs, but the type of workers they need are opting out of the workforce for an indefinite period of time. This scales out to shipping/transportation, and even the retail locations where goods are purchased.

They are still struggling to meet current demand, and are several quarters from catching up with back-orders. I bought a new GPU from Best Buy in Sept 2019 for $180. I can now buy that same GPU (3 generations old at this point) for $740 on Newegg. Thats the cheapest price I could find.

So now the supply side is creating artificial scarcity for the demand, and the demand side is paying a premium in addition to the general core inflation from cost of living. 

The idea that people have the highest savings in a long time is somehow a boon is questionable. More than half of Americans couldn't afford an emergency $300 expense 2 years ago. If its gone up a bit, that doesn't save you from consumer prices creeping up 4% YoY.

Were ignoring the elephant in the room that the fed let interest rates sit at 1-2% for 3 years during a roaring bull market. They only recently started raising again in q4 2019 citing a need for additional runway in the case of...  HIGHER INFLATION. They were already projecting a slight increase to CPI in 2020 due to sustained low unemployment and China trade war supply bottlenecks. We dumped a pandemic on top of that so now we have no idea where the trade war inflation ends, and the pandemic inflation starts. Keep in mind that historically inflation takes quarters, usually years to manifest after the causal event. We may be seeing just the base effects of YoY + China trade right now. The supply chain disruption inflation could still be ahead.

The same exact thing they did to Toys R Us. This is how over 100% of the shares are shorted. So people think it's going to cost them a fortune to buy the shares they need for their short position. It's really expensive to buy GME right now and they believe there aren't even enough shares to cover all the shorts, because it was over 100%. Because of all this, people think the price is going to skyrocket once all the shorts have to cover, retail owns it all. 

These people bought gamestop stock because they want money. How could you be so naive to think people bought GME because they loved the store and just have to save it lol. You sit there and say the main priority is saving the store, and if they make some money, great. You have to be young to think like this. Just wait until you are on your own and you don't get all your money from mom and dad. You'll realize pretty quickly that you would take the money, not the store.

As for our differing opinions on the subject, I came across an interesting one when preparing my lesson for Gospel Doctrine this week, and that is that ""we can have differing beliefs within the church, the issue comes when you teach those differing beliefs as doctrine.""  I would be wary of teaching anything that goes against the plain language of the scriptures, but would welcome others to their beliefs.

I don't get how an eternal cycle of creation would differ from that of what I set for above.  If the eternal cycle is: birth, God, repeat, then that is no different from the doctrine in the bible, book of mormon, doctrine and covenants, and pearl of great price.  I don't think there is room to teach that the doctrine goes against this.  Even the Gospel Principles manual (a class I taught consistently while serving a mission) has as its final chapter a lesson on exaltation.  This is inarguably the doctrine of the Church.",[],1

From PBS.org:

'Missionaries are expected to cover all expenses of their mission; many Mormon children start saving for their missions when they first get an allowance, at 6 or 7 years old. Many young Mormons also work after-school jobs to save for their missions.'

And the temples are private; apparently not even all Mormons are allowed inside: 

'Upon completion, temples are usually open to the public for a short period of time (an ""open house""). During the open house, the church conducts tours of the temple with missionaries and members from the local area serving as tour guides, and all rooms of the temple are open to the public. The temple is then dedicated as a ""House of the Lord"", after which only members who are deemed worthy are permitted entrance.
Temples are not churches or meetinghouses designated for public weekly worship services, but rather are places of worship open only to the faithful where certain rites of the church must be performed.'  -Wikipedia",[],1

It took me some time, but I found it looking back at an end of the year report.  
  
Members pay 10% of their income to the church- tithing.  
On the tithing slip there are other optional categories. You can put money there if you want, but it does not count towards tithing. The two we need to know about are “Fast Offerings” and “Humanitarian Aid.”  
The money in “Humanitarian Aid” goes to LDS Charities. That’s where they get their money. Donations. 100% from donations. The church does not give any of their excess to charity.  
  
Even funnier is the “Fast Offerings” box. Once a month, members fast. Not eating for two meals or so is the general practice. Then you put the cost of those two meals into “Fast Offerings.”  
That money goes to the Ward (that local area’s congregation). The Bishop of Ward uses that money to held people in the ward who need assistance.  
So again, the organization of the church spends no money helping it’s members.  
  
Not to mention that only higher up leadership get paid and the church does not pay for missions, which last two years, are required for men, and can include elderly couples. And guess who runs much of the church’s visitor centers, educational centers, etc?  Missionaries.",[],0

Day trading is short term trading where the things you mention dont really apply as much, its more about technical analysis. 

Then theres WSB, where you basically put all your chips on one single roulette number based on what some random retard says, aka gambling.

Any of these can be successful, some more than others. Its up to you to research which type appeals to you more, based on your goals and risk levels.

I understand you need to justify your job as a secretary at a mortgage brokerage. As rates rise the basis points taken per loan increase. Each loan has a higher profit, these companies then sell the same loan to a GSE or an investor. That investor sells to the wholesale market for a greater aggregate markup and bundles packages of mortgage loans. UWMC is literally a leading company and backed by the mortgage brokers association. Funny how “you work in the industry” both GSE’s face class action law suits. It means next to nothing, you are basically justifying a negative outlook on a stock on class actions that exist just to make a lawyer money.

you find a monkey in your pantry one morning, jamming fistfuls of sugar into its mouth and leering at you. You scream, it keeps eating sugar.

You step across the threshold of the door and it throws the sugar bag across the room, and bolts out the window laughing at you.

The next day, there's 3 monkeys. They all know the game, too. You scream, you shake the broom, you threaten to step in the room, but the second you step in, they wreck up the place and run away.

You board up the window, the monkeys pry it off. Things escalate until you start hiding your food elsewhere and propping the door to your pantry shut with a chair, until they start coming into the house.

Also, the notion that kids were distinct from adults in their capacity for reason was something else that was relatively new in the 20th century. Hence, you have 80 year olds fucking 15 year olds going through puberty. It was about as common as a Confederate's love for ass fucking their pigs because it was less dirty than being caught with a black person, which was clearly a win for states' rights and what the KKK spent 90 years conducting acts of domestic terrorism to protect.
