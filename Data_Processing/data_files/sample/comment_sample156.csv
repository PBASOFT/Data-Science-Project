Without pooling this is completely impractical but when pooling gets here this will be true. Atharium (you know the one) will ROI in around 120 days, possibly a LOT longer starting in July due to fees burning in EIP 1559. For this currency to ROI in 120 days, the network needs to 6-8x in size. That's assuming price of the currency doesn't change. If the network continues growing at the rate that it is, we may see all of this complete before this quarter is over. 

In summary, this is the most profitable currency until the network hits 50 exabytes, in which case it becomes the second most profitable UNLESS EIP 1559 hurts mining in which case it can remain the most profitable for much longer.

There are also cases to be made for the price to increase over time as well, but I'm assuming you know as much about it as I do and I can't really talk about it here without triggering automod.",[],0

What really, truly bothers me is that most meme stocks, even *squeeze meme* stocks, have a bullish case to be made. Not all are likely, but many are feasible.

They have either eliminated debt, or are in line for a huge contract, or have a recovery plan to help them shed COVID inertia.

But AMC doesn't. It's propped up by a bunch of Occupy Wall Street wannabes who want to eat the rich.

AFTER their board sold even more shares to give themselves over $8 million in bonuses for ""extraordinary efforts"" during the pandemic... this company still trades higher than almost ever, with more shares than ever, and their CEO will make another offering as soon as he thinks the company's image can take it.

Never denied that market consists of shitfuckery though. Trading halts not so much, system thats been around long enough for everyone not to be surprised, but the DTCC, brokerage actions and everything around it is some good information.

saved plenty of it, but as you said, all that is some big information around, but its links with GME share price ever going up is dubious to say the least. GME saga can both be over and it can also have exposed the truth. Just because it exposed the truth doesn't mean there is any squeeze left in the damn thing.

But if you ever find 140% shorted stock with turn around management again, that is where the shit is at, which we speculated the entire year 2020.",['GME'],1

ive done psychedelics since high school, almost every kind including research chemicals and studied the neurological / pharmaceutical effects, ive had maybe 100 trips, and agree that they could help, but long term they ultimately didn't do shit for me. mostly the day after or weeks after, then all good things faded and reality set back in.  
IMO anxiety and depression are a very touchy issue as it is very natural to the human condition.. and measuring it isnt easy as some people just have low tolerance to discomfort especially in this modern age of snow flakes, but life isnt always a comfortable thing...  
its really easy to say they are a revolution and make you feel good, WHEN YOURE HIGH ON THEM. they dont 'cure' anything IMO and are purely a novelty that could definitely aid with PTSD and therapy.  
from a financial perspective, im not convinced by this company yet that they can pull through and be highly profitable long term. Maybe they could get gov contracts or whatever that keeps them permanently afloat, but this isnt Cannabis.",[],1

No, it's used as the main contact point for computer parts, the entire socket interface of a CPU is either made of pure gold or electrum alloy that uses gold to prevent corrosion. The demand for gold will go up as the world becomes more reliant on computers. The counter argument against this of course is that it needs very little gold to ensure reliability so the demand is still low and cheap labor in india and china ensures that it is cheap to recycle computer parts for their gold/silver/copper making it a competitive source of reclamation vs mining new gold outright.

We can also argue that when the monetary system does collapse, gold will maintain it's value through the next system since demand will still be there assuming that our society further ""cyberizes"" in the new technological age (because gold/silver/copper is needed in technology). You can argue that silver can be used as a replacement for gold in many interface components since it does perform much better however silver does corrode where as gold does not and remains stable as long as it does not get exposed to amalgam agents like Gallium or Mercury so in solutions that require stable performance, gold cannot be replaced.",[],0

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

I then told her to buy gold, btw, which she would have made 20% on since then if she actually thought I knew anything.

I thought the same thing in 2006 and I’ll tell you why. My cousin got a huge loan for a house when her and her husband didn’t make all that much money. I thought that was weird and kinda crazy.

In 2000, I was taking an excel class in school where one of our projects was to pretend we had 10000 in the stock market. In two weeks, I made like 20% on these stupid internet stocks. I, knowing enough to know that I literally was just picking random stocks with no knowledge of anything whatsoever, thought that was weird too and asked my fellow classmate what to do if you think there’s going to be a crash.

I’m no Warren Buffett, but I think I can just sense this crap for some reason. At least the crashes. I couldn’t tell you what to buy in between the crashes, but I’ve sensed the three in my life.

I personally just feel we’re due for one and when it happens, the Fed won’t have as many tools to fix it after creating 5 trillion $ in the last year and having interest rates already at zero. What are they going to do? Create 5 trillion more and have negative interest rates on top of it?",[],0

In a rudimentary way, you described a synthetic position. The are two varieties; amazingly, long & short. No, they **ARE NOT** the same thing. You create a position without the need for an underlying and, in doing so, you get similar unlimited upside but the downside can be greater if the stock movers against you.  Most importantly, you do it **WITHOUT** the capital requirements of an actual position.

The long is buying ATM calls and selling an equal number of ATM puts of the same underlying stock and expiration date.  The reverse is true for the synthetic short - sell calls, buy puts.

Now, specific to $GME and the Hedgefucks...

A synthetic share is created by marrying ITM calls with a OTM put. How many ""fake"" shares do you need? Buy the calls to cover.  Oops, still need to get neutral.  Write however many puts it takes to do it. The calls are then exercised, creating ""fake"" shares and those are used to satisfy FTDs. The puts act a short pressure and end-up displacing SI.

You should look at $GME's graphs of ITM calls volume vs FTDs. EVERY TIME FTDs start piling up, 💥. When you're done with that, take a gander at Put OI vs SI%. Pay particular attention to January. Where did all the SI go? Yeah, OTM Puts.",['GME'],0

IMO it’s disingenuous to deny that the policy isn’t a de facto ban; at best, it’s a cruel double standard.

I’m baffled by your second assertion. Following their infamous pro-Proposition 8 involvement, when lay Mormons responded to Church leadership calls for its passage by contributing tens of millions of dollars to antigay propaganda, and the eventual legalization of gay marriage in 2015, the Church (IIRC) banned children of gay parents from full participation in its rituals unless they effectively cut ties with them.

To be honest, given its long history of aggressively antigay policies and political activism, not to mention high profile suicides and mass apostasies in protest, it takes a lot of chutzpah to claim the Church encourages compassion towards homosexuals.

I know it’s far from the only homophobic religion, some of which are exponentially more hostile. I also know many Mormons oppose their Church’s teachings. And as much as I loathe some of those teachings, I find others really admirable; Mormons are a model minority because of them.

Given how business goes I’m guessing that the backlog burn down is now being pushed into July.

2541,gyvgqj9,2021-05-20,t1_gyulzug,wallstreetbets,"Following the release of Endgame in April of 2019 hedge funds began increasing short sales on AMC, because the largest worldwide movie event in history just took place so there was no way that they would be able to match that success, it was the peak, in their eyes. (This is why when people say even prepandemic their numbers werent great, because they are citing a price that had already been shorted for a year.)

This short selling was a smart play to scoop up profits riding the price down but started to get excessive to the point that AMC started to become an undervalued company. Here is Adam talking about short sellers playing games with their stock price in November 2019 https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/11/07/amc-ceo-weve-been-victim-of-short-selling.html

So, short selling is getting a bit excessive despite good overall reports and riding profits from said largest cinematic event in history earlier in the year. Fast forward another 6 months and the pandemic hits.

The pandemic wasn't just a fundamental problem for thr movie going business, it was an opportunity for tunnel visioned greed to take over. Short sellers already deep in the game on AMC saw an opportunity to not only make profit riding the peak down, but to make a lot more money killing off the business. They increased their positions, new players got in the game because it was an obvious play, and they tried to drive the company out of business and pocket 100% of the profits.

AAs share offering kept the theater afloat and retail interest and love for movies came in to give the company a much needed lifeline, not just driving the stock price away from the brink, but regaining it's overall strength, catching short sellers off guard on their safe 100% profit play.

AMC is a good play for a couple reasons. 

First, simply because I, and many others, love going to the movies and do not want that part of our normal lives taken away for no good reason. The revenue that comes out of the theater profit model may need some updating, but I'd like to spend my money to give them time to adapt a new model and become stronger. The stock was also undervalued prepandemic due to short selling, and pent up excitement to get into theaters and watch new blockbuster films could bring revenues back up to Endgame levels when capacity is back to 100% before tapering off again. This is the non-squeeze fundamental reason it's a good play.

Second, the short sellers and financial morality reasons. Throughout the course of the above events more and more information has come to light. Visible market manipulation has unfolded before our eyes. Toxic trading has become a part of the public consciousness and an opportunity to correct some of the drastic wealth gap that actually doubled during the pandemic at the expense of the average person presented itself in the form of squeezing out the short sellers.  It won't fix everything, but the financial freedom of people willing to give back to their communities rather than hoarding more and more wealth by killing off businesses and putting people out of jobs is a good first step.",['AMC'],1

Hydrogen is \*already\* used to fuel transport. This is not a hypothetical, it's being done already, it works, it's viable. The Russians are investing heavily into it, as are BMW.

[https://www.greencarcongress.com/2020/02/20200202-asko.html](https://www.greencarcongress.com/2020/02/20200202-asko.html)

\> It's a total waste of resources

Water and electrical power? Hydrogen fuel is cheap as fuck to produce. You don't even need purified water.

\> barely any advantage at all

Aside from the zero CO2 emissions, being cheap to produce, and being light and easy to transport? As I've stated, renewable energy sources such as solar and wind have a particular problem with excess production at peak times. I've literally spoken with a wind turbine owner who can't sell the electricity due to a weak grid that can't take the load. As a result he has idle wind turbines. Hydrogen fuel production is his solution, it's cheap as hell to do, and electrolysis is an efficient process, unlike charging batteries.

This is not a hypothetical. Get off reddit, stop sucking Musks dick, get off ycombinator and all the other mainstream shit. Go talk to people in the real world who work in transportation, trucking, energy, whatever. Hydrogen production provides a solution to excess energy production, and that's not a small problem.",[],0

That's great dude, I never said otherwise. But far more people are buying Toyotas, far more people are buying BMWs, far more people are buying Audis, far more people are buying Fords.

Tesla are selling less than 2% of the cars sold in America. That's not unimpressive, they've beaten Nissan. But that absolutely does not justify a valuation that makes them worth more than all other car companies in the world, combined.

We hit the resistance at 416 but I don't think this is a problem. I think tomorrow could be flat with rotation plays and what not (energy will weigh it down). Monday we might test 410, and then head back for the ATH test like you said before. 

My main arguments right now are energy (Iran Deal and Israel ceasefire) oil will test March lows

Tech dip buying is over done, QQQ has been too strong compared to SPY. I think it will run out of steam. 

Commodities FUD around lumber, copper and steel needs to settle down, once market realises demand is still there regardless of inflation, this and also energy will carry SPY into June FOMC, which I think will be a non news event.

Jackson hole will be the taper announcement, so we will be back at SPY 400 but I do think we see 430-450 before we see 400.

Im not a fan of SPY puts, I do like VIX (not vxx etc) calls at the 25 strike when we settle at 15 or so (average in from 17)

3088,gyvi9zk,2021-05-20,t1_gyugvcd,wallstreetbets,"So I don’t agree at all, and I’ll tell you why:
First off, food and energy prices are in there, and with the exception of gas, lag very far behind the index as a whole. Gas on the other hand jumped way up this year, but otherwise hasn’t been particularly inflating over the last ten. Utilities in particular had something like 15% inflation over the last 10 years, and that accounts for half of most people’s energy expenses.

On the part about wages: I believe this chart shows an increasing drive towards assets, which implies that the greatest source of inflation in the last ten years comes from asset prices, not the weak wage growth and subsequent spending shown in the last chart. Moreover, if you look at a chart of productivity vs wage growth in the last 50 years, you’ll notice that estimated productivity continues to rise radically, while wages begin to flatline in the ‘70s. If what you’re saying is true, then we could expect to have extreme deflation over that period- fewer wage dollars are now chasing relatively more goods. But capital and rentier income has grown massively at the same time, offsetting that effect. 

The main place I’d argue you can see that effect in action is the difference between inflation in essential consumer goods, and in luxury goods and assets. Consumer goods have a really hard time inflating, while assets are free to explode. That’s because wages haven’t grown, so poor people have the same amount of money to spend as in the 70’s",[],1

This is called retained earnings and it gives the company the ability to compound their profits into more profits. An example: PUBM rolled out their CTV solution rapidly because they have the engineering resources to do it. They invest let's say 5 million of their previous profits into a CTV product (I have no idea how much that project cost). Once they cross sell the product to their customer base, they generate more revenue and therefore more profits.

\- One stock was tooling along at about $243 and change and suddenly it dropped 13% just for about 30 seconds and then came back to where it was.  
\- Another stock was sitting at $18 something and there was a bid out there for $8.75.  
What my smooth brain cannot comprehend is why these things were happening.   
\- Was I seeing a directed trade on the $243 stock at a discount?  
\- Was the $8.75 bid just someone hoping to pick up a bargain if someone dropped some stocks in at ""market price""?  
It took a while, but it got me thinking...can a retard like me use similar techniques, and what platform would make it possible?

3706,gyvkd90,2021-05-20,t1_gyvi9zk,wallstreetbets,"That's not an accurate depiction of core inflation. Having low real wages with increased productivity does not mean deflation at all. In fact it means growth and It means the fed can print money continuously and not suffer from massive inflation. 

Over the last 10 years interest rates have been very low. QE was used widely. But did we see inflation go up massively? 

The answer is no. Becuase real wages were not increasing but productivity was.

There's a reason why energy and food are stripped by the federal reserve when they look at core inflation. It's becuase it is very volatile and it can go up and down.

Real wages on the other hand are sticky and tend to stay up when they go up which has a bigger impact on long term inflation. 

When you look at energy costs going up 15% compared to real costs its effect isn't as significant.  Especially considering that energy price can tumble very quickly. Take last year in April...energy costs were less than they were 15 years ago.

For fed policy they want to look at inflation that will have a long term impact. That would be real wages. And as you correctly pointed out they have not been going up since the 1970s. Hence inflation has not been an issue for the last 30 or so years and the fed has been able to employ loose monetary policy.  

Since 2008 the fed has been pumping money into the economy. Don't you find it strange that now all of a sudden inflation is becoming a hot topic? The reasons are many like have extreme deflation last year when the global economy shut down but more importantly its the effect that workers right now are in demand and real wages might go up. This is what scares the fed. Not food or energy fluctuations. 

You need to look at this from a long term economic point of view and not short term blips.",[],0

If the inflation drives more total money to a company then that effect is removed. If it drives more money to the company than the inflation amount then it actually adds value to the company.

To your point though, inflation helps stocks when it’s the market that’s inflating. This would be huge injections of capital which you can see from the feds balance sheets, and wealth inequality because rich people just put their money in the stock market. So there’s been tons of inflation in the stock market over the years. There hasn’t been as much inflation in real goods though cuz I mean how many more groceries are rich people who are getting the majority of the money in the economy gonna buy? 

This inflation that’s happening now is not getting parked in stocks, it’s actually being spent on clothes, food, gas, used cars etc. When those real goods increase in price, the value of stocks decreases which is why market has been freaking out over inflation for past couple months",[],0

All good!

Its a similar scenario to the whole stock up on TP and Gas thing, the '08 PTSD. Everyone experiences it on some level.

Buying the poorest form of a product at its peak pricing and then using good money to fix it up while it depreciates.  

CC interest, Mortgage interest,  etc - wont end well for most.

Evan was very reassuring that shareholders of $UWMC would receive the correct rate, but data in app still doesn't match. Considering your size in the brokerage game, I hope that you realize how important it is that your data is accurate.

Google shows dividend yield 4.78%. Other brokerage showing the same amount within .03%. RH shows as less than 2% and has for some time. Been bugging me since about Q1. I've owned this company on another platform since SPAC merger.

Evan was very reassuring that shareholders of $UWMC would receive the correct rate, but data in app still doesn't match. Considering your size in the brokerage game, I hope that you realize how important it is that your data is accurate.

Google shows dividend yield 4.78%. Other brokerage showing the same amount within .03%. RH shows as less than 2% and has for some time. Been bugging me since about Q1. I've owned this company on another platform since SPAC merger.

VIX increases in value when put prices increases and when call prices decreases because that makes volatility increase. That's literally the formula. Put prices increases when there is more demand for them because people are fearful of future events and want to hedge their positions. Do you understand so far? 

On the opposite when everything's good in the market and nobody's fearful, put options are cheaper because most people aren't hedging they're position. You're still with me?

So when aggregate investors are fearful, put options price increase making its volatility increase. And then the VIX goes up.

I think I'm actually mentally broken. Like forever. 

While the whole world was burning in 2020 I had multiple golden tickets come my way that I basically threw away.

Got assigned SOXL at (post-split) $4...sold for $6...could have sold for $45 a year later. ZERO reason not to hold, but I sold.

Had BB $15Cs I bought way OTM before it went to $25. 2000% gain...just looked at it, then the next day it tanked. NO reason.

Made OK $ on GME and then managed to snag 7 $100C's for ~$10...sold 3 of them for ~$50 for no reason. Was *just* about to hit sell at $245 on 3/10 when the big red dildo fucked me. Literally a matter of seconds...my finger was pressing the button. That's after getting screwed during the first rug pull.

I've thrown away $200k+ in gains like this. I somehow still more than doubled my account, but the amount left on the table with retarded moves like these has **really** broken me.

I might be able to get over it if it wasn't for the ""once in a lifetime"" aspect. 

There won't be another COVID. Ever. There won't be another GME. Ever. I doubt I'll ever be so lucky to be in the right place at the right time again...even /r/wsb is now very different than how it was when I was fortunate enough to stumble on it at that unique moment in history.

I could have come out the other side of Armageddon a decade closer to retirement with an amazing story to tell, instead I'm just a mediocre coulda-been with crushing regrets I'll carry with me the *rest of my life*.

The problem is now I can't focus on anything. What's the point? I have 0 motivation for work or even finding a different job. Watching that much profit evaporate makes everything else seem fake and distant. If I fucked up such easy layups so cluelessly, what else am I fucking up in life? Do I even deserve to ""win""? I don't feel like I'm even entitled to any more luck again ever. I bitched and moaned my whole life, and when the universe relented and rained down tendies, I threw them away.

Anyway, Siri, play Everlong...",['GME'],1

That stock is now worth over $80. He basically pioneered the USLNG export market. He got pushed out from Cheniere by Icahn because he wanted to continue to expand, but Icahn just wanted a dividend paying stock. So Souki created a new company and took a bunch of people with him. LNG demand is going to far exceed supply over the next several decades. I’m not trying to be subtle in my love for LNG and I’m not trying to pump just for a simple trade. I am heavily invested in Tellurian because I believe in their prospects as a company. This stock has just as much, if not more potential than most all of the stocks on WSB in my opinion, yet you immediately dismiss it. Tellurian’s stock price will one day be higher than Cheniere’s. Charif Souki is out for blood. If you would like some real DD please let me know. We have a great community of Tellurian followers that have a wealth of information.",[],1

Welcome. Anybody who buys AMC and holds is able to jump on when we fly to the moon. Those dumb hedge funds are still shorting AMC. Last week on Friday, they attacked AMC trying to bring it down to $12 to win on their shorts. They failed and have to buy back those AMC shares on top of the ones they shorted in the past. They have not bought back any AMC shares and will continue to pay the interest on their shorts until they buy back all the AMC shares they shorted. The interest is slowly increasing and will eventually have to buy back the shares or pay the interest at a loss. Nobody can live off paying interest forever. Still holding onto my AMC shares.

I am sure it will run because people are fucking crazy, but the following is to keep in mind because correction will come, without a doubt, when common sense (ie fundamentals) kicks in:

Right before the pandemic was declared, they had 685M shares outstanding; the current number is at about 1,200M. Those shares were trading at $51.9 per share at its peak; today they closed at $27.53. That provides a market cap of $35.55B at the peak before the pandemic and $33.04B currently.

At the same time, long-term debt increased from $12.94B to $31.33B. Cash on hand as at Feb 28 was $11.51B, up from $9.51B. That provides the enterprise value of $38.98 before the hit and $52.86B currently. This is a very rough calculation and some numbers may be slightly different, but it isn’t far off.

So, while they lost $11.43B last year (and made about $3B the year before), market cap hasn’t significantly changed and enterprise value rose by a whooping $14B! Pretty sure everyone in their right mind understands that this is fucking insane.

This does not take into account that they will still be burning cash for the next few months, at least; and thus, issuing more shares or assuming more debt. Income prospects are also questionable for the foreseeable future for obvious reasons. For example, RCL’s CEO was talking about “favourable bookings” for 2022 (!). That was on the earnings call a couple of months ago (if I recall correctly).

Then add the green regulations that will come rather sooner than later since there were talks about it in not such a distant past and the current environmental concerns of the decision makers. That will require additional capital, which leads to more dilution and/or higher debt.

What I am saying is that it isn’t even remotely as bright as people are assuming it to be. Keep in mind that what I wrote above is really just the stuff on the surface and there is more shit to scratch. When the real market correction comes, cruise liners will be taking one of the biggest hits. When that correction comes is up for debate (not in the next few months, in my opinion, but I was wrong before). You should also keep in mind that they can dilute at any time and the last time they did was at the end of February; so we may be about due for another one, maybe not. Their next earnings call is on July 9, so that dilution may come before or right after, or not at all.

Let's say you bought a July 16, $3600 call for AMZN today at $22.3 and sold a $3550 call for $27.88. You pocket a net of $558 (12.6% of your margin requirement of $4442). If AMZN close above $3600 at expiry you lose the whole entry cost of $4442. Risk ratio is not so great. The only way you can make some money is by closing them on a big red day other than waiting for two months to make 12.6% with a hope that SP stays below $3550 at expiry. Even than the gain is tiny. If AMZN tank by $100 tomorrow you make may be $200 by closing both position. The opposite is also true though. 

I know it's all about the risk management but I do not like the spreads for some reason. If I see too much volatility but unsure of the direction then I would buy equal number of OTM calls and puts. If SP goes up too much I will lose 50% of my initial entry for puts but the calls might go 300% giving me a net 100% profit.",[],0

8672,gyvzqcp,2021-05-21,t3_kiypqq,wallstreetbets,"Bark is a great company and I think that some people don’t fully understand how strong their data-centric model is. In my opinion, they are more than a toy subscription company. Bark started selling toys, yes, but they’ve been doing so while also collecting as much data as possible from their customers. At the same time, they’ve always maintained a “high growth startup” mentality, as they are constantly launching new projects (failing fast and failing often). Some projects are small, like mobile apps and events, others are big like Super Chewer, Eats, Bright and Home. This matters because when you put a data-centric model and a culture for innovation together, you start to realize that what they are really building is a platform. One that targets all dogs regardless of their age (from puppy to senior) and one that owns every aspect of being a pet owner (play, nutrition, health, home). So, in the same way that today more than 50% of Amazon’s operating income comes from AWS, I believe that Bark is well positioned to find an AWS-equivalent business model, that will eventually represent a big chunk of their income. This could come from their newly launched business models, like Bark Eats in the food space, or maybe from new verticals that they haven’t explored yet, like dog insurance (market with tremendous opportunity in the US). There are obviously a lot of risks associated with this vision, but if they maintain their culture for innovation, I believe that they have a good chance to get there.",[],0

Then in 2020 and they had 255.3M in revenue, or a -24% growth rate. Yet the stock is WAY WAY WAY higher than before pandemic and before Pandemic their growth rate was practically 0%. Now it is negative. Even if Build a Bear would regain its entire 2019 revenue the fair value of the stock is before $5. Don't listen to the news outlets pushing reopening socks so they can dump these massive bags on you. The market has Build a Bear style stocks everywhere right now. Look at SEAS it is the same story and its fair value is under $20 based on pre-pandemic revenue.
