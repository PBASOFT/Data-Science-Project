\-Tesla true competition is not car OEM. Those will become commodities and not profitable. The true bread and butter here is HD map and spatial data. Tesla has some edge in this field, but not so much compared to Google/Apple/Alibaba. 

\-Elon does not use Lidar  and boycott HD map, because he makes a big bet on pure vision and he doesn't want to be a loser.

A hedge against an inflation can be a provider of some product/service that has low capex, ideally a moat of protection and can set pricing for its product/service.

Historically, gold has been a so-so hedge against inflation, it rose faster than the rate of inflation but only slightly and in the meanwhile equities exploded.

Also most commodity markets do not work in this naive simple way ""*more demand for metal X -> price of metal X will go up*"". Actually, the demand may go up and the price will go down. Demand for copper went up but the price went down for 15 years (and spiked only recently). Uranium now sells for less than it costs to produce and if demand increases, there is one state-owned producer which can scale easily and flood the market very quickly.

You won’t like this but none. 


> Like the Post says I have been steady acquiring Joann fabrics (JOAN) stocks because it is a pick and shovel stock. If you are unfamiliar with the topic, what that means is in a gold rush you don’t go digging for gold you sell the picks and shovels to dig gold. Tech stocks can be way overvalued, so instead of buying Etsy or EBay, one might buy JOAN because it sells to those who sell on those platforms. 



Yeah but people aren’t traveling 1000s of miles to buy yarn so they can knit socks and sell it on EBay. Most people sell used items on EBay anyway. 


Honestly I do not think this logic works in the stock market. It works at the local retail level or online retail level but not with stocks. Think back to where the term came from, the gold rush. People traveled thousands of miles to go mine gold and when they got to the west coast they had to buy equipment from the few people that sold them. Stuff was expensive in the west because stuff was scarce, and the people who came to the west had no other choice but to buy from the local shops in town. The pans they used cost them $8 or about $250 in today’s money. A pair of boots would go for $6 or about $185 today. Rice sold for $8 a pound or about $250 a pound today. As you can see the town shops in the west definitely had the upper hand back then. This being said, the cost of a pan didn’t go up in Virginia, it was only in the small mining towns. So it also takes into account regional aspects as well.

You can have the most succesful company in the entire world, if the stock is not being bought, then the price won't get up. Best example where this happened, just the other way around, is Tesla. It reached the 4th highest market cap on the S&P 500 without even having positive income (only due to government pay in the EV part). 

>I’m interested in investing into stocks but have no idea where to look at all or how it really operates.

Google. Sounds stupid, but informing yourself is step 0 on anything. Just listening to random people you don't know and don't know their level of understanding or expertise is the best way to lose 90% in the first 3 weeks.

>I’m willing to invest about 100-300 each paycheck to make money. End goal is to purchase a vehicle no more than 15K with a year’s worth of insurance and about 10K in the bank for extra or emergency expenses.

Is each paycheck monthly? I have no clue what a year of insurance costs, so I'll just guess 1k. 15k for the care and 10k as extra is a total of 26k. If you put in average 200 per month you can have that in roughly 11 years if you manage to not lose money. 25 years if you try to invest. Roughly 7 years if you just put your money into the S&P 500 and have good following years. 

>Will I be able to see such goals by the end of this year or will it certainly take time?

For sure. If you bump up the amount you put in to roughly 3k a month. That totals to 36k but I'll remove 10k just for the expected losses.

>I’m just very lost on where to even start

Youtube tutorials

>and how to even start a bank account

You what mate? I seriously hope you are talking about using your bank as a broker, because otherwise I will question how you even survived up until now. Online Brokers do not require a traditional bank account, nor a call. You sign up, put in money via a typical transfer (or paypal) and buy/sell whatever you want. Keep in mind you don't actually own the stock, unless you specifically request that (if the broker allows that), but that will cost you when you buy and sell. To avoid confusion, you own the value. The broker owns the shares.

That doesn't sound right. Market buys and sells are to be avoided because they _will_ fill, but at whatever price the broker can get or sell it for. Which means that you cannot predict what you'll pay or get, particularly for a volatile stock. If the nominal share price is 20, and there are 100 shares available with an ask of 20 and 50 with an ask of 25, a market buy for 150 will fill at 3250, not 3000. This is particularly risky if you're trading on margin as it can cause you to overextend.

The way each of these categories trades is very different. Metals such as gold or platinum are rare and can be seen as a storage of value. Most people are familiar with that idea. Energy is consumed and prices fluctuate. Prices for oil and gas tend to affect the price of everything else. Again, most people are familiar with the basic idea.

* IPO:  Thursday 5/20/21
* Price per share:  $15-17
* Shares:  84.4 million
* Estimated volume:  $1.35 billion (which probably aligns with the $10 billion valuation)

Again, who knows whether any of that is completely accurate, but the site is usually pretty reliable.

As for the company, I can see it doing well, over time.  If nothing else, Oprah is a backer, and that never seems to hurt the prospects of a business.  I would be surprised if it became an overnight sensation, but slow/steady growth seems reasonable, given the trajectory of plant-based products.  Full disclosure:  I have had a plant-based diet for 9 years, so I am bullish on the concept.  However, I agree with prior commentary here about the valuation seeming somewhat bloated.

In that same space, there is a company called SunOpta ($STKL).  They are a large producer of soy/almond/oat milks.  Some products are delivered under their own labels; others are created for private labels (i.e., they make the stuff that CostCo sells under its ""Kirkland"" brand).  Currently, SunOpta has a $1.33 billion market cap.  So, there might be more room to run, when contrasted with a $10 billion valuation.  Plus, SunOpta appears to have some diversified revenue streams, which can be a nice feature.  

That all being said, I don't hold any position in the company, so I'm not super knowledgeable about any granular details, and you should definitely look into it yourself.  Nevertheless, I wanted to pass along this limited information, in case it was helpful to the discussion.",[],1
