Consider this, If you banned all forms of shorting, how would you expect to make money in a bear market?

You want to throw the short-baby out with the market-bathwater.  Because you don't understand it's role in the market lifecycle.

It's with hedgefucks playing fast and loose with regulations and developing techniques that skirt the spirit (if not the letter) of regulations.

The current maximum tax credit is $7,500 with no maximum price and currently phases out for individual automakers once they hit 200,000 total EVs sold.

Both General Motors and Tesla have hit the cap and currently do not qualify for the $7,500 tax credit.

The ‚ÄúClean Energy for America‚Äù bill, which advanced on a 14-14 tie vote, would eliminate the existing EV cap, while the credit would phase-out over three years once 50% of U.S. passenger vehicle sales were EVs. It has numerous other green energy tax incentives and would rescind or cut many fossil fuel tax provisions.

The EV proposal led by Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, would boost the $7,500 tax credit by $2,500 for vehicles assembled in the United States and another $2,500 for cars at facilities whose production workers are members of, or represented by, a labor union.

- BB attempted this transition to Cyber Security years ago, again nothing new about it. I use their software on a daily basis and it is shit and clunky. Cisco easily outmatches it. BB is the budget ""because we need it for compliance"" software.

- IVY is a heavily overstated platform. Nobody cares about half of the data it collects. Vehicle manufactures can easily collect this data for themselves if it was useful. The physics of driving is a pretty straightforward concept.

you didn't but you should because you did that thing where you act like only direct inheritance counts, you fucking clown. it's access to capital, social or direct, that vastly improves given one's status at birth. maybe their parents paid for ivy league schools, is that an ""inheritance""? maybe their parent's spoke well of them at their venture capital meeting. maybe their last name means they have 500 thousand instagram followers just for taking two selfies a day.

you're a fuckin clown that looks to have drowned in the ayn rand kool-aid so at the end of the day i'm wasting my time, but your little article is also ""trust us we did the research"" on a right wing rag. i'll say it again to really drive it home, you're a fucking clown. your comment right here makes you look like a fucking clown to anyone with a brain.

This follows a pretty quiet day on Wall Street, with some muted gains. Disappointing earnings from Nvidia and Snowflake after the bell appear to be weighing on sentiment now, especially for tech stocks. This is preventing a breakout.

Bunch of economic data releases this morning that people will be watching in anticipation of a Fed adjustment to interest rate policy.

These all drop at 0830: Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) prices are the Fed‚Äôs preferred gauge of inflation. Core prices are expected to have increased by 2.3% in Q1, the same as in Q4. If that number beats the upside then watch out for inflation and tapering talk. 

Durable goods orders should shed some light on supply chain constraints as well as demand from manufacturers. Expectations are for 0.8% print for core orders, down from the 2.3% level in March. 

It‚Äôs Thursday, so we also get initial jobless claims. Economists are expecting another post-pandemic low there, of 425k. That‚Äôs a slight drop from 444k reported last week. 

There‚Äôs also a GDP print, but I don‚Äôt care about that as it‚Äôs entirely backward looking and has no impact on future direction of pretty much anything.

We also have pending home sales at 1000. Expectations there are for 0.8% increase, down from 1.9% in March.

Selling stocks at a loss that then go past your buy price, or selling stocks after they raise only for them to go far higher is part of the game. Don't regret or dwell on these trades. It's important to look at the bigger, longer picture. As long as you win more than you lose, you are winning. 

There is a lot of money to be made. If you can achieve consistent results, keep at it and don't start doing weird risky bullshit.

Personally I've traded on and off for about 10 years(crypto initially) and these days I increase my portfolio 10%-15%~ or so each month. Its nothing crazy like DFV, but I know if I just keep humming away and ignoring what I could currently do with that money, it'll be several million before I'm 35.

Cramer has a decent idea how bad Citadel and other hedge funds are in the hole on GME and AMC. He also knows that they are not only not closing out their positions, but continuing to short GME and AMC. 

He‚Äôs also smart enough to have a rough idea of how the tumbling of the house of cards can topple the entire economy. In fact, he likely knows that they‚Äôre counting on the federal government to intervene before that happens, much like 2008.

But once you're going, I would say it's about 2/3 the price of traditional construction if you know what you're doing and can meet demand properly. I also find that most clients want customization so very few have wanted set models unless we're dealing with for example a trailer park or resort developer. With customization comes extra costs and lots of upgrading on the client side. You're limited to specific ceiling heights and modules because the labour it takes to say cut out an an entire side is very expensive and time consuming. We're still learning as we go along. Thankfully we have a primary business that's related so we have resources to fall back on. It's probably way cheaper in place with less regulations like the US. But we don't want to build units that can potentially kill someone in the long-term or grow mold cuz it's not ventilated properly etc. I see so many DIYers and it's great until your window starts sagging because you haven't correctly engineered it for the weight and property of the steel. We definitely have moved onto steel framed modular houses. You can build whatever you want and have cathedral ceilings. Still have limitations due to shipping logistics and costs (width of modules.

Market Cap: 550mil
Q1 revenue: 265mil
Q1 income: 6mill (compared to -111mil Q1 2020)
Cash on hand: 401mill

So historically Kodak has been on a loosing streak. But recently they have made the right moves the cut the fat, start generating profits while also strengthening their balance sheet with new investment.

Kodak has a few product lines, printers inks etc. While these generate most of Kodaks income they are also fairly stable. What is less known is kodaks history with advanced chemicals manufacturing and I expect this is where future growth will reside. 

So as it stands they are trading at 0.5x revs with almost their entire market cap in cash and making profit. That seems like a deep value play and gives them plenty of runway for growth.

8931,gzmsmky,2021-05-27,t1_gzmrc6j,wallstreetbets,"It's whatever you need to believe it is to make the ISS work, that's the whole point of a cult. You're also moving the goalposts significantly from ""retail buys and holds 100% of AMC shares"" to a new ""they're hiding the shorts in the dark!"" Argument.

That sort of shifting avoidance of counter arguments is a hallmark strategy to avoid cognitive dissonance in an illogical position. 

AMC is so high because large institutional buyers created hype that caused trained retail cultists to believe an impossible outcome is imminent. As a result, the FOMO leads to retail funneling enormous amounts of money into sellers (who do you think people are giving $19/share to?), Who both sell impossible covered calls at huge premiums, and later let the asset slide 50% in value, booking massive profits.
