65,2021-05-25,investing,">Or to buy a bag of dying companies because those are ""dumb"" indexes; there's no DCF or analysis to make up its contents just vanilla price and earnings ratios leaving you with the companies whose cash-flow is poorly valued by the market. I find it insane to group up all companies below X PE and call it value investing, if you don't wish to do the picking you can buy shares of funds managed in the spirit of value investing.

Value indexes usually use more metrics like price to book, dividend yield, etc. It's not just raw P/E, or something as simple as a company doing a required goodwill impairment causing negative GAAP earnings in one quarter would kick them off the index.

It's not the smartest indexing, but in general value investing has outperformed the SP500 historically.

Value doesn't necessarily mean dying. If you look at the top 10 holdings of VTV, for example, the only one you might be able to call ""dying"" would be Exxon Mobil, but that's if you're genuinely convinced that we're going to transition away from oil as a society in the near future. They could also have a lot of upside of oil prices keep rising.

Really I'm only into value since late last year. Once growth actually corrects to be reasonably priced again, I'll start putting new money into the overall market. But I'm not seeing that yet.",gzfipk5,t1_gzfi0n6,[],0

114,2021-05-25,investing,"Pure speculation on my part that it's related to Merrill Edge's revenue model.

Many brokers generate a lot of their revenue from net interest income. Some brokers also generate income from payment for order flow (pfof). Merrill Edge is one of the brokers that doesn't  sell order flow although they get rebates from exchanges and they may make a market as well. And there are other revenue areas as well. 

ETFs can pay a distribution fee - similar in concept to 12b-1 fees for mutual funds. To reduce fees, I recall reading that ETFs may have been reducing their fees to brokers - at least I don't see those expenses listed on ETFs.

So perhaps, Merrill Edge prefers to offer the mutual fund equivalents which offer a 12b-1 fee instead of the actively managed ETF.

I took a look at $ntsx and some of the Avantis ETFs that you mentioned. They are low volume and low net asset so blocking these funds really would have little to no impact to Merrill.

Of course - that's just a wild guess. It could be an entirely different reason. For example - I did a search on blocked ETFs on Merrill Edge. The one thing that I noticed was that blocked ETFs tended to be low net asset active ETFs regardless of the fund family or asset class - so that kinda kills my idea that it could be revenue related since I'm guessing that ETFs in the same fund family probably costs the same to process and generate similar revenue.

I’m not saying OP of this comment thread is trying to do that, just that that is a common theme when people trot out those kinds of statistics.

There are many MANY factors that affect the wealth accumulation of individuals. One’s gumption and work ethic compared to the average person is probably relatively low on that list. There are many factors that amount to nothing but good luck. Of course, luck isn’t the only factor. Like I said, it gets complicated.

134,2021-05-25,investing,"Value investing is about present and projected cashflow in relation to price, looking for those that are mispriced. Value indexing is made from picking companies at the opposite ends of a classification based on a handful of metrics. [Here's](http://www.crsp.org/files/Equity-Indexes-Methodology-Guide_0.pdf#page=37) how they make the underlying index to VTV, basically put stocks on a scale of PE/PB/PS/div ratios for value, future and historic growth/ROA for growth and chop the middle. Sure, Exxon gets in that package and I'm sure a great many companies, but I'm not sure there is denying that it will also include the low/no-growth companies that the market values poorly. Going for something as simple as <X PB worked in the time of Graham, but we are no longer in those times and throwing in a few more metrics and a cute multi-parameter model to automate the process (or even better, a Monte Carlo simulation [^TM](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/), but I digress) doesn't solve the issue of such an oversimplification.

I'm not saying that I necessarily see them as baskets of dead companies (although it is written like that), I just don't see how indexing accomplishes the same role as value investing. I'm sure there is plenty of correlation between the aggregate performance of both since the latter are more likely to converge on stocks within those bounds then the one set for growth indexes, but I'd be shocked if any value investor would be interested in buying everything in that band (tho I'd be curious to hear if there is, as long as it's not the guy giving a Google Talk on his atrociously performing fund using a low-CAPE strategy based on theory and access to OPM). Besides, the orthogonality set by those ETF-sellers between value and growth is a bit funny and seemingly [irreconcilable with the philosophy](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1992.html) (CTRL-F to ""fuzzy thinking""), but I guess selling ""low-growth"" ETFs has less of a ring to it... and who doesn't want to make a 0.04% commission on capital from an automated process (nonetheless, bless Vanguard and Mr. Bogle, of course).

>value investing has outperformed the SP500 historically

Perhaps, so how do you reconcile that with the under performance of value indexes? Sure a bull-market is not the best playground for value investors, but VV slaughtered VTV on all accounts and there's a gaping bear market in the middle of their history. VTV had a slightly worse drawdawn in '08 and a slower recovery thereafter. The only over performance I see from VTV is in the ramp up from 2004 to 2008. If you do this exercise with BRK and SPY, you'll find BRK under-performed in 2002-08 and over-performed for the drawdawn and recovery (as you'd expect per Buffett's own but ancient letters).",gzfqrow,t1_gzfipk5,[],1
135,2021-05-25,investing,"Hi all, I have some basic questions and appreciate if you can provide some insights:

1. The value at which an ETF is trading, is it the sum of the share's market value divided by the number of ETF shares? If not, should it be?
2. Do ETF issuers usually post news to changes that they make to the constituents of the ETF? For example, an accumulating ETF reinvests. It would be nice for this to be announced as opposed to me keeping track of the data that can be obtained from the issuer's website.
3. I'm having trouble understanding the fundamental concept of the value a stock has. When you buy a stock you own a small part of the company. Assuming you're long the stock, you expect the company to grow and profit from that. However, when the company grows you don't actually share in the growth, since you don't share the companies profit. The only thing you (can) get is dividends, which is a fraction of the share's value. Alternatively you sell the share at the current (higher) value to someone else, but given what I said above, the higher value of the stock doesn't directly net you more significant more returns, so why is the value of the stock higher in the first place? I feel like I'm missing something here.",gzfqvkz,t3_nkl62k,[],0

The idea is that prices are somewhat dictated by analysts that look at these details, and you're just buying market cap weights of companies that fit the value criteria.

What going with value indexes instead of overall market cap weighted funds is avoiding overhyped growth stocks.

IMO in the current market where you have unprofitable companies like Coinbase and RBLX trading at 50x revenues, value is a good way to avoid much of the overvalued hype. If you invested in value before the tech bubble crash, you wouldn't have even lost money while the NASDAQ dropped 75%.

The problem is growth is at some point the growth is priced in, perhaps a little too much. If growth companies don't grow as fast as anticipated, they can lose a lot of value.

I actually do VYM and VIG for my taxable brokerage. Both provide me some income I can either reinvest or spend. VYM is usually oriented towards large cap value. VIG is more of a blend, but it's criteria of rising dividends gives exposure to growing companies that actually target profitability like Microsoft and Visa, rather than growth at all cost stocks like Tesla.

It's easy to save and/or invest money when you have money to save/invest. Meaning, no debt to service.

Imagine how much cash one would have if they didn't have to:

- Pay Student Loans.
- Pay a car payment.
- Pay Rent/Mortgage because you inherited a home or live in a parent's extra home. Bonus if you collect rent from roomates and use it to supplement your income (seen this happen several times).
- Pay high interest credit card debt (credit cards are use for points and convenience, not as a cash buffer between checks)

Then there are little things that add up:

- Paying cash for phones instead of getting the ""free"" phone when you sign a contract.
- Great advice from day-1 from parents about finances. This is invaluable. Many of us learn financial literacy the hard way.
- Lower interest rates on everything because all of the above usually results in better credit rating.

However, you must note that my point was you did not actually refute Cathy’s points or approach AGAIN. The appeal to your personal authority demonstrates the absence of something to refute it other then (potentially valid) comments against Cathy’s character. 

Paul Graham has an essay / model on the hierarchy of the quality of disagreements that might be worth referencing. https://bennorton.com/grahams-hierarchy-of-disagreement-and-internet-arguments/ 

Fundamentally, my comprehension is Cathy is trying to take a venture backed model (a portfolio of ‘early stage’, publicly listed firms) with an ETF as a wrapper, in fields where technology implies magnitude stepwise changes that have not been appropriately priced into the market. I’d be curious what sectors you hold, if you are purely limited to public equities/securities and how your approach fairs in this next business cycle.

211,2021-05-25,investing,">Right now it seems like the price of the stock is tied at the hip to the price of Bitcoin. But based on what I've seen they shouldn't be. The more people that are buying and selling, the better it is for Coinbase..... its all about volume. I would think volatility in the crypto market would actually be a boon to these guys, because you will get the paper handed folks selling and the long-term hold folks buying the dip.

Volume is positively correlated with price over time. Sure, you'll have massive volumes on huge dump days, but in a multi-year bear market, volumes shrink significantly. Bear markets end when there are essentially no more sellers any more. If you're going to own COIN, I think you have to gain comfort with the fact that their revenues/profits are very much tied to the cycles of the crypto space.

As a side note, Coinbase needs to beef up their systems to handle the high-volume days better. They could've earned more fees from me, but their site crashed on May 12 so I was unable to buy the dip until the BTC price had already rallied 11K from the bottom.

226,2021-05-25,investing,"it might be a bit late to answer you but I still believe the trade makes sense, even at this price. I am holding LTMAQ since july 2020. What equity investors might be not seeing is that LTMAQ is under chapter 11 and its bonds are in default, still the sr unsec ones are trading around 95% of par. So, the laws in Chile and in the whole Latin America is way different that US bankruptcy laws. Last week I saw one news comparing LATAM Airlines situation as the new HERTZ where equity jumped from 1 to 6 usd once they restructured the company. The price action can be similar but the reasons will be different. There is now way that shareholders will loose its company to unsecured creditors, not in any Emerging Market country. So, if bonds are trading close to 100% of its par, why the equity is still between 25 - 30% of pre covid levels? Probably they will swap this debt into some convertible bond which in the end you might get diluted as an equity holder, but still I would assume at least 5 usd for this stock even in the event of a dilution, because we will be talking about a leader company in the region well positioned for the recovery and free of debt.

The point is when you make strategies based on economic theory and what should be happening ur very prone to blowing up. In theory implied volatility is regularly higher than realized volatility but shorting volatility has a grave yard of people in it. Funds like Renaissance and DE Shaw run strategies that are much shorter term and thus more statistically significant and they also exercise world class risk management and are hyper aware of assumptions they make when they have models that last longer time frames.

In addition to this, I'm adding about $25k cash to the account as a jump-start in long-term index funds. I am not trying to win the lotto or play games with Crypto/GME. I just don't want to live off Social Security when I'm 67. I'm self-employed so my income comes and goes in waves, but my realistic goal is to contribute 15-20% of my gross annually for the next 35-ish years.  
  
Upon research, VTSAX seems to be the golden boy for the long game, but VTI has a .01% lower fee to it, and doesn't have the $3000 minimum purchase. Considering they're effectively the same, it seems like I should just put everything in VTI, right? Or do I buy VTI until it grows to $3000 and transfer it to VTSAX?",gzg4vnl,t3_nkl62k,[],0

Why buy or rent a calculator for several hundred when there are incredibly cheap or even free online alternatives.

2 Daily ETF holdings are public so you can check for changes youself, or even script it. I hear ARK sends emails about their trades. Maybe others do as well but I don't think it's common. Or you can check if their underlying index provider has an email service. I'm not sure what the point of announcing a non-change like reinvesting dividends in an accumulating fund would be.  

3 You own the company and when the company grows, you do share in the profit. You don't have a majority say in how that profit is used, only a minority share.  

For some mature stocks which aren't able to grow as much and don't do buybacks, the dividend is often going to be the main form of returns. But generally a company's earnings can also be allocated for shareholder benefit in other ways. You may find it helpful to see a stock as an unsellable stake in a tangible small business. You benefit when the company pays you explicitly and you may benefit more when the business retains some earnings to grow and be able to pay you more in the future. In some cases you may need to invest more capital into the business for several years before it can start to pay off.   

Then add on the ability to sell that stake to others when you need cash now in a liquid market to others who don't. The stock price is not just a mirror of the business in its current state; it is the expected future cashflows of the business discounted to present value at a rate that depends on how much the marginal buyers and sellers prefer money now vs more later and how much risk they are willing to take.

My spouse and I are in our mid 40s. We sold a piece of real estate and are wondering where we will get the best results: pay off a big chunk of our mortgage and take years off the loan and save tons on interest or invest it hoping for bigger payout over time? The stock market is increasingly volatile which could mean great returns(and risks). We do not need the money for another 15 years, but want it to work for us in the meantime. We already have a decent retirement spread over a 401K, and a diverse, though USA, stock portfolio.

In general, QE has minimal impact on inflation and requires private banks to make loans (something they're not doing alot of today).

I'm also not sure how government liabilities impact inflation.  In my mind this is deflationary.

If you're worried about inflation PPP loans and fiscial spend are the only policies of concern.

Back to your question. I see no catalyst for long term inflation.  In the short term, will see price hikes, attributed to the reopening, but the forces of demographics, technology, globalization will keep inflation down, as it has since the 70s.

FAQ

**What does this mean?**

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

**Why did you do this?**

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

Rudeness towards other Redditors,

Spreading incorrect information,

Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

**Am I banned from the Reddit?**

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

**I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?**

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

**How can I prevent this from happening in the future?**

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",gzgimx5,t1_gxy1ika,[],0

475,2021-05-26,investing,"So, I've been commenting on a lot of VG threads trying to get people to avoid throwing money away or at least try to do the math around the numbers, but have mostly failed. So I'm a huge VG bear and I have high conviction that they will go bankrupt or liquidate or sell for peanuts, but here are some possibilities:

* If you look on their website, they clearly state that 250k was for early birds and if you sign up for waitlist, you most likely won't get that price. So 1.5 mil is a lower bound on revenue per flight.
* They have 2 spaceships (Unity -- tested and Imagine -- untested) and have 2 more under construction. Burt Rutan's Xprize winner was able to relaunch in 2 weeks, it is plausible that 2 space ships can do 50 launches a year after they get the kinks out and 4 space ships can do 100 launches. Maybe more. I personally would be concerned about market size if they can get to that cadence. 100 launches per year at 2 million revenue per flight is 200 million per year. Not enough to justify current valuation and still not profitable -- especially considering that many launches will add to costs. They'll have to launch a lot more often or somehow cut costs or charge a lot more.
* Their long term pivot business plan is point to point hypersonic transit. Good luck with that. They do have an advantage with their mothership-spaceship model in that they can launch from a population center without causing sonic boom issues in populated areas -- something Starship point-to-point has an issue with. Starship has to kludge it by saying there is going to be a transfer to an offshore platform. The problem with the mothership-spaceship model is it doesn't scale to larger ships and to get good margin, you need more passengers. Look at Stratolaunch and the size of that mothership -- largest plane in the world, it can't carry that big of a rocket -- no way of sending > 100 people at a time.",gzgjhqg,t3_nl3ne2,[],0

Space tourism will certainly be a thing (there are already companies planning on having hotels in orbit), but most of the available 'rewards' \~right\~now\~ are the kind governments and state agencies usually reach for.  Pieces of the space travel vertical may be profitable, since the US government is leaning heavily on private companies for launch vehicles and lunar landers, but as far as products go, there really isn't much out there right now.

Eventually someone will put furnaces on the moon and convert lunar regolith into building blocks and they'll make something with them.  Other firms will setup refueling stations in orbit around Earth and the Moon, and if Elon is to be trusted, there'll be people on Mars in our lifetime.  It's all exploratory.

574,2021-05-26,investing,"Inflation! Everyone has an opinion, but no one will know who was right until its all over!

So I'll throw my opinion in as well.

To my knowledge, hyperinflation has not been seen in the United States since the Civil War, and then only on the Confederate side. See definition of hyper inflation: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hyperinflation.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hyperinflation.asp)

So I feel comfortable saying that we will not see hyperinflation in the U.S. at any time in our lives.

High inflation is of course quite possible and has occurred numerous times in U.S. history, but even in the oft referenced 70s, inflation peaked at around 13%, which, while uncomfortable, was hardly ruinous.

Right now the FED wants to see at least 2% inflation YOY. So a single quarter isn't going to be sufficient to trigger a FED response. Additionally the most recent report was heavily skewed towards a few items, like used cars. So I'm thinking we aren't really in trouble yet.

Many point to large increases in commodities prices. Quite understandable, but keep in mind that we basically shut down the economy last year. Commodity inventories drew down to extremely low levels. So now that we are reopening, commodities are suddenly in demand and it will take time to refill inventories. Simple supply/demand explanation for commodity price increases. High prices will be its own solution for commodities as commodity producers will switch into oversupply mode trying to take advantage of the price increases, which will in turn drive the prices right back down.

I do feel that wage increases pose an actual permanent inflation risk as the current worker shortage does seem to be raising wages across the board. Wages tend not to come back down once they go up. But even this is likely to be a one time bump that filters through the economy and modestly increases prices generally and then settles back down. It isn't likely that companies will keep raising wages unless they absolutely have to.

So expect some real but modest permanent inflation along with a lot of transitory inflation.",gzgt5g0,t3_nkveh8,[],1
575,2021-05-26,investing,"My point is that the government is already invested in the economy without having to actually own stock. Stock entails rights to earnings and to management of the company. Through taxation and regulatory legislation, government can exert those rights without holding shares. Companies pay a percentage of their earnings to the government in the form of taxes in much the same way they may pay out some of their earnings to shareholders as dividends. If government wants to give companies access to more capital, then it doesn't have to buy stock or bonds, but can instead give tax breaks, subsidies, and loans. In no case does the Treasury actually have to interact with the stock market to get the benefits that are involved with investing in companies the way we would as citizens. The question of whether tax rates, tax breaks, and subsidies are properly allocated is in the realm of politics, but the basic idea is that the government is always investing in the US economy and always collecting its cut of the profits.",gzgt5jj,t1_gzewexz,[],0

589,2021-05-26,investing,"[Wendover Productions actually published a video on this topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4p0fRlCHYyg) quite recently. Some takeaways:

- It's likely that the Concorde actually was profitable, but it was very inflexible (only a few possible routes), aging (so would need replacement soon), and perhaps not as profitable as subsonic flights.
- There are several firms developing new supersonic aircraft. One innovation may significantly reduce the loudness of the sonic boom, which may allow those planes to operate over land and open up far more possible routes.
- The value-proposition of supersonic flight is more questionable nowadays. Planes have internet access which allow business travelers to do some work while in-transit (so it's not completely dead time). And travelers may prefer spending extra time in a subsonic business class with comfortable lay-down seats versus a shorter amount of time in less comfortable seats that we'd probably see in supersonic jets.
- Still there may be a small niche of commercial travelers who are very time-sensitive and would prefer a supersonic flight. There may also be a small market of ultra-wealthy individuals who may want to buy a supersonic private jet.

Overall my takeaway is that there may be a real if small market for supersonic travel, but Virgin Galactic is poorly positioned to take advantage of this. Its competitors have been focused exclusively on developing supersonic aircraft for the last two decades or so, and it's still going to be another decade or so until they expect to start delivering planes. Even if Virgin Galactic was positioned the same as its competitors, you're essentially speculating on a company that's a decade away from launch.

My suggestion would be to first talk to your boss/company and see if there is a path for you to start branching into the investment side.

I have 3 remaining hurdles to leap through in order to make that conclusion: 

1. **To understand if Unity Engine can compete in the non-gaming segments**
   1. Question 1: with that many specialized competitors, what's the edge of Unity? live 3D simulation? that's it? or is there more?
   2. Question 2: Using Bentley as an example, how would Unity be able to penetrate into this market, as competitors have such specialized knowledge? 
2. **To understand if Unity ads business could thrive in that competitive space**
   1. Question 3: With Facebook and Google as market leader plus Apple's policy change, how well would Unity ads do?
3. **To compare if Unity's engine-operations-ads business model works better than Epic's engine-developer-publisher model**
   1. Question 4: would Unity's offering on game-ops solution be more helpful to game dev than Epic would? In other words, would Unity's solutions capture more game dev's challenge than Epic would? Note that I am referring to the entire business model, not just the engine itself

You arn't putting up any asset to collateralize the loan they give you. Your income now depends on a business doing well (future revenue) which you are no longer part of and have no control over.

The correct way for you to get cash wash to have the seller get a loan from a bank for the purchase of your company and to have them pay you cash.

You can look into factoring or something of the like..but you don't even have ""accounts receivable"" to lend against..you sold those.

Can you take out more on your mortgage? Home equity line of credit? (Since you'll now have more cash inflow ..hopefully...to pay something like that off?). Can you secure a bank loan with stocks or brokerage funds?

This, in my opinion, is not a good situation. Even if a bank believes your future company will make profits (and you will in turn receive profits)...they would want you to have eggs in that basket (ownership) before they put their eggs in that basket with a loan against that.

Of all the FAAMG’s I’m most bullish on Amazon followed by Microsoft over the long run (long on Seattle area haha). Over the long run you need to go with culture - as been said before on this forum, the rest of these businesses have golden eggs (Instagram, Windows, iPhone, Search, YouTube, etc.) - I think Amazon is the only one with a Golden Goose. Brutal but effective internal culture leads to accurate and rapid decision-making (recommend Brad Stone’s books if want to learn more). They have a deep bench so I think they’ll continue to do well in the Jassy era and will have Jeff watching over from the board. As far as Google, Facebook, and Apple are concerned (most of which I own) - these really haven’t come out with a new/innovative product in over a decade.

1. How many stocks is enough to be adequately diversified as the portfolio grows? I feel i could cut down to under 20 stocks and concentrate in my top holdings.

Investopedia is a great beginner's resource to look up different terms and the basics of the licenses. FINRA's website will also be a good place to go for a more in depth look at what the licenses test on.

One important thing to note is that you cannot take the 7 or 66 on your own, you have to be sponsored by a FINRA registered member firm.

I either reduce the position back to 5% (take the wins and still hold onto a majority of the shares in the long term), or if I have enough capital to invest in underperformers (Which if I still have conviction in, means they are on sale), I'll increase positions there to get my asset allocation back in line - which is preferred so I don't have to sell anything for tax purposes and typically an ongoing process throughout the year.",gzhd1wn,t3_nl6zd6,[],1

Safe and affordable in this industry takes years to decades. Space flight as it stands now has lower safety factors than commercial aviation. Furthermore the cost of bringing a single kilogram to low earth orbit the last I checked was over $10k. 

Commercializing space travel and letting private citizens fly means regulations will increase in that sector (if there even are any to begin with since this is all basically uncharted territory). Regulations (while a good thing in aerospace) mean costs go up and profits go down.

It also burns solid fuel which breaks down into far more harmful elements than what the Virgin plane uses, a plane that launches from 60,000 feet, burns for only 60 seconds and weighs what I can only imagine is a tiny fraction of the shuttle’s weight.

On the flip side plans flying out of LAX alone create 800,000 tons of co2 emissions per month.

So again, quite a few orders of magnitude different. A fraction of a fraction of a fraction added to global emissions. Not a, “massive impact.”

901,2021-05-26,investing,"The most a triple leveraged (index) fund can drop in one day is 60%, since trading will be halted for the day after a 20% drop in the index. With daily rebalancing, the following day you can again only lose, at most, 60% of the remaining value before trading halts. The means on day 1 your portfolio will be worth 40% of the day before; day 2, 16%; day 3, 6.4%; and so on.

If you’re buying a leveraged index ETF, you don’t need to worry about it going to 0. There will be daily rebalancing, and reverse splits, that prevent that from occurring.

That being said, there is very high risk with these ETFs. I like to imagine it as being (3x) long the index, while also being short (non-leveraged) volatility. If volatility spikes while prices increase, the ETF value will increase, since the 3x long “outweighs” the 1x “short volatility”. If volatility spikes while price remains constant or decreases, you lose money from both your 3x long and 1x “short volatility” position. This of course isn’t perfectly accurate and mainly just an approximation, but it helps get the point across, to me at least.

So, think of it this way: would you hold a position that is 3x long QQQ or SPY, and 1x short VIX? If not, don’t hold TQQQ or UPRO without a hedge. There’s been lots of discussion on various forums about viable strategies to hold 3x leveraged funds, and being long bonds as 40-60% of your portfolio with the remainder dedicated to 3x leveraged funds seems to be the most stable over time. There’s still risk involved of course.

If you’re planning on going all-in on 3x leveraged ETFs, be prepared to lose 60% of your portfolio every day during a black swan event. If that is an acceptable risk and you’re bullish on the index, then take it. If not, consider a small position and/or hedging the position with appropriate products (long volatility with rebalancing? bonds? metals? many possibilities here).

The key with these leveraged ETFs, from my experience, is timing the market. Everyone who has failed will tell you it’s impossible, and everyone who has succeeded will tell you that you just need to pay attention to the right things. Personally, I think it’s all bullshit and they got lucky, but to each their own. If you’re going to hold leveraged ETFs, be prepared to sell on the slightest hint of a bad time, and at the very least set up stop loss orders to minimize your suffering in the event of a crash. 

Disclaimer: currently long TQQQ and UPRO as a not-insignificant portion of my portfolio. My hedging methods are currently mostly untested (since both my TQQQ and UPRO positions are green), so I’ve given some generic hedging advice above. Take it with a grain of salt.

Another note, assuming you hold both UPRO and TQQQ, exclusively: a 20% drop in SPY causes a trading halt until the following day, *market-wide*, whereas a 20% drop in QQQ caused a trading halt until the following day *for QQQ*, to the best of my knowledge. If, for some reason, SPY hits -20% in one day before QQQ does, trading on QQQ (and TQQQ) will halt till the following day, meaning your portfolio will drop by *less* than 60%. Likewise, if QQQ drops -20% in a day, trading will be halted, while SPY may not drop that much, again resulting in a less than 60% loss of your portfolio.",gzhk5eu,t3_nl9l9d,[],0

909,2021-05-26,investing,"Just saw this. The strike price is set at the time the option is created. So anyone who trades options can set the strike price. If you write an option you could set it at whatever you want (assuming you can cover the margin). Btw also another difference with insurance. With an options account, you can be the buyer or seller of the ""insurance"". Meaning you can collect these little premiums but you run the risk of a a major loss. The key part of options pricing is not so much determining the strike price (as it is an input) but determining the actual price with regards to the strike price. The distance is what matters. If the two are close (and not in the money), it is much more likely to hit the strike and result in a payoff. To stick with the insurance example. The insurance company can keep adding more and more unlikely things but the fees will be smaller (with huge losses in the event of a claim). For example, when you buy coverage for crashing into buildings - the notional value is in the millions and far exceeds the price of the car. There must be a video explaining this better, but if you find a an options calculator you can play around with it and it should make sense. And you can look up the options prices of any well-known stock to see how price changes with regards to strike price.",gzhkuv6,t1_gyoh4cg,[],0

In my brokerage account,  I'll usually have a few thousand in cash sitting there until a ""buy"" idea comes to me.  This cash may linger for days,, weeks,, sometimes a month or two. While that cash is sitting there, it is earning $0.00 @ 0.0% - worse than the worst banks rate.

983,2021-05-26,investing,"Honestly, I don't think anyone is sure themselves other than banks and financial institutions using reverse repo operations with the fed. All anyone can gleam is that these players are flocking to the feds reverse repo facility either from too much liquidity/reserves in the system (money) or a shortage of collateral (treasuries). Why they don't use that cash to fund debt, purchase assets, or whatever else beats me, maybe banks are scared of inflation themselves and don't want more money to flow around and are  sending all excess back to the fed. Maybe this is the fed's way of secretly tapering without actually tapering purchases and sending the market into a freefall. Guesswork at this point but I'm experiencing and seeing the same confusion as you are and not getting any better answers from smart guys in the market from what I've been seeing.",gzhur5f,t3_nlauet,[],0

989,2021-05-26,investing,"I got lucky getting into doge earlyish and made 10k off of my original 10k investment. I left the profits in Doge to let it ride, but now I need to put my money into something a little less volatile. I’m 36, live in the US and make ≈50k/yr. Ideally I’d like to buy a house with the profits. I can consider leaving this money alone for the next 5years, but need it to be somewhat liquid in case of emergency. My risk tolerance is midway between blackjack and 100%. probably a little closer to blackjack. I followed the RH analysts and put 5k into AGCT, but don’t know how to trade options, and the YT tutorials suck noodle. Taking a gamble on CTRM with 1k shares knowing there’s a reverse split coming. Did a little “research” and got 100 shares each of AHT, AIHS, SNDL, NAK, BHAT, ZSAN, and ZOM as well as 1 share of about 15 other stocks just to watch em. 20k Doge still, 1.28 ETH, and 6 ETC.
