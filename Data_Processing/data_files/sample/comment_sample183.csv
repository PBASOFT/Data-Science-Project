96,2021-05-18,investing,"""The second lesson, a lesson in street smarts, Chappelle says he played a Three-card Monte game in New York where he lost $60. Frustrated, Chappelle said he watched the dealer continue his day and realized that the people around him were in on the game.

Chappelle said he saw another man walk up to the table and he warned him not to play the game, saying they were all in on it. He said he was spared a violent retaliation for ruining the dealer’s gig, but was instead taught a lesson about business.

“This man snatched me up by my collar. I could feel how strong he was when he grabbed me, I was a skinny little guy and he was going to maul me,” Chappelle said. “The only reason he didn’t, I’m sure, is because he saw the fear in my face.

People were saying we were due for a bear market from 2012 until we just crashed in 2020.

126,2021-05-18,investing,"Personally I think Amazon is valued in a way which is optimistic but not wholly unjustified (big market share, huge leg up on competition, head start on all the tricky logistics, the company does make money but spends it all on new infrastructure, etc…) 

Tesla is valued as if they’ll have a monopoly on not just electric cars but all passenger vehicles for the next decade at least. That, or people are doing the math and discounting Tesla stock as if it’s a much safer place to keep their money than cash. It makes absolutely no sense unless some truly unbelievable things happen. We can argue about what the things are or how realistic some might be, but for Tesla to be valued even at its current price in 10 years things need to go insanely well for the company.

I get why people like the company generally but IMO people have bid the stock price up to a level where even though the company is solid it’s unimaginable to me that shareholders are going to make anything other than speculative profit for quite some time.

Getting back to Amazon, hypothetically let’s say that once Bezos steps down they decide to not ever grow again and just pay a dividend. Suddenly I think the stock would look pretty attractive - obviously they’re not going to do that, but in a way the focus on growth *is* the dividend. Point being that intentionally having a low EPS in order to grow the business faster and having that make your P/E high (what Amazon does) is a lot different than the price being astronomical based on hype and unreasonable speculation and having that make your P/E high.

Just my $0.02 as some Schmuck on the internet.

TL;DR: I think it’s unfair to compare Amazon to Tesla, because Amazon’s P/E is high because E is intentionally low, whereas Tesla’s is high because P is high to the point of absurdity.",gyjalsd,t1_gyhvw04,['TSLA'],0

133,2021-05-18,investing,">Never called specific percentages, but yes a speculative tech stock having a run like that was always going to lead into a major correction. How is this controversial? I thought this was r/investing?

What's ""controversial"" is the contention in your original post that the timing of the pullback was so obvious, while also saying getting it right is luck. A pullback from an ATH is obvious? Well then, it's not really broken clock lucky guess to figure that out is it? Of course, if you had figured it out, maybe you could have made millions like Burry.

Considering how many new ATHs Tesla hit in its run up, why was the pullback from $900 obvious?

>Burry has been saying Tesla is overvalued for years, so it's not like he all of a sudden came to the conclusion to short.

No, he hasn't. Tesla's massive run up was mostly over 2020, so that doesn't really add up. As far as I can recall, he first announced he was bearish on Tesla in December, which you acknowledged as well. And evidently, he made his bet against it in Q1, at or around the time it hit its highest split adjusted price. Considering the fall since then, he's undoubtedly made a lot of money, so pretty smart move. Which again, if it was so obvious, why didn't you do the same?

>He also believes the entire market is going to crash again soon and has been saying so for years. At some point, he's going to be right just like a broken clock.

You can't really do that when it comes to shorting, since you will lose a ton of money keeping a failing short position open, or at the very least, eat a lot of put option premiums. He was right to the tune of hundreds of millions by being precise about timing his bearish bet.",gyjbebw,t1_gyi8ih2,['TSLA'],0

188,2021-05-18,investing,"In terms of revenue, sure I guess we can put that question aside. But the question is how much revenue is generated outside of the last two or three quarters aka, a normal year. Not the last two quarters. 

Coinbase generates what like 92% or something of revenue from transactions? The other services you mentioned are basic things that a bank does. When they have assets to borrow against, they can do that. Like I said, I’m not short coin so I am not completely familiar with all of their financials and how many assets they have to borrow against. Servicing institutions will never be a large driver of revenue. The transactions are too few and far between. 

On fees, 0.5% remains high. That’s a 50 dollar fee for a 10k transaction. Even if you charged twenty dollars for a trade, as brokers did back in the day, it would be much cheaper. 0.5% is really high. And the vast majority of people on coinbase are paying a much higher fee. But hey, when the money is flowing, who cares about a paltry percent or two. It just keeps on going up baby. 

The second argument for saying coinbase, as a company, has value is that they are a leader in the crypto currency space. 

The technology appears to have promise, but much like the dotcom bubble, crypto currencies have exponentially increased in price based on pure speculation. 

Coinbase is the poster child for this speculation. They have no claim on the blockchain technology, and what they do is not and cannot be unique. If brokerages and middlemen are to be cutout, then Coinbase would be to, because they are the middle man. Robinhood likely does crypto volume which is many multiples of coinbase. But coinbase makes more money because of fees. And coinbase charges the big institutions fractions of what they charge little guys. Go figure. They are valued as a $50b company serving a market that is only ~2 trillion usd. That’s insane. They are only an intermediary. 

In terms of cryptocurrency, I think that some might have value after the speculative fervor subsides, but it’s hard to know which ones. I am of the opinion that Bitcoin will go to zero. 

Bitcoin has no value other than what others are willing to pay for it. This is obvious. Bitcoin especially is a lousy argument to say that blockchain technology is more efficient than any other current payment system. It consumes an insane amount of energy. Saying something is finite is irrelevant and does not make it true. If something can be forked, how does that make it finite? 

There are other blockchains, like ethereum, which seem to be useful. But I don’t think your argument talks about network effects of a blockchain. How does having more users increase the value of a network? 

FOREX is not volatile with respect to Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. That’s simply untrue. While it may be volatile in some respects, inflation of the USD has averaged 2% or less for the last ten years. Inflation of the USD is done on purpose by a central monetary system.

Crypto currency networks are promising in that a currency is created. But really, it’s the blockchain technology behind it that has the value. Currencies must be supported by a government in order to have long lasting value. That’s how modern civilizations work. The currencies are supported by the governments. If a government collapses, so will the currency. The US is nowhere close to that. Any currency which is backed only by the lack of faith in civilization will forever be volatile. Gold is the case and point here. It goes up during times of fear. The case is made again and again about the value of gold as countries collapse. It’s an age-old cycle. 

If Jamie Dimon were losing sleep over zuckbucks, he wouldn’t be the CEO of the biggest bank in the United States. They are developing blockchain technology. But it’ll be a while, and at this point it doesn’t seem like it’s better than current solutions.",gyjg1d3,t1_gyj6xty,[],0

And as far as ""very high returns"" are concerned, one should not expect to make more than a few % on the year, especially if you're new. If you play your cards right, you might end up in range of the market or slightly ahead, and that's usually anywhere from negative (bear market) to about 12%.

237,2021-05-18,investing,"You don't owe taxes on gains and you can't claim losses until you sell.

Every time you sell a capital asset you need to report 1) when you acquired it 2) how much you paid for it (per unit if sold in part) 3) how much you got for it 4) if you held for at least a year. Net all the gains and losses incurred during a calendar year that were from assets you held less than a year (short term). Then net all the gains and losses from assets you held more than a year (long term).

If both are gains, you owe ordinary income rates on the short term and capital gains rates on the long term. If one is a gain and the other is a loss, net them out. For a net gain, pay ordinary rates if long term gains were negative, and pay capital gains rates if short term sales were for a net loss. If the result of netting shirt term and long term gains is a loss, or if both are losses, you can reduce your taxable income (such as wages) by up to 3k of that loss. Unused loss can be used to offset capital gains in future years or reduce taxable income by 3k again each year the following years until the loss is depleted.

You don't have to sell your winners to offset losses but you'll lose money if you fail to report your losses.

745,2021-05-18,investing,"A market crash means that every company crashes. So yes, you are correct in thinking small cap growth will be significantly impacted in a market crash. But so will pretty much every other company as well.

The point is there are other, more clear cut bets to make to take advantage of a full blown market crash. Say calls on VXX, puts on SPX, etc. 

IWO can tank outside of the market tanking. Rates can rise without the broader market falling, and IWO can still lose significant value.

Back to Burry's trade - I think we're on somewhat of a similar page. I see this more as two things:

1. A bet that IWO (Russel 2000 growth) is overpriced and poised to fall. The main thesis behind that bet is that rising rates will act as a catalyst. This does not require a broad market crash, and in fact the broader market may even reach record highs and this bet can still pay off significantly.

2. A bet against the general economy. Because IWO will crash during a general market crash, this bet would pay off in that scenario as well.",gyko5rq,t1_gykh199,[],0

I think the bubble is related to the fact that when people invest in an ETF, they don't realise that most of the ETF's performance is driven by a small percetange of the ETF's holdings. ex: Other than the super stars in SPY like Mircrosoft and Apple, they are overpaying for many companies whose name they don't even know, these companies would have suffered in COVID, a contrast to what the ETF's overall performance would suggest, however.

Investors believe that diversification through an ETF is enough, and therefore don't have to worry about individual holdings, but when too many people pile in, even poorly performing holdings have their individual stock prices increase and become overvalued. This I guess can be considered a bubble.

There is a similar effect when there is an ETF sell-off, where good stocks drop in price since they are holdings in an ETF and so it creates a temporary buying opportunity.",gykob7t,t1_gyjsvwh,['AAPL'],1

818,2021-05-18,investing,"I think in a way you answered your own question to an extent. You stated “Index funds will go down when their underlying holdings go down” which is true. Index funds also go up when their underlying holdings go up. Buying an ETF is awesome, you buy a piece of several different companies at once, and don’t have to worry about rebalancing and diversifying (as much). Some of the simplest and “best” financial advice now is “Buy an index fund and forget about it! People barely beat the market.” So people started doing it. It’s one of the best things to do historically. So now people buy ETFs, and those ETFs purchase those underlying assets. And I think what they’re saying is that people are buying ETFs just for the sake of buying an ETF, they’re really not sure how valuable those assets underneath are. So that leads to companies that are included in ETFs to be artificially inflated. For example, let’s say the only index fund to exist is the sp500. Because of this ETF buying the sp500 P/E ratio of underlying assets would be 50. Meanwhile, the P/E ratio of all other stocks not in the sp500 would be 30. The numbers used are made up just to give an example.     

So in theory ETF buying is pumping up the equity values that are held in ETFs, while stocks that aren’t in ETFs are missing out. 3 of the 4 biggest ETFs track the sp500, which comes to a combined AUM of 865 Billion. However, the counter argument is if this is true (equities are overvalued that are in ETFs), to what extent does it affect the equity values? There are many ETFS, large cap, small cap, bonds, growth, value, momentum, industry specific, etc. It seems any stock is placed in some sort of ETF. Also going back to the 3/4 biggest ETFs tracking the sp500, it’s weighted by market cap, and the biggest companies such as AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, and FB have been extremely well. So while I see the argument that index funds may be overbought and pumping up the underlying equity values, specifically the SP500, those 5 companies along with Berkshire are weighted at about 20% of the index.

Here's why I think everyone is being pitched the ETF bubble talk recently        

\- Off the bat, I don't believe it's a bubble in the long term.  At least in so far as broad market, cap weighted indexes are concerned.  It can potentially generate bubbles in the short term but retail investment has always done this (voting vs weighing).                   

Long story short.  Historically a large part of institutional profits have come from harvesting retail investors.  When you invest passively, you take yourself out of that loop.  Everyone on the institutional side of the market (hedge funds, pension funds, tv personalities, money managers, financial journalists, etc..) has a strong financial incentive to keep you plugged into the market.  The more you trade, the more money they make.  If your trades are limited to long term buy and holds every two weeks within a low fee self directed account, there isn't the market movement necessary to justify their jobs.  Hedge funds don't want to battle other hedge funds, they want to harvest retail investment.

I live in Denmark and would like to use the option of the cheap investing account (""only"" 17% tax), and buy through Saxobank, I saw that recommended through Danish forums. I'm looking for some pretty low risk, stable thing at first, essentially to avoid paying negativ interest on my normal bank account (which is after only 100.000 kr so probably willing to put some into more risk/reward etfs as well). 

Initially I was thinking of just buying one of their managed lowest risk portfolios but I would love to buy some more green and sustainable assets, and they state that it doesn't focus on that. Just I am a total noob and their platform looks pretty complicated, and I have no idea what would be a good, low risk etf to buy (at least I've heard about etf's, lol) considering green options. Any advice is appreciated :)

When interest rates go up, bond prices definitely take a hit without question. 

In recent history, stock prices tend to pull back when interest rates are rising. Monthly return correlation between treasury bonds and stocks tends to be positive when the trend in interest rates is upward. This is usually explained by higher cost of debt, reduced value of future earnings, etc.

His fund then paid premiums to the banks that held those bonds, and those premiums actually went up for a time because when mortgage defaults started happening, the ratings agencies worked with the banks to keep the ratings on mortgage backed securities up and the values of those bonds went up contrary to basic economics.

Banks then kept those ratings propped up while they sold those bad investments to their own customers and billed them as great investments. Once certain banks had taken a net short position on the mortgage backed securities *then* they started marking those assets fairly because it was in their interest to do so.

I think Burry's fund was down -19% and was going to be completely insolvent within a couple of years by the time his absolutely correct thesis finally played out.

1) leverage funds fare very poorly in a volatile and neutral market (ie big swings up and down but little net movement) compared to the underlying. You can potentially lose a lot of money in what is basically an even market. AFAIK this is the reason they warn investors against holding >1day.

2) they DO carry systemic risks, especially if the underlying ETF is secular rather than total market. If NASDAQ goes down (I mean look at the frothy PE ratios...) then TQQQ will plummet even if the the rest of the market is fine.

That said, I do hold leverage ETFs long term (held since 10 years ago, so no 'fastest recovery bias' like the guy below claims), so I do agree with you overall. My financial consultant also thinks it's fine even if he doesn't always recommend it.

Right - but this ""drift"" goes in both directions, and so if you pick a ""safe"" index that's old and reliably as more green days than red (S&P finishes the day higher than it began 59% of the time) it won't matter in the long run because the drift actually works to your advantage.

943,2021-05-18,investing,"The way I understand Burry’s argument, because people are buying index funds more and more instead of individual stocks, companies that are heavily weighted within the index have the potential to become way over valued.  If the heavily weighted companies collapse, the price of the index could collapse with it.  TSLA is a good example and a reason why some people freaked when it was added to S&P500 with a high weighting, among other reasons. TSLA is arguably way over valued and has too much of its future profits priced in. Because it’s now part of the S&P500 index and other indexes, it could force it to become ever more overvalued just because people are inadvertently buying it when they buy ETFs.  If Tesla doesn’t live up to its expectations it could crash the indexes it’s held in, thus popping the bubble.  I’m not 100% sure this is his exact argument, but it’s what I’ve gathered thus far. The thing I don’t understand is that market cap weighting’s are constantly changed within indexes to match the market as closely as possible, which makes me think if there is a bubble it’ll  never pop.

But what if he thinks it is the catalyst for the whole crash?

Last time I checked, he is known for deep value bets. You're talking about it like if it was just a normal/safe bet among others, but what if it's intrinsically linked? What if it's MGS crisis all over again but this time with banks lending to high risk small cap companies inflating their numbers and thus infesting the whole market with toxic securities?

My work retirement plan has pretax and Roth, I'm in both. The pretax's largest holding is SEQUX, while the Roth's largest holding is DSENX. the Roth also owns an index, FXAIX.

I also have a couple iRA's, one that's ETF centric, the other that's individual stocks. The weighting is probably 60/40 at this point, as each month that the individual stocks won, I'd shift more to that account. But in the ETF portfolio, the largest holding there is SPYX.

So overall, I like ETF's, and usually I wouldn't complain about a single company being added, it's just that Tesla went from nowhere to becoming one of the largest holdings in the index that bothers me",gyl0pik,t1_gyjor1z,[],1

Dividends are a share of the income and its ratio is often proportional to stock price. So if there's a dividend aristocrat that's paying $5 a year and its share price is $100, in an imaginary bearish scenario where everything tanks by 50%, there would be a bigger incentive to buy them than the non-dividend stocks.
