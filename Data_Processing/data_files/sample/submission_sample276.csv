Key points:

&#x200B;

The transaction will result in Redbox becoming a publicly traded company with an enterprise value of $693 million.

&#x200B;

The transaction, approved unanimously by the boards of both companies, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021. At that point, Redbox’s common stock is expected to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “RDBX.” The transaction is being funded by a combination of $145 million of cash held in the trust account of Seaport Global Acquisition and a private investment in public equity (PIPE) commitment of $50 million led by Ophir Asset Management.

&#x200B;

After the deal closes, Redbox expects to have approximately $209 million in cash that will be used to pay down existing debt and fund digital expansion, content acquisition and marketing initiatives.

&#x200B;

According to Redbox, it generated $114 million of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in 2020.

My personal opinion, this could be an interesting opportunity especially since Redbox just started launching AVOD service like Tubi/Pluto TV.

They are but they have been making switch to digital. They're also doing avod (free shows/movies with ads) like pluto and tubi.

Redbox has few advantages here

They still have DVDs, revenues are not much but still revenues.

They do EST and VOD, 2 services Tubi and Pluto don't offer

Now they're offering AVOD.

Soon, I suspect they'll be doing originals just like any other service.",nice2u,[],0

293,2021-05-22,investing," Nano Dimension Ltd., together with its subsidiaries, provides additive electronics in Israel and internationally. Its flagship product is the proprietary DragonFly lights-out digital manufacturing (LDM) system, a precision system that produces professional multilayer circuit-boards, radio frequency antennas, sensors, conductive geometries, and molded connected devices for prototyping through custom additive manufacturing. The company also provides nanotechnology based conductive and dielectric inks; and DragonFly and Switch software to manage the design file and printing process. It markets and sells products and services to companies that develop products with electronic components, including companies in the defense, automotive, consumer electronics, semiconductor, aerospace, and medical industries, as well as research institutes. (description taken from Yahoo finance)

This is a company that became a YouTube favorite last year together with Bionano genomics. Cathie Wood started buying into them and then they exploded and became super popular. Their price went from the low 1-2$ to over 15$. During this run some interesting things happened. They started doing stock offerings. When the price went up with 50% they did another offering. The price was dropping 20% and then rallying again and then another offering was coming. They did this again and again and again and at some point people just said the company is diluting too much and it’s going to be a flop. And although usually second offerings are bad in this case I think it was brilliant for the company. Their price went way over what it is supposed to be and they took the advantage to hoard cash. So much that now they have 1.47 billion in cash and their entire market cap is 1.58 billion. That means if you would buy all the shares at the current market price you could pocket the cash and have the company for 110 mil and that makes this company to seem really cheap and the risk of the price going down significantly is really low. Even if the entire manufacturing world would stop today you would basically get 93% of your investment back. Their price was away from fundamentals based on hype and the company took advantage of that which I think it’s a smart move. Now the CEO said they will not do any more dilution because they have enough cash for their planned mergers and acquisitions and also for R&D.

Since they hoarded this cash they acquired two companies: one that is expert in printing micro components (super small mechanical parts) and a machine learning company that they plan to use to improve the quality of their prints and make their 3D printers into a network of printers. I think both of these will help them make more complex PCBAs that could have studs and mechanical clips 3D printed and will reduce the time for assembly. At their last investors call they also announced that they will launch a new 3D printer in the summer. Also they are developing next-gen machines for production (expected to come in 1-2 years). And on top of this they are planning to acquire companies, including PCB manufacturers in Europe and/or US. Quick note: The CEO mentioned a few times they will not acquire companies just to acquire, they will buy someone when the price is right and it helps them to develop vertically and improve their printing tech.

Another way they are consuming the money is R&D and marketing. They need to be heard of to be able to sell and they also need to have high tech. From what I understood they are using silver ink for conductive parts which is conductive enough for anything and for dielectric what they are using now can make PCBs but not high tech ones. They mentioned they made some breakthrough in dielectric materials that they can use but it’s not published yet what it is. It seems at least 30% of R&D expense goes in the materials exploration. I personally love this because if they can position as leaders in this field and have the best tech their competitiveness will make them a behemoth in this field.

The company makes money in two distinct way: selling 3D printers for PCBAs for companies or printing PCBAs for companies as a service. Last year, due to corona their sale of 3D printers went down and that’s understandable. For their 3D printing service I think they are having an issue due to the shortage of semiconductors. Right now if you want to make a board you can print it in China and depending on how fast you want it ready it will cost you more. But if you are ok with waiting 4 weeks for your boards then they become really cheap. Due to shortages in components a lot of companies are ok with waiting because it doesn’t make sense to pay a lot to have your board fast if you need to wait either way for components. The trick is if you want to have it 3D printed by Nano Dimension it’s relatively expensive because it’s fast. Until the semiconductor shortage get’s a bit under control I see NNDM suffering in this field. I had a discussion with their sales representative and got an idea on their prices, it’s a bit high comparatively to traditional PCBAs, while the dimension of the PCBAs they can print is relatively small. Also the CEO said they do not plan to be operating cashflow positive in the next 2 years. This is because they want to expand and cash is not a problem (to put it in perspective, they have 1.4 billion in cash and the 2 new companies costed less than 200mil, R&D costs for a quarter were 3.7 mil). It’s clear that the focus is growth and then switching to positive cashflow.

At their last investor call the CEO of NNDM is mentioning that he wants to revolutionize the printing of PCBAs so that you print just what you need. This will be interesting if it’s possible but I personally doubt this will happen in the next 3-4 years because I’ve seen personally how efficient factories are now when it comes to PCBA manufacturing. What I think it will happen (take this with a chunk of salt) is that they will start printing prototypes for a lot of companies and at some point those companies will just acquire 3D printers for a more agile development in their R&D. Also the space industry will probably use them more and more (they already sent some 3D printed boards to the ISS).

Below you can see their price evolution and all the drops on the way up represent a new stock offering. You can also see that they are increasing their revenue year by year (with the exception of 2020 which is a special year). And they reduced the bleeding in cash flow in the last years. That will look worse for the next years but now they have cash to work with.

617,2021-05-12,investing,"A lot of you have looked at the numbers, but how many of you have actually looked INTO the numbers? I'm going to break down the numbers, and tell you why you're worrying your heads off over nothing. Precursor: Things haven't significantly changed, inflation is no more than it was last month.

#The month on month data:

There's a lot of information to take in, so I'll do my best to explain it in the comments, to anyone confused by what I'm saying. A lot of the explanations are very simple but here goes:

- All items less food and energy account for 79.125 weighting on the whole CPI. Digging into the data, the more heavily weighted portions is commodities less food and energy commodities (which carrys 20 weight). Furniture and bedding increased 2.1% (0.94 Weight). Living room, kitchen and dining furniture accounted for most of this (2.8% change), which can be attributed to the increasingly high lumber prices. 

- Transport commodities less motor fuel was helped push this number up quite a bit, seeing a 4.3% change, which is a 7 weighting. These include new and used vehicles, of which used vehicles sales solely drived up, with a change of 10% which can be attributed to the semiconductor shortage.

- Recreation commodities were up 1.2%, with a weighting of 1.9, with video and audio products essentially carrying this number above average with the help of recreational reading material (1.5%), toys (2.7%), information technology commodities (3.6%), and miscellaneous personal goods (2.1%).

As you can see, a lot of these either involved lumber, or semiconductors. These were all the sectors above the average, and a couple below, the rest managed to pull the full percentage of commodities less energy and food commodities down to a 2%.

The next sector we need to look into is Services less energy services (59 weighting).

- No big increases here in heavily weighted areas. Notable changes were a 7.6% change in Lodging away from home (0.9 weighting), a 10.2% change in Airline fares (0.59 weighting), and a 3.4% change in admissions (0.664 weighting) 

As you can see, this CPI didn't give any clear indiction of inflation. Each significant rise that significantly affected the CPI could be explained by the lumber and semiconductor shortage. There is so much fearmongering going around right now, that I felt like I had to put this out there, because clearly people aren't too willing to look deep into this. 

#The Year on Year CPI data:

If you really think this is evidence of inflation, you're not thinking straight. You're measuring from the bottom of the market, just after the pandemic became real, to where we stand now. 

Anyways, throw any questions my way, or you can find the CPI data if you think I've made all these numbers up. 

TLDR: No inflation (Well there is inflation, obviously, but you get what I mean), lumber and semiconductor shortage help to explain everything.",nawyv7,[],0

738,2021-05-22,investing,"Hi there,

I have been pondering selling a ""hot stock"" that is at a peak, because part of it was an RSU (past the 6 month mark so no fees), and I am curious if I should.

I do think it will go down soon, but I also know it is useless to try to time a market/stock. However, I don't feel comfortable with the amount of stock I have in one stock (if that makes sense). So I would like to sell 3k of this fidelity stock, to buy 3k of a vanguard ETF.

I could wait a few months and just add 3k to the ETF in vanguard and not sell any of the fidelity stock, but I worry I will lose some of the free money from the RSU + stock at it's peak.

This is also the first time I've been in this situation, with a decent emergency fund, maxed 401k, planning to contribute to both mine and my spouse's roth, and HSA maxed end of 2021 (hopefully if no health issues).

So now I'm wondering if it's worth it to start looking at the stocks and moving things around. But, again, I don't know what I'm doing with stocks, so hesitant to sell/buy any except a couple hundred on meme stocks and basic investing through my job/company match.

774,2021-05-22,investing,"I just finished watching a video by former hedge fund manager Lars Kroijer. In the video, he explains how risk-averse investors with a long time frame should invest only in global markets. This strategy leads to maximum diversification.

I gather that this risk minimizing effect as a result of diversification also leads to less exposure of swings in currencies (when buying instruments in currencies other than that of your home countrys). However, if you live in country A with currency A, and buy a world tracker instrument in country B with currency B, will this cancel out the diversification effects, as my purchase would now be subject to swings between currency A and B?

Example:

\- Citizen in Denmark that has a local currency DKK  
\- Buys *iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF* (due to low 0.20% expense ratio) in USD

Would the above person cancel out the positive effects of diversification in regards to currency swings because he would now simply be subject to DKK/USD swings? Or is the entire premise wrong?",nir88v,[],0
