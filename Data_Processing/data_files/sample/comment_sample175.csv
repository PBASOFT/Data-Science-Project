Leveraged ETFs only provide amplified daily exposure. Circuit breaker hits way before the market sees a 40% drawdown. Even with all the volatility of 2020, the largest daily drop of SPY was 12% on 3/16, SSO lost ~24% that day. 

And this is what I meant when I said ""2x the volatility"".

> ... if it goes back up 40% you end up with only 28% of your original money.

Yes, that is how compounding returns work. This has nothing to do with survivorship bias though. 

Survivorship bias would be a valid criticism if there were a bunch of 2x Leveraged S&P 500 ETFs that went bust, or if SSO would have went bust in some past time period, and we're overlooking those other funds or timeframes.",[],0

Fundamentally, being over or under moving average for some time frame means literally that -- some force has pushed price above/below where it was over last <X> time window.  

How you trade that depends on your strategy, what market forces you can see at play (earnings, outlook, regulatory changes, sector rotation, etc). 

A bunch of the common numbers are popular because everyone knows other people are trading on them, so it's useful to watch them as well (even if you counter-trade).

Personally, I think the 200 day average is popular because it's a nice and round, and is near the 182 day average.  Why 182?  Cause that's 1/2 of a year.  Which means the 200d moving average does a nice job detecting cyclical changes as the human economy generally accelerates during spring/summer, and slows down during fall/winter.  

By tracking ""over or under compared to last half year"", you can detect how price is responding as the economy shifts gears, and decide if it's doing a better job of that than your baseline (S&P, US10Y, whatever you prefer to measure against).",[],0

The fed didn't do nearly enough in its last tapering program as it's balance sheet went from about $4.4T to $3.8T in two years. Equities might have performed well but they only reduced the balance sheet by 13%. 

Also, what were interest rates when these tapering periods were occurring? If the FFR was low then equities are going to be a more attractive investment regardless. 

If you don't think that selling trillions of dollars worth of the world's most liquid/invested asset like treasuries wouldn't have an impact, then why would the Fed have to taper? Why don't they just dump half a trillion a month and reduce their balance sheet to pre-GFC levels in six months?

This creates what I would call market leverage — I could coin such a term because the collapse of an underlying asset, we will say Tesla for simplicity, would cause negative reverberations thoughtful the market that are beyond the decline in market cap of that individual stock. This may seem simple, but Burry’s point here is that there so so many index funds tied to volatile stocks (think ARK, moonshot, tqqq, and so on) that a simple decline of 20% of one stock has the ability to possibly create a sell-off due to investors seeing a marked decline in several funds do to one stock under performing. 

Though not as bad as MBS derivatives of 2008, this is an excellent insight as to the danger of putting all your eggs in one basket, likely without conscious effort to do so — especially for new investors simply buying funds that keep going all — all of which are concentrated on a pretty smal subset of funds that have had spectacular returns in sample periods.

Personally, I am concentrating on leveraged T bond funds in my retirement accounts and options on direxion leveraged shorts elsewhere, because I don’t see how M1 can increase indefinitely while artificially-suppressing interest rates without serious negative repercussions.

I sort of assumed that Hometown International Inc., the $100 million or maybe $2 billion deli, would remain a mystery forever, but Mark Vandevelde of the Financial Times seems to have found the person behind it and asked him what he’s up to, and he cheerfully explained it. His name is Manoj Jain and he’s the co-chief investment officer of Maso Capital Investments Ltd., a Hong Kong fund that is one of Hometown’s biggest shareholders. And the explanation is more or less what everyone thought it was: The deli is a shell company that will be used to take an Asian company public in the U.S., sort of like a special purpose acquisition company but sleepier.

For much of the past decade, Maso has busied itself finding ways to help cash-rich companies in Asia transition to nimbler balance sheets. Last year Maso even launched a Spac, with Coker Jr as a director.

“We’re not afraid to roll up our sleeves and be innovators,” Maso’s co-chief investment officer Manoj Jain said. “We’re viewed as proponents of good governance in the region.” ...

“The concept of shell companies has existed globally for many years,” he said. “These are broadly quasi-dormant public companies, that can be used to merge with private companies quickly and easily.”

According to Jain, repurposing an existing business for M&A is an efficient way to extend the Spac model to smaller deals. “The target companies we’re speaking to are in the $300m to $600m zip code in terms of valuation,” he said. “To get it to work from a public market perspective, the Spac needs to be $75m to $100m.”

Yet setting up a Spac can cost millions of dollars in administration fees alone, eating up a large portion of the value in such a small deal. “[Hometown] is a more flexible structure . . . with a longer time to find a target, and a better economic uplift,” Jain said.

“It works like a mini-Spac,” he added. “When you execute the merger, the name changes, the ticker changes, the board changes, the management changes, everything changes, as the merged entity enters the US capital markets.” … Jain believes that, with the right acquisition target, Hometown may be able to list on the Nasdaq exchange.

From the beginning of the deli saga, this explanation — that the deli was going to do a reverse merger to take an Asian company public and then jettison its deli business, change its name and be the public vehicle for that unrelated new business — seemed to be the most likely answer, and here you go. U.S. public-company status — even on the over-the-counter markets, without a stock exchange listing — is valuable, so it makes sense that some investors in Hong Kong might put $2.5 million into a barely operating deli to buy its public status, and then try to find a company that could make better use of that status.

Ransomware Threats Are Everywhere. Here's How to Fight Back.
This does not really explain why it’s a $100 million deli, but, surprisingly, it does help explain why it’s a $2 billion deli. The deli’s $100 million basic market capitalization comes from multiplying its 7.8 million shares outstanding by its last trading price ($13 per share as of yesterday’s close, for a market cap of $101.4 million). That is too high. A U.S. public company shell is valuable, but it’s not worth $100 million, so you would not expect an acquirer to pay $100 million for the deli just to get its securities registration. But the stock doesn’t trade much, and for some mysterious reason some people seem willing to pay $13 per share to buy small amounts of it. I can’t explain this, but I don’t worry too much about it: That $100 million valuation is not all that economically meaningful. It’s people buying a few hundred or thousand dollars’ worth of stock, not millions.

But I have insisted that the deli’s actual valuation is $2 billion, which is its fully diluted market capitalization. This weird number comes from the fact that the deli has weird warrants. In April 2020, Hometown got a $2.5 million investment from a handful of investors (including Maso), who bought stock at $1 per share (for a fairly reasonable post-money valuation of about $8 million 1 ). The next day, Hometown issued 20 warrants per share to each of its shareholders (including the brand-new ones, Maso et al.). Each warrant allows the holder to buy one more share for $1 each.

The result was that the deli was an $8 million shell company with a $2.5 million pot of cash (much of which it seems to be spending on consulting fees paid to those same shareholders), but with a $156 million pot of, as it were, contingent cash: The shareholders have made arrangements to put in up to another $156 million at some point in the future. 2  If the deli finds a good company to merge with and take public (or, rather, if Maso finds a good company for the deli to merge with), that company won’t pay to acquire the deli (and its public status). Instead, the deli will pay to acquire a stake in the company. It will be less like a typical reverse merger (a private company paying for an empty corporate shell) and more like a SPAC: The deli is a vehicle to both take a company public and raise money for it. The money will come not from the cash currently on the deli’s balance sheet (a modest $1.4 million as of the end of 2020), but rather from the $156 million that the deli’s existing investors have arranged to invest in the future. It’s like a SPAC, but instead of raising a pot of money and then hunting for a company to take public, it will hunt for the company to take public and then raise the money with warrants. 3  

I am not sure that this is a perfect plan from either a financial or a securities-law perspective, but it makes a sort of rough sense. For the first time, I feel like I understand the deli. Now let’s hope it does something else weird to keep us on our toes.

Also Vandevelde managed to get a cheesesteak at the deli. There’s a picture of it with the article. Planet Money’s Jacob Goldstein also went and got a turkey hoagie. It was apparently pretty good. If the shell-company reverse-merger-ing doesn’t work out, Hometown might have a lucrative future selling stunt sandwiches to financial journalists.",[],0

2) there is a chance the customer loses the gift card or simply doesn’t redeem some of their paid for items in the timeframe.

yes it gets taxed , but if you have solid companies, the underlying assets do not degrade. 

it is debateable if this is a good strategy to intitially grow your wealth (it certainly is not the most efficient and certainly does not offer the highest growth potential) but it works. 

I love dividends. I use them rightnow to boost my income already. 

and if you mix & match you can achieve stable dividend income at about 6-8% with a certain amount of diversification. 

if you really want to do this, do not go for the highest yield only. go for stability .

maybe take a look at   
REIT´s   
energy stocks

financials (banks etc.)  


depending on how you split your money, you can cover a lot of industry sectors and still get very good payouts. achieving an overall dividend yield of over 6% is certainly not impossible.

The issue with an index is that capital is allocated based on an investment strategy that does not necessarily match the fundamentals. What Michael Burry et al. are correct about is that actively managed funds should be able to sort the wheat from the chaff, whereas an index will likely just buy all of them.

How would this affect your concept of owning dividend stocks just for the yield?

What you should do is either buy great companies and hold them long term, or find distressed companies and stay for the turnaround, something like AT&T might be the latter, but it also might get crushed mismanagement and the weight of their debt. Maybe then you might avoid bag holding T for 9 years. 

Also, just another reason that dividend yields are mostly irrelevant, let's look at something like AAPL, which just announced a $90 billion dollar buyback. At the current 2.21T market cap, this represents about a 4.1% return to shareholders, excluding AAPL's dividend.

317,gyli8j2,2021-05-18,t3_nfhan1,investing,"Anyone that expects 10% returns lives in a fantasy land.  At best equity returns globally have been closer to 7%.  The domestic market has actually been a bit of an outlier in a few ways - some being survivorship biases tied to the post WWII environment, regulatory reform creating previously unanticipated premia, falling discount rates, and decoupling yields from real yields.

The concept everyone should understand here isn't historic return.  It's historic and anticipated risk premia.  Risk premiums effectively say ""an asset is priced for higher return because it has higher risk"".  When you own equities you are inherently taking the riskiest position in the capital structure, so equities carry the highest risk premium.

Historically that has been around 5%, but there's enough research out there on the subject to cast serious doubt that this relationship will continue.  For one it has not been the global experience that risk premia maintains 5% over time - even more curiously domestic equities are generally a safer stream of cashflows than many international ones, so the heightened risk premium is likely a result of historic accidental factors rather than some firm financial logic.  

Basically - equities will continue to be one of the best drivers of wealth over time, specifically because they place you as the owner of the stream of cashflows tied to the broad market.  That said anyone who anticipates 10% just because that's what it's done in the past is delusional, or simply doesn't understand what drives equity returns.  Anyone basing their personal financial planning off such a lofty return figure will be in for a fairly rude awakening, likely once it's too late to make major course adjustments. 


Like, on a personal level I think it's insanely reckless how people in subs like /r/financial independence push the idea that you can accumulate like 1.5MM and just live off it for the rest of your life.

I'll say we're all mostly in agreement about the unlikelihood of meltdown because boomers retiring. However, I will say that MB isn't wrong in that the index funds have all the right features of a bubble or to form a bubble:

* General lack of understand of the underlying investment. And the investors actively being ignorant to it.

* The general push of funds into said investment.

* The general mentality of ""Just keep putting money in. It only goes up in the long run. And whatever dips will be gone in a few years. Even if you bought the top"" This probably the most important part. I remember this was literally the mentality of real estate investing prior to the 07 crash. 

MB (and trad economist) note that it's usually leverage and pumping that causes bubbles. Which I also believe could be true as well. People might be more willing to buy more and more into VOO than even the best stock because the diversification reduces risk. Someone who won't buy GOOG on margin might feel safe enough to do it for the SPY.

I think the big index funds are more likely to create larger swings than actually be the bubble themselves. They allow people to buy in easily, have stronger faith in the safer asset class and use leverage, and finally easily pull out when they think things are going down. Index funds will add upward push to the stocks and market when going up and will add additional downward pressure when markets go down much like leverage.",[],0

Which means ETFs that attempt to emulate the S&P 500 will adjust their holdings down. Likewise, ""superstars"" in such holdings, whose market cap increases, will be adjusted up.

Your TLDR is accurate, though, since an ETF is playing catchup to rebalance changes that have occurred in the market over the last quarter (or whatever interval is used).

This is what diversification is all about. in this instance, you are including foreign stocks and bonds. Over he past 20 year a portfolio with international stocks and bonds will underperform us stocks. However historically International and US stocks each have periods of out performance. The bonds are there to intentionally sacrifice growth for less volatility in the portfolio.

If this is true. you are not picking an overall index. by definition the overall index would be the same regardless of provider. It is likely you are picking a fund that is either more concentrated to a specific sector, factor or market cap.

More money entered the stock market last year and in the previous 10 years, or something like that, driven primarily because there wasn't anything else for us to do. People took what they would have spent, invested it in the market, got some great returns, but those same people are probably going to make up for a lot of spending on things they put off during this whole pandemic. Vacations, dining out, everything. When that happens, and the market is seeing net outflows every month, of course the indexes are going to go down. And of course, burry is going to say ""See? I told you so"". But in that case, while his answer was right ""the markets will go down"", the reason (in my view) will be completely wrong. 

If $400 billion gets withdrawn from the stock market, it's going to drive down prices, whether that money comes from broad index funds or if that money was invested in individual companies, I don't think it'll make a big difference.

Price discovery hasn't gone away. The pro shops and lots of us retailers use limit orders, that's the price discovery mechanism. Even if for every dollar of limit order there are two dollars of market orders flowing into index funds, it's not that the money went to index funds that will drive up up prices, its because there have been so many more buyers than sellers.

So, where to hide out?

I honestly don't think there are many good places to hide. Equities will get hurt everywhere from the S&P500 members to the ""tiny companies"" you'll find exposures to in much broader ETF's like VT and VTI. Yields are going back up after hitting record lows, so that doesn't bode well for fixed income investors. 

Despite my bearish outlook, I'm continuing to stay invested. I am carrying a bit more cash than usual on account of not wanting to hold bonds in this environment, but since I still have a couple decades left in my investing career, I would welcome lower prices and stay my course. I do separate exposures to various real assets, TIPS, and a small basket of companies which I think can navigate whatever the future throws at us, all in addition to index funds.

It's going to be a roller coaster, but even if Burry calls the correct end result, I'm not prepared to give him any credit. Yes, he called the mortgage crisis correctly, but I just think (to repeat) his assessment is wrong because it overlooks that all the money that came into the market would have still gotten invested whether it went into index funds, mutual funds, or individual stocks, and (again) it was that volume of buying that ran up the prices, not the vehicle it was invested in",[],0

If you truly believe that there will be a crash then the best option is to short the index funds. Sadly most people don't have the funds, knowledge, or sheer balls to short goliath. So in that case some high-yield inflation-adjusted government bonds from a country that is largely isolated from the epicenter of the potential crash?

China bonds paying around 3.6% yield now. Will likely go higher as economies heat up. Normally during economic crisis the USD gains strength against everything else as the default ""safe haven"" currency, but that might not be the case if it was a US crash of epic proportions. The 2nd factor why Chinese would be because it's the 2nd largest economy but has severe market restrictions and will actively pop forming bubbles because the CCP fears crashes which could lead to civil unrest. 3rd factor would be that most of these index funds are US based investing into what are mostly US companies.

You could get higher yields with Russia ~7% or Argentina ~50%, but those countries don't have the economy to power through a mega-recession (and thus collect taxes to pay the bonds), societal stability of an authoritarian dictatorship, or the economy of scale to rival the US. You could also try South Korea with a 2.2% rate, but that's miniscule, Korea's economy isn't as big or stable as China's. And the WON tends to fall relative to the USD when shit hits the fan. And of course you can always buy lower yield US bank notes.

Still this is largely hypothetical. I don't think there will be a big market correct for at least a few years. Usually market tanks come every 7-12 years rather than 1-2 years after. By that time, you never really know what will be the problem.",[],1

But because it's almost the entire market it might not be intrinsically problematic. Basically stocks are over-valued compared to other asset classes, but given the huge role public firms play in the world economy, that doesn't seem that problematic. 

2) If investors, however, have highly varying systemic doubts or are on average over-leveraging or buying ETFs beyond their investment holding window, the stock market boom over the past 15 years or so could lead to an ugly correction. Like any bubble. 

Basically people have massively over-bought into the passive investing ETF craze (which honestly does have a LOT going for it). A crash and resultant loss of paper wealth might have economic effects that might signal a longer-term recession. 

3) I'm somewhat doubtful of the etf bubble theory. The entire stock market seems the definition of too big to fail. It seems in any prolonged depression the Fed will step in to ensure cheap money. PERHAPS, and this is highly unlikely, if crypto does unseat the Fed as a monetary authority, we might see the real cost of speculation. But the dynamics of both retail investors and large funds leveraging off the expectation of rescue - moral hazard basically - might be another major source of systemic risk. 

If anyone has a chart of share of etfs and stock market as total investments over past decades, please share! 

4) To attempt to answer the question, there doesn't seem any way to avoid the stock market and earn the 6-8% it's associated with. Doing so will assume you'll be able to pick winners out of the entire ETF line-up. In any proper crash resulting from an ETF bubble burst, your narrow picks would fall anyway, and very possibly fall more than the market decrease. 

The partial answer then might be a truly long investment window (>20 years) to ride out any of the above fluctuations, asset diversification - including buying the house that you plan to live in and a neighborhood that you expect to appreciate, and focusing on increasing your earning power in your career.",[],0

The second is that the entire ""safe withdrawal rate"" framework is based on US market returns.  So from a conceptual standpoint it's rather silly - they've basically said ""well, if we have another century where we're the best performing market in the world by a significant margin you're fine"".

742,gym6ofg,2021-05-18,t3_nfhan1,investing,"> Saying that 10% returns can be expected in the future because thats what’s happened over the past 95 years is just using past performance to project future results ... Just because businesses have grown at a rate of 10% annually since 1926, why should investors expect 10% in the future?

Most of us passive indexers make no such claims about future performance. We accept that the market may return more or less, but either way: that actively timing or stock picking will statistically do worse. I look at valuations and make estimates but I don't change my portfolio around them, just my saving/spending plans.

> It seems illogical to have your retirement rely on a system that is based on past performance from only the past 95 years. 

What's the alternative? Sit in cash? Pay fund managers money to underperform (which, on the whole, they do after fees and taxes)? Try to do your own research and best the people who do this full-time? That's the problem with criticizing indexing out of hand - you have to suggest what would work better for people.

> If we had 1,000 years of historical data showing that the S&P returns 10% annually, I think that it would be ok to say that 10% can be expected for a 45 year window of retirement investing.

So first, I would never recommend investing only in the 500 index of US stocks - might as well go global. Second, I would also recommend adding bonds. But the main thing (again) is that no one is saying 'indexing will give you %XX returns' - you'll get the market returns with less fees.

The more time you take to DCA, the more cash drag affects your returns. If you invest all of your money at once, you are 100% exposed and your performance will mirror the stock market.

The average direction of the returns of the stock market is positive, which means you miss out on gains on average.

DCA of 1 year adds an annual underperformance of 0.38%. Basically an MER of 0.38% for an ""active"" strategy.

Ben Felix released a paper if you want to see more.

https://www.pwlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Dollar-Cost-Averaging-vs-Lump-Sum-Investing.pdf

https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/101

He also explained it in one of his podcasts. Timestamp at 31:49. The 0.38% number is at timestamp 38:32.

By not having all of your money tied to the stock market at T+0, you aren't efficiently capturing the rise of the market as a whole. This results in underperformance of your portfolio compared to the market.

He looked at 10-year rolling periods (Jan 1970 - Jan 1980, Feb 1970 - Feb 1980, etc), individually in Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, UK, and the US, of 100% equity portfolios. DCA was done with $1 million over 12 months.

On average, the annual growth of the DCA portfolio trailed the lump sum portfolio by 0.38%.

However in last years, players field got suddenly so competitive. Every million hand I made less money. My profitability went down. Top earners start to earn less. My game has not change, but everyone got so solid. Reality has change.

You can do a pretty good job of estimating whether you will be alive in 5, 10, or even 50 years. But some of us will die much earlier, others will live longer.

In terms of investing, you will be better off in most of the likely worlds if you invest. In some possibilities, your investments won't matter to your quality of life for all sorts of personal, economic, or geopolitical reasons. I happen to think it is likely that I will live at least 20 if not 35 years. Investing now increases the likelihood that my life will be better in the future.  It is a risk because I could spend now and get an immediate benefit, but it is a calculated risk based on my estimate of the likely outcomes.

It is my estimate that I have a higher likelihood of improving my circumstances by investing in index funds rather than stock picking, directed mutual funds, or using an advisor. Some people may have the skills to pick stocks, mutual funds, or advisors. But I don't.  So by choosing one of these options over index funds, I don't think I would have any better than a random chance of outperforming the market.

The problem here isn't forecasting, it's people intentionally trying to mis-represent what return forecasting is in order to create some stupid dismissive narrative.  

Here's a paper by the former head of asset pricing for NBER, it was their presidential address to the American Finance Association - so basically this is about as mainstream and accepted as things get: https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w16972/w16972.pdf

Here's a relevant excerpt: 

>Thus the estimates say that all price-dividend ratio volatility corresponds to variation in
expected returns. None corresponds to variation in expected dividend growth, and none to
“rational bubbles.”
In the 1970s, we would have guessed exactly the opposite pattern. On the idea that
returns are not predictable, we would have supposed that high prices relative to current
dividends reflect expectations that dividends will rise in the future, and so forecast higher
dividend growth. That pattern is completely absent. Instead, high prices relative to current
dividends entirely forecast low returns.
This is the true meaning of return forecastability.4 This is the real measure of “how
big” the point estimates are — return forecastability is “just enough” to account for price
volatility. This is the natural set of units with which to evaluate return forecastability.
What we expected to be 0 is 1; what we expected to be 1 is 0.",[],0

CPI looks at all consumer goods and services to get a better handle on the monetary situation of the entire country. Picking and choosing which goods and services to include in the CPI will lead to an incomplete view of inflation and the economy as a whole. 

If you’d like, you can construct your own necessity price index using the component price indices at FRED, the federal reserve’s economic data portal. When I tried my hand at it, I used shelter, food at home, medical care services, transportation, and fuels+ utilities. I used the same component weights as the CPI does, since they’re based on how much consumers spend on each respective item. I actually found that median personal income, even adjusted for this new price index, has increased over time. 1989 and 2007 took nearly a decade to recover, but 2019 had an all time high necessity-inflation-adjusted median personal income.

979,gymjbu2,2021-05-18,t3_nfhan1,investing,"Look at the return of an ETF or fund over the last 5 years, you'll see ot has different performance every year. But you can also say that on the last 5 years it has got an average yield of x%. To compute this average yield use the CAGR formula (see Wikipedia CAGR).

Now you are not guaranteed to get that yield next year, you might get more, you light get less, the past yearly yields are a good exemple of that.

However you can still use it to decide in which fund or ETF to invest. If you have to pick between 10, you will not pick the one that has had negative result over the last years as it could be evidence of poor management decisions for an actively managed fund, or that the sector or thematic an ETF focus is in decline. But you might not want to pick the best performing one either because he might not be reproductible year over year, it could do 32% one year and  -4% the second year, its less predictible. Or maybe that market sector is already too high and might not perform as well over the next decade.

Usually you should aime for fund with CAGR between 4-10% mixing it up somewhat. Get some that are very predictible (ie almost the same performance every year) even if it is only 4-5% to build a stable basis in your portfolio. Complement this with a few that provide better results even if they don't get those huge result every year.",[],1

It's useful when looking at history because it gives you some idea of what the future probabilities might look like.
