17,2021-05-25,algotrading,"Hello.  I made a binary classifier.  It detects whether I should buy a stock or not.  Right now the ""do not buy"" has around a 95% accuracy and the ""buy"" has around 52% accuracy.

I can balance the accuracy numbers, but as one goes up in accuracy the other one goes down.

It is very important to me to make correct picks, because picking the wrong stock could lead to a loss of money.  Should I try to weight the classes and balance out the accuracy, or just take it as-is?

31,2021-05-17,algotrading,"Sorry if this is not the right community to ask this in, but, I'm currently a second year finance and economics student, studying at a quality university with a higher focus on quantitative methods. I have already studied an elementary econometric course covering regression, multiple regression, binary, logit and probit etc, etc. In the next year or so I will  have the option to choose some more intermediate level to advanced econometric courses. I'm just wondering how applicable the models ill learn in econometrics are to issues outside the social science spectrum? That is, the application of econometric models to data for purposes of non-formal analysis, maybe even call it ""recreational analysis"". For example, i know that certain models when meeting certain conditions, can be applied to social science type issues/experiments, but what if i wanted to try leverage econometric modelling to perform analysis on more niche things such as sports (like is presented in moneyball for example) or even other games such as card games or stocks(though i know econometrics is already prevalent here).  I love finance and have an avid interest in statistics, stata and other programming languages, and want to deepen my statistical modelling capacity  beyond that of regressions, etc. I am really considering chasing this pathway, however, i am worried that the absence of applicability to anything outside of social science type experiments , in addition to a high focus on theoretical content over practical implementation will lead to growing boredom of the subject if i were to study it.  Hence, why i ask whether what i learn can be to at least some extent applied to recreational type ""experiments"", where my knowledge feels more tangible as i can actively apply what i have learnt to things that can be analysed with statistics and that are of interest to me, outside on my studies of course.",ne5v5k,[],1
32,2021-05-17,algotrading,"Hi, I have a basic background in stats and wrote a script to screen for volume activity in stocks that have high covariance. Unsurprisingly, most tickers had a very low covariance in volume being less than 0.1.

33,2021-05-17,algotrading,"Looking to the wisdom of the crowds  to see if there are any ideas on identifying the commonalities of my strategy's ""win"" stocks.

I came up with an algorithm that I like and backtested it across the S&P 500 population. I found a reasonable subset of stocks that were successful with the scalping strategy, but I want to reverse engineer *why* those stocks were successful vs the others which weren't. It's possible that it's random, but my hypothesis is that it isn't, and I want to try to further refine the strategy by finding what maximizes the odds of a stock being in the win group.  


Given n stocks that were successful at a strategy (or conversely m stocks that weren't), how would you find what they had in common? Is this a good application for ML or should I be testing against all possible metrics I can think of (various moving averages, variances, std dev's, etc.) If it's the latter, is there a list of metrics somewhere you can think of to test against?

34,2021-05-17,algotrading,"How do algorithmic trading systems usually *consume* structured event data? 
To be clear, I'm not referring to price / market information, but metadata like news sentiment & happenings (e.g. announcement of company merger, executive departure, ..). I'm also *not* looking for instructions on how to *get* structured event data, I'm trying to figure out how traders can work with already existing event data.  

I'm looking for

 - information & terminology on this approach (there must be a proper name?)
 - general strategies for consuming this type of data
 - specific formats that are commonly used 

I'm happy to dive into any books, source code, whatever resource or other jumping off point that might be helpful. 

For context, I'm building a crypto intelligence platform - basically it aggregates meta-information from many sources (source repositories, social accounts, blogs, forums, governance) into a structured feed of events (releases, partnerships, listings). This has the massive advantage of low latency & great coverage compared to human-curated feeds. I'm exploring how this might be used by trading systems, but I'm completely green in that regard.

42,2021-05-18,algotrading,"I have always been curious about game theory, but have been to intimidated to try to learn it. This week, I have decided to try and shake my fear and begin to learn about some basic principles in game theory:

I am looking at this basic problem in game theory that asks how should the owner of a company split the profits between her and her workers:

https://imgur.com/a/aDa5jiE

I am having some difficulty in understanding the notations:

1) "" Formally, a coalitional game is defined as: There is a set N (of n players) and a function and a function v that maps subsets of players to the real numbers: v : 2^N -> R , where v(""empty set"") = 0""

a ) Why does "" v : 2^N ""? Is the point of this expression to show all the possible interactions that can exist between any groups of players? 

b) When considering the ""value function"" (i.e. ""v"") , why does v (""empty set"") = 0? I guess this is an obvious statement, but is it supposed to mean that the potential value of the interaction between ""no players"" (i.e. the empty set) is ""0""?

2) Now, the problem where the owner of a company split the profits between her and her workers:

- The owner is represented by the symbol ""o""
- There are ""m"" number of workers (w1, w2, w3 ... wm)
- Each worker contributes an amount ""p"" to the profit

I am having difficulty understanding how the ""value function"" for this problem is determined:

The value function for the coalition of players (the coalition is denoted by ""S"") is:

- v(S) = mp, if the owner is included in the coalition 
- v(S) = 0, if the owner is not included in the coalition 

My question: How are v(S) = mp and v(S) = 0 initially determined? Or are these values assumed?

3) In this question, ""m"" is defined both as ""the number of workers"" as well as the cardinality of : S / {o} .

I have generally heard ""cardinality"" referred to as the ""size of a set"". What exactly does cardinality mean in this question? Are you supposed to be able to compute "" S / {o} ""? Why does ""S / {o}"" = m?

4) Can someone please walk me through the calculations? Why according to the Shapley values, should the profit be distributed such that: the owner receive ""mp/2"" and each worker receive ""p/2""? 

5) Lastly : Why is this question important? Is the point of this question to show ""the fairest distribution of profits according to contributions""?

Thanks

So far I had little success because of high fees and low price volatility. The main problem is that if I hold some asset for more than 30 seconds it becomes unreasonable because the bot itself cant see that far into the future.

I know that HFT is a thing but in my case its about 250ms latency so its not that.

So before I spend another 60hours on this, since I have little experience in finance I want to know: does trading high volatility stocks make sense on intervals 30sec or less, or the profit will not cover transaction fees and Im better off developing longer period strategies?

So far I did binance using real time orderbook data, 0.01% fees, +0.02% take profit and -0.1% stop loss. At best it went from 10k to 10k+8$ in a few minutes and then bought DOGECOIN and went to 10k-50$. Average scenario it looses about 1-2$ a minute (OMEGALUL).

In order for my idea to work I need to design a system which can monitor options prices of a handful of companies with large options chains.

49,2021-05-18,algotrading,"Hello everyone. I'm a programmer with about 15 years of experience and I've already written an application in C# that scrapes stocks and automatically places orders through an API. This all works well. The issue I'm experiencing is that I'm trying to make an intelligent machine that will make the decision to Buy, Sell, or Hold on every 1 second interval.

I've done a loooooot of research into ML the past three months and I'm currently using Google's Tensorflow to try and create an Agent that can do this. I'm having varying degrees of success

My first model was a modified DQN ( [https://github.com/benjamin-dupuis/DQN-snake](https://github.com/benjamin-dupuis/DQN-snake)) It was kind of close, but I just couldn't get a reliable sell to occur. It buys, and holds well, but the sell is unreliable.

I then discovered the Multi Armed Bandit model ([https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/bandits\_tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/bandits_tutorial)) and that sounded a little bit closer. I used some of Googles samples to build an MAB using a couple of different types: Linear Stochastic and a Drifting Stochastic. Neither worked quite as well as I hoped either.

Has anyone had good experience with autotrading using a specific DQN or MAB model? I'm wondering if I'm expecting too much from machine learning...  

My features are AskPrice, BidePrice, Delta (change in Ask Price over last reading), IsInvested (1 or 0), Profit ( -1 if invested, else ranges from -1 to 1).  

I'm using both positive and negative rewards. It seems I get the most variance in my results when adjusting reward patterns.

51,2021-05-18,algotrading,"Through both backtesting, as well a few articles I've read here's one: 

https://www.quant-investing.com/blogs/general/2015/02/16/truths-about-stop-losses-that-nobody-wants-to-believe

This article suggests that a 20% stop loss is best to use, because the 5, 10, etc stop you out too soon. Lower stop-losses tend to offset and major losses in a short period, but over a long term they are wildly less profitable. I was curious if anyone else had found the same?

Here's my backtests:

Over 1,500 trades a 10% stop-loss would net me a 1.35% return (per 100% of my account traded).

Over the same 1,500 trades a 20% stop-loss would net me a 2.3% return (per 100% of my account traded).

Now, I'm not suggesting that 1,500 trades is a good back test. I would probably aim for a number closer to 10,000. However, the article tested this method over 85 years! Using my specific test as an example, I was very surprised to find such a wild difference in profit. I was curious if anyone else has had similar results? If so, why do you think this is?


Note: I only throw about 10% of my account at any single trade. So if a 20% stop loss did occur, it would be a 2% hit on my overall account which aligns with the following article:

60,2021-05-19,algotrading,"TD Ameritrade's API is very popular for those of us that are interested in trying to build their own trading tools. The TDA API is also nice in that it supports option trading and is a good source of data for current option chains. However, the method used, get\_options\_chain, returns a JSON object that has a pretty complicated structure. It's a nested dictionary that mixes dicts and lists, where (at least) one of the lists has a single member that is a dict (at least that is how Python views it).

I really struggled to deal with it, and the only way I found to completely decompose it to (key, value) pairs was to use recursion. To save others the pain I went through, I created a GitHub repo with a couple of examples that will:

* Print out on your console every key/value pair in the get\_options\_chain JSON object
* Write the retrieved JSON object to a JSON file on your local machine.

It's currently generating income for me and my partners and neither of us work for hedge funds or anything, mostly just part time work accumulating over a few years. We started with promising manual strategies and added more automation as we went along.

This algorithm monitors a few thousand symbols, mostly US and CA stocks and executes anywhere between 1-30 trades per day, almost every day but with more activity around quarterly reporting.

The strategy to generate the signals uses a few ML models trained on historical data over the past few years on data extracted from Thomson Reuters, as well as on our own proprietary formulas (in total, a few hundred features we deem most important are used in training).

For trade execution, we wrote our own software in .NET interfacing with IBKR. Machine learning is almost all Python.

For backtesting, we use QuantConnect as well as some in-house built software. This is mostly to try optimize certain parameters (entry/exit times, allocations, ...).

69,2021-05-20,algotrading,"Hi everyone,

for a grad level Machine Learning Class I recently completed, I built a decision tree to predict whether  a stock from the 30 companies in the DOW would return 0.5% or more by end of a week using the previous 6 weeks of data.

Our data was limited to the 2011 Q1 and Q2 Dataset, and just included Weekly stock price, volume, days to dividend, and % dividend. we trained on Q1 and tested on Q2.  We found our tree performed best using an RSI indicator, MACD indicator, Previous Week Price Change, previous 6 Week price change, days to dividend, and % dividend return.

Moving forward, despite overfitting with too many parameters being a constant theme that people warn about (with good reason I'm sure), I'd like to try building some huge trees/neural networks using just about as many attributes as possible and then start eliminating those that seem to do more harm than good.

Like before I will be choosing from the DOW, but I'll be incorporating other factors.  Previously my only live Algotrading has been with crypto, and frankly has been very frustrating.  I've learned how TA indicators really are just a little better than a coinflip, and there are much fewer attributes to incorporate with Cryptos as opposed to an actual stock in a company.  Hence why I'd like to try incorporating as many attributes as possible since I've felt really limited to just TA indicators with crypto trading.  

I've listed all the parameters I want to start pulling data for below, but please add any that I have not thought of.  Please feel free to give any advice on how to best apply these indicators (eg, how long of a moving average should I use for tracking Number of Mentions in Social Media? 2 days? Hourly? Weekly?....)  Also feel free to point out if any of my suggested attributes are particularly important or totally useless.  Thanks so much for any insight! It will save me countless hours working with data that winds up being completely useless

&#x200B;

Currently, the list of params I think I would be useful and want to incorporate:

1) Use of 2-3 Technical Indicators at Most 

 \-> This is probably my biggest concern.  From what I've read on here, using multiple TA to make a tree  or neural network is essentially just mutating the same data over and over again, which doesn't produce distinctly different attributes that will improve prediction accuracy

\->That being said, I would think 2-3 TA indicators can help establish a positive market trend , and define whether the trend is long or short term (eg 2 week avg is above 200 day avg, and a positive MACD, I would consider a valuable set of attributes that Stock is Bullish). 

2) P/E Ratio.  This an obvious useful tool for company fundamentals.  

3) Related Raw Materials Costs (e.g. my neighbor works at a Brewing Company and mentioned how high aluminum costs and no bars pouring drafts means more canning, which has been cutting into profits despite record sales)

4) Overall Market Trend (is DOW/S&P bearish or bullish)

5) Relationship to Similar Companies (e.g. is Coke lagging behind Pepsi? Do we expect Coke to Rise or Pepsi to Crash, or both?)

6) Scan internet for major News Outlet Mentions (e.g. Did Jim Cramer recommend on his show?)

7)  Sentiment Analysis and Popularity Growth from Reddit,Twitter (is it increasing or decreasing? Is sentiment mostly positive?)

8) VIX to incorporate risk due to volatility, help define higher/lower bail thresholds

9) Strike Prices and Expirations Dates of Puts/Calls (essentially applying the Max Pain strategy where major Hedge Funds that sell options try to manipulate prices to not go above/below a certain range to ensure the vast majority of options expire worthless.)

10) Depth Charts to view major sell/buy walls

11) Days to Dividend, % Dividend Return

&#x200B;

\*As  a side note, I wanted to mention that I've found Volume to be completely useless attribute, but perhaps I'm not using it right.  Even if I'm able to see if most of the buying is Maker side (which is not always available info), I already can tell because the price is increasing, as one would expect.  The price and Buy Volume I've found are essentially just the same data, if buy volume increases, price increases proportionally.  The only strat I've heard that uses volume that sort of makes sense is that big money Firms tend to increase volume substantially, while keeping price as unchanged as possible, and eventually reduce supply until price eventually does jump.  Other than that, I've yet to find a way to use volume effectively, but please let me know if I'm completely missing something here.

I simulated different threshold values from 5 to 100 to measure the likelihood of the next day being a positive day and found that when the price closes nearer the low, the next day is more likely to be an up day (The x axis on the chart is the threshold and the y axis is the likelihood of the next day being an up day)

This post is not about ""setting up your first trading bot"". My own first took me one weekend to write and I launched it live following Monday, that part is really not a big deal, relatively to everything else afterwards. I'm talking about becoming consistently profitable trading live for a meaningful amount of time (at least couple of years). Withstanding non favorable conditions. It's much more than just writing your first bot. And I almost guarantee you, your first strategy is gonna fail live (or you're truly a genius!). You just need to expect it, have positive attitude, gather data, shut it down according to your predefined criteria, and get back to a drawing board.

110,2021-05-24,algotrading,"Recently I've been thinking about developing a backtesting framework based on `ib_insync`, but leveraging Cython and C++ to get rid of the Python overhead as much as possible.

A bit of background: I am software developer specializing in automating my clients’ trading strategies with Interactive Brokers API in Python. I am not a professional trader, or even a hobbyist for that matter, which is why your opinions will be so valuable to me.

In the first step, I am thinking of basically making a perfect copy of `ib_insync` in C++ and exposing to Python with Cython. The goal would be to enable Python developers to write their code either in Cython or Python and be able to seamlessly switch between `ib_insync` and this library with just one line of code in your `main.py`.

The next step would then be to implement Cython tools around that library that will help with backtesting. The idea is that you develop your code for live trading and then just run it with the backtesting harness without having to change your live-ready code at all (no work duplication and not having to maintain two versions). The advantage of this is, again, removing the Python overhead. The speed gain here will be important since, to achieve it, the backtesting will have to run a loop that feeds your algo the historical data candle by candle (or trade by trade) and there will be no vectorizing with `numpy`, all of which is extremely slow in Python.

The final step is build optimization algorithms (genetic algorithms, etc) that leverage all this functionality to optimize your algorithm’s parameters.

More on the technical side, I've been thinking about this setup for some time, and I think I have the C components I will need to make this happen. For I/O, it’s possible to use the async [POSIX.1b standard](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Asynchronous-I_002fO.html), [this little library](https://github.com/naasking/async.h/tree/master/async) mimics Python’s `asyncio`, and [this one](http://www.wangafu.net/~nickm/libevent-book/) can be a replacement for `eventkit`.

As mentioned in the beginning, curious to know your thoughts on this. Do you think that would be useful or not really? Why? One reason I’m thinking it might be an overkill is perhaps most tick-based strategies are backtested on small time periods, while it’s the buy-and-hold strategies that will be tested on the longer periods of time, meaning that the size of the backtest would be fairly small in either case.

**Edit:** A couple of you have pointed out there is no need for C++ type of speeds when dealing with the IB API. Very true. I am only considering providing it since, to enable proper C++/Cython optimization in the backtesting portion of the project, I would have to still re-write `ib_insync`'s data classes so as to skip Python checks when passing around things like `Trade` objects. From there, it won't be much more work to provide the rest of the framework as well.",nk2uw6,[],0

I hope everyone is having a great day today!  I've been pondering an issue, and I was wondering if there was some sort of convention, or what methods you all might have been successful with when it comes to averaging window size vs frequency of the underlying equity's movement.

So, nearly every algorithm that I've coded uses some form of averaging or measurement over a defined window (number of cycles 15 seconds, minute, hour, etc.).  When trading manually, I usually change these periods to match the current movement in the underlying that I'm trading.  Of course, what works best on one day, isn't what will work best at another point in time.  If you averages are too slow, and the frequency of the underlying moves faster, you end up slow to pull the trigger, and you buy high, and sell low.  When you are using to small of period, you can hop in and out of an otherwise great up trend =losing money.

For my bots, I usually manually adjust these until they are good, and then I use a series of nested for loops (Python) to run through all of the different combinations to tune the algorithm to the best performance.  Based on the time period you tune it over it makes a huge difference.  What works best over a five year period, might really suck it for months in a row, but make up for it during big run ups.  If you choose a bear cycle, it won't perform well for bull.  ...and on and on.

I usually choose a fairly short window to run my optimization (as outlined above), and do have the bot do this regularly and adjust.  My thoughts are that this keeps it in step with the current conditions. 

What I've been thinking about lately is to try and perform a Fourier Analysis to determine the strongest frequency of the underlying, and corelate the tuning with that.  I'm assuming that most every strategy uses time window based analysis at it's core, so this is something that should also plague and bot.  So what types of remediation do you guys use for accounting for this.  I guess you could just choose a steady equity with less chop, but for those who trade momentum on higher volatility equities, what have you found that works?

Thanks in advance for any conversation around this!  I really appreciate this community, and I love when there is good debate on techniques.

I'm also *not* looking for instructions on how to *get* structured event data, I'm trying to figure out how traders can work with already existing event data.  

I'm looking for

 - information & terminology on this approach (there must be a proper name?)
 - general strategies for consuming this type of data
 - specific formats that are commonly used 

I'm happy to dive into any books, source code, whatever resource or other jumping off point that might be helpful. 

For context, I'm building a crypto intelligence platform - basically it aggregates meta-information from many sources (source repositories, social accounts, blogs, forums, governance) into a structured feed of events (releases, partnerships, listings). This has the massive advantage of low latency & great coverage compared to human-curated feeds. I'm exploring how this might be used by trading systems, but I'm completely green in that regard. 

TLDR: I have structured event data that seems relevant for trading, how can I get it to traders most effectively?

242,2021-05-18,algotrading,"I have always been curious about game theory, but have been to intimidated to try to learn it. This week, I have decided to try and shake my fear and begin to learn about some basic principles in game theory:

I am looking at this basic problem in game theory that asks how should the owner of a company split the profits between her and her workers:

https://imgur.com/a/aDa5jiE

I am having some difficulty in understanding the notations:

1) "" Formally, a coalitional game is defined as: There is a set N (of n players) and a function and a function v that maps subsets of players to the real numbers: v : 2^N -> R , where v(""empty set"") = 0""

a ) Why does "" v : 2^N ""? Is the point of this expression to show all the possible interactions that can exist between any groups of players? 

b) When considering the ""value function"" (i.e. ""v"") , why does v (""empty set"") = 0? I guess this is an obvious statement, but is it supposed to mean that the potential value of the interaction between ""no players"" (i.e. the empty set) is ""0""?

2) Now, the problem where the owner of a company split the profits between her and her workers:

- The owner is represented by the symbol ""o""
- There are ""m"" number of workers (w1, w2, w3 ... wm)
- Each worker contributes an amount ""p"" to the profit

I am having difficulty understanding how the ""value function"" for this problem is determined:

The value function for the coalition of players (the coalition is denoted by ""S"") is:

- v(S) = mp, if the owner is included in the coalition 
- v(S) = 0, if the owner is not included in the coalition 

My question: How are v(S) = mp and v(S) = 0 initially determined? Or are these values assumed?

3) In this question, ""m"" is defined both as ""the number of workers"" as well as the cardinality of : S / {o} .

I have generally heard ""cardinality"" referred to as the ""size of a set"". What exactly does cardinality mean in this question? Are you supposed to be able to compute "" S / {o} ""? Why does ""S / {o}"" = m?

4) Can someone please walk me through the calculations? Why according to the Shapley values, should the profit be distributed such that: the owner receive ""mp/2"" and each worker receive ""p/2""? 

5) Lastly : Why is this question important? Is the point of this question to show ""the fairest distribution of profits according to contributions""?

Thanks

So far I had little success because of high fees and low price volatility. The main problem is that if I hold some asset for more than 30 seconds it becomes unreasonable because the bot itself cant see that far into the future.

I know that HFT is a thing but in my case its about 250ms latency so its not that.

So before I spend another 60hours on this, since I have little experience in finance I want to know: does trading high volatility stocks make sense on intervals 30sec or less, or the profit will not cover transaction fees and Im better off developing longer period strategies?

So far I did binance using real time orderbook data, 0.01% fees, +0.02% take profit and -0.1% stop loss.

I'm a programmer with about 15 years of experience and I've already written an application in C# that scrapes stocks and automatically places orders through an API. This all works well. The issue I'm experiencing is that I'm trying to make an intelligent machine that will make the decision to Buy, Sell, or Hold on every 1 second interval.

I've done a loooooot of research into ML the past three months and I'm currently using Google's Tensorflow to try and create an Agent that can do this. I'm having varying degrees of success

My first model was a modified DQN ( [https://github.com/benjamin-dupuis/DQN-snake](https://github.com/benjamin-dupuis/DQN-snake)) It was kind of close, but I just couldn't get a reliable sell to occur. It buys, and holds well, but the sell is unreliable.

I then discovered the Multi Armed Bandit model ([https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/bandits\_tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/bandits_tutorial)) and that sounded a little bit closer. I used some of Googles samples to build an MAB using a couple of different types: Linear Stochastic and a Drifting Stochastic. Neither worked quite as well as I hoped either.

Has anyone had good experience with autotrading using a specific DQN or MAB model? I'm wondering if I'm expecting too much from machine learning...  

My features are AskPrice, BidePrice, Delta (change in Ask Price over last reading), IsInvested (1 or 0), Profit ( -1 if invested, else ranges from -1 to 1).  

I'm using both positive and negative rewards. It seems I get the most variance in my results when adjusting reward patterns.

https://www.quant-investing.com/blogs/general/2015/02/16/truths-about-stop-losses-that-nobody-wants-to-believe

This article suggests that a 20% stop loss is best to use, because the 5, 10, etc stop you out too soon. Lower stop-losses tend to offset and major losses in a short period, but over a long term they are wildly less profitable. I was curious if anyone else had found the same?

Here's my backtests:

Over 1,500 trades a 10% stop-loss would net me a 1.35% return (per 100% of my account traded).

Over the same 1,500 trades a 20% stop-loss would net me a 2.3% return (per 100% of my account traded).

Now, I'm not suggesting that 1,500 trades is a good back test. I would probably aim for a number closer to 10,000. However, the article tested this method over 85 years! Using my specific test as an example, I was very surprised to find such a wild difference in profit. I was curious if anyone else has had similar results? If so, why do you think this is?


Note: I only throw about 10% of my account at any single trade. So if a 20% stop loss did occur, it would be a 2% hit on my overall account which aligns with the following article:

260,2021-05-19,algotrading,"TD Ameritrade's API is very popular for those of us that are interested in trying to build their own trading tools. The TDA API is also nice in that it supports option trading and is a good source of data for current option chains. However, the method used, get\_options\_chain, returns a JSON object that has a pretty complicated structure. It's a nested dictionary that mixes dicts and lists, where (at least) one of the lists has a single member that is a dict (at least that is how Python views it).

I really struggled to deal with it, and the only way I found to completely decompose it to (key, value) pairs was to use recursion. To save others the pain I went through, I created a GitHub repo with a couple of examples that will:

* Print out on your console every key/value pair in the get\_options\_chain JSON object
* Write the retrieved JSON object to a JSON file on your local machine.

It's currently generating income for me and my partners and neither of us work for hedge funds or anything, mostly just part time work accumulating over a few years. We started with promising manual strategies and added more automation as we went along.

This algorithm monitors a few thousand symbols, mostly US and CA stocks and executes anywhere between 1-30 trades per day, almost every day but with more activity around quarterly reporting.

The strategy to generate the signals uses a few ML models trained on historical data over the past few years on data extracted from Thomson Reuters, as well as on our own proprietary formulas (in total, a few hundred features we deem most important are used in training).

For trade execution, we wrote our own software in .NET interfacing with IBKR. Machine learning is almost all Python.

For backtesting, we use QuantConnect as well as some in-house built software. This is mostly to try optimize certain parameters (entry/exit times, allocations, ...).

Here are the results from my actual IBKR account so far this year:

Basically I was frustrated how shitty the sec’s api is and how there is no defined format for a lot of forms which makes it very difficult to algorithmically use the data.

269,2021-05-20,algotrading,"Hi everyone,

for a grad level Machine Learning Class I recently completed, I built a decision tree to predict whether  a stock from the 30 companies in the DOW would return 0.5% or more by end of a week using the previous 6 weeks of data.

Our data was limited to the 2011 Q1 and Q2 Dataset, and just included Weekly stock price, volume, days to dividend, and % dividend. we trained on Q1 and tested on Q2.  We found our tree performed best using an RSI indicator, MACD indicator, Previous Week Price Change, previous 6 Week price change, days to dividend, and % dividend return.

Moving forward, despite overfitting with too many parameters being a constant theme that people warn about (with good reason I'm sure), I'd like to try building some huge trees/neural networks using just about as many attributes as possible and then start eliminating those that seem to do more harm than good.

Like before I will be choosing from the DOW, but I'll be incorporating other factors.  Previously my only live Algotrading has been with crypto, and frankly has been very frustrating.  I've learned how TA indicators really are just a little better than a coinflip, and there are much fewer attributes to incorporate with Cryptos as opposed to an actual stock in a company.  Hence why I'd like to try incorporating as many attributes as possible since I've felt really limited to just TA indicators with crypto trading.  

I've listed all the parameters I want to start pulling data for below, but please add any that I have not thought of.  Please feel free to give any advice on how to best apply these indicators (eg, how long of a moving average should I use for tracking Number of Mentions in Social Media? 2 days? Hourly? Weekly?....)  Also feel free to point out if any of my suggested attributes are particularly important or totally useless.  Thanks so much for any insight! It will save me countless hours working with data that winds up being completely useless

&#x200B;

Currently, the list of params I think I would be useful and want to incorporate:

1) Use of 2-3 Technical Indicators at Most 

 \-> This is probably my biggest concern.  From what I've read on here, using multiple TA to make a tree  or neural network is essentially just mutating the same data over and over again, which doesn't produce distinctly different attributes that will improve prediction accuracy

\->That being said, I would think 2-3 TA indicators can help establish a positive market trend , and define whether the trend is long or short term (eg 2 week avg is above 200 day avg, and a positive MACD, I would consider a valuable set of attributes that Stock is Bullish). 

2) P/E Ratio.  This an obvious useful tool for company fundamentals.  

3) Related Raw Materials Costs (e.g. my neighbor works at a Brewing Company and mentioned how high aluminum costs and no bars pouring drafts means more canning, which has been cutting into profits despite record sales)

4) Overall Market Trend (is DOW/S&P bearish or bullish)

5) Relationship to Similar Companies (e.g. is Coke lagging behind Pepsi? Do we expect Coke to Rise or Pepsi to Crash, or both?)

6) Scan internet for major News Outlet Mentions (e.g. Did Jim Cramer recommend on his show?)

7)  Sentiment Analysis and Popularity Growth from Reddit,Twitter (is it increasing or decreasing? Is sentiment mostly positive?)

8) VIX to incorporate risk due to volatility, help define higher/lower bail thresholds

9) Strike Prices and Expirations Dates of Puts/Calls (essentially applying the Max Pain strategy where major Hedge Funds that sell options try to manipulate prices to not go above/below a certain range to ensure the vast majority of options expire worthless.)

10) Depth Charts to view major sell/buy walls

11) Days to Dividend, % Dividend Return

&#x200B;

\*As  a side note, I wanted to mention that I've found Volume to be completely useless attribute, but perhaps I'm not using it right.  Even if I'm able to see if most of the buying is Maker side (which is not always available info), I already can tell because the price is increasing, as one would expect.  The price and Buy Volume I've found are essentially just the same data, if buy volume increases, price increases proportionally.  The only strat I've heard that uses volume that sort of makes sense is that big money Firms tend to increase volume substantially, while keeping price as unchanged as possible, and eventually reduce supply until price eventually does jump.  Other than that, I've yet to find a way to use volume effectively, but please let me know if I'm completely missing something here.

If this value is below a certain threshold, then look at the next day’s return (Close to Close).

I simulated different threshold values from 5 to 100 to measure the likelihood of the next day being a positive day and found that when the price closes nearer the low, the next day is more likely to be an up day (The x axis on the chart is the threshold and the y axis is the likelihood of the next day being an up day)

11. Know your costs / feasibility of fills. Run live experiments.
12. Make first automation bare-bones, your strategy will likely fail anyway
13. Top reasons why your strategy will fail: incorrect (a) test (b) data (c) costs/execution assumptions or (d) inability to take a trade. Incorporate those into your validation process
14. Be sceptical of test results with less than 1000 trades
15. Be sceptical of test results covering one market cycle
16. No single strategy work for all market conditions, know your favorable conditions and have realistic expectations
17. Good strategy is the one that works well during favorable conditions and doesn't lose too much while waiting for them
18. Holy grail of trading is running multiple non-correlated strategies specializing on different market conditions
19. Know your expected Max DD. Expect live Max DD be 2x of your worst backtest
20. Don't go down the rabbit hole of thinking learning a new language/framework will help your trading. Generally it doesn't with rare exceptions
21. Increase your trading capital gradually as you gain confidence in your method
22. Once you are trading live, don't obsess over $ fluctuations. It's mostly noise that will keep you distracted
23. Only 2 things matter when running live - (a) if your model=backtest staying within expected parameters (b) if your live executions are matching your model
24. Know when to shutdown your system
25. Individual trade outcome doesn't matter

**PS**. As I started writing this, I realized how long this list can become and that it could use categorizing. Hopefully it helps the way it is. Tried to cover different parts of the journey.

Edit 1: My post received way more attention than I anticipated. Thanks everyone. Based on some comments people made I would like to clarify if I wasn't clear. This post is not about ""setting up your first trading bot"". My own first took me one weekend to write and I launched it live following Monday, that part is really not a big deal, relatively to everything else afterwards. I'm talking about becoming consistently profitable trading live for a meaningful amount of time (at least couple of years). Withstanding non favorable conditions. It's much more than just writing your first bot. And I almost guarantee you, your first strategy is gonna fail live (or you're truly a genius!). You just need to expect it, have positive attitude, gather data, shut it down according to your predefined criteria, and get back to a drawing board. And, of course, look at the list above, see if you're making any of those mistakes 😉",njcquf,[],0

Your head is spinning, the bot did horribly! You're questioning everything you once thought was true; double, triple-checking your lines of code to see what went wrong or what was accidentally changed or deleted or added. To your dismay, the code is ""fine."" You're trying to figure out if it was slippage, delays, failures to fill limit orders, or what...  


It hits you. Your strategy sucks ass. It doesn't work, and you realize you need to go back to the drawing board. You're also realizing that you started on the initial backtesting project over a year ago and that's where most of your time and effort was spent; you're questioning whether to even change your code because you're considering how long it would take to start backtesting a new strategy and then how long till you actually get to test this new strategy for real like you did today to see if it even works. You're so frustrated you grab a rock and smash your computer with it; the monitor falls off the desk and the screen cracks into a spiderweb manifesting every backtest you ever backtested, but in each shard of glass you can see a small window into your soul, a reflection of yourself in a parallel reality--a prehistoric caveman who backtested himself into a corner by his own fate.

* Which symbols are leading the divergence (I could trade both, but this eats into profit);
* Which direction to trade to take advantage of any re-convergence (this is easy manually when looking at the graphs but more difficult in the code);  and
* Which symbols to trade (count of times each symbol is leading a divergence in the same direction).

310,2021-05-24,algotrading,"Recently I've been thinking about developing a backtesting framework based on `ib_insync`, but leveraging Cython and C++ to get rid of the Python overhead as much as possible.

A bit of background: I am software developer specializing in automating my clients’ trading strategies with Interactive Brokers API in Python. I am not a professional trader, or even a hobbyist for that matter, which is why your opinions will be so valuable to me.

In the first step, I am thinking of basically making a perfect copy of `ib_insync` in C++ and exposing to Python with Cython. The goal would be to enable Python developers to write their code either in Cython or Python and be able to seamlessly switch between `ib_insync` and this library with just one line of code in your `main.py`.

The next step would then be to implement Cython tools around that library that will help with backtesting. The idea is that you develop your code for live trading and then just run it with the backtesting harness without having to change your live-ready code at all (no work duplication and not having to maintain two versions). The advantage of this is, again, removing the Python overhead. The speed gain here will be important since, to achieve it, the backtesting will have to run a loop that feeds your algo the historical data candle by candle (or trade by trade) and there will be no vectorizing with `numpy`, all of which is extremely slow in Python.

The final step is build optimization algorithms (genetic algorithms, etc) that leverage all this functionality to optimize your algorithm’s parameters.

More on the technical side, I've been thinking about this setup for some time, and I think I have the C components I will need to make this happen. For I/O, it’s possible to use the async [POSIX.1b standard](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Asynchronous-I_002fO.html), [this little library](https://github.com/naasking/async.h/tree/master/async) mimics Python’s `asyncio`, and [this one](http://www.wangafu.net/~nickm/libevent-book/) can be a replacement for `eventkit`.

As mentioned in the beginning, curious to know your thoughts on this. Do you think that would be useful or not really? Why? One reason I’m thinking it might be an overkill is perhaps most tick-based strategies are backtested on small time periods, while it’s the buy-and-hold strategies that will be tested on the longer periods of time, meaning that the size of the backtest would be fairly small in either case.

**Edit:** A couple of you have pointed out there is no need for C++ type of speeds when dealing with the IB API. Very true. I am only considering providing it since, to enable proper C++/Cython optimization in the backtesting portion of the project, I would have to still re-write `ib_insync`'s data classes so as to skip Python checks when passing around things like `Trade` objects. From there, it won't be much more work to provide the rest of the framework as well.",nk2uw6,[],0

395,2021-05-25,algotrading,"Hello,

I hope everyone is having a great day today!  I've been pondering an issue, and I was wondering if there was some sort of convention, or what methods you all might have been successful with when it comes to averaging window size vs frequency of the underlying equity's movement.

So, nearly every algorithm that I've coded uses some form of averaging or measurement over a defined window (number of cycles 15 seconds, minute, hour, etc.).  When trading manually, I usually change these periods to match the current movement in the underlying that I'm trading.  Of course, what works best on one day, isn't what will work best at another point in time.  If you averages are too slow, and the frequency of the underlying moves faster, you end up slow to pull the trigger, and you buy high, and sell low.  When you are using to small of period, you can hop in and out of an otherwise great up trend =losing money.

For my bots, I usually manually adjust these until they are good, and then I use a series of nested for loops (Python) to run through all of the different combinations to tune the algorithm to the best performance.  Based on the time period you tune it over it makes a huge difference.  What works best over a five year period, might really suck it for months in a row, but make up for it during big run ups.  If you choose a bear cycle, it won't perform well for bull.  ...and on and on.

I usually choose a fairly short window to run my optimization (as outlined above), and do have the bot do this regularly and adjust.  My thoughts are that this keeps it in step with the current conditions. 

What I've been thinking about lately is to try and perform a Fourier Analysis to determine the strongest frequency of the underlying, and corelate the tuning with that.  I'm assuming that most every strategy uses time window based analysis at it's core, so this is something that should also plague and bot.  So what types of remediation do you guys use for accounting for this.  I guess you could just choose a steady equity with less chop, but for those who trade momentum on higher volatility equities, what have you found that works?

Thanks in advance for any conversation around this!  I really appreciate this community, and I love when there is good debate on techniques.

Hi all

I want to try out some simple trading strategies (buy selected shares when they decrease around x% and sell if increase by y%).

Now 2 questions:

1. How  can I automate this? I basically want to select around 20-50 shares and  a bot/algorithm buys any of those, that decreased by a percentage that I  can select. (don't have much programming knowledge) I don't know Python, but as it seems like a simple automation, are there any websites/apps that allow this? If possible in Europe
2. How can I test this?

698,2021-05-18,algotrading,"New here. Some python and matlab experience, interested in finance. 

I have an idea which revolves around exploring options chain pricing inefficiencies (assuming my math is correct).

In order for my idea to work I need to design a system which can monitor options prices of a handful of companies with large options chains. I have written a matlab script which can take in option spread information along with the stocks variance metric and let me know if there is a likely profitable trade. I won’t go into the specifics here, what I have made is not perfect.

Ideally this would then run over the course of trading days and notify me of any opportunities it see. 

In order for this to work, I need to be able to run my code continuously and retrieve up to date option chain data which can be fed into my script. Is the best way to get this data to physically data scrape financial sites, or are there any python api or packages that would work better? I have seen mixed results and am wondering if anyone here has experience they’d like to share. Ideally any API’s would be free as I am a poor college student at the moment.

699,2021-05-18,algotrading,"Hello everyone. I'm a programmer with about 15 years of experience and I've already written an application in C# that scrapes stocks and automatically places orders through an API. This all works well. The issue I'm experiencing is that I'm trying to make an intelligent machine that will make the decision to Buy, Sell, or Hold on every 1 second interval.

I've done a loooooot of research into ML the past three months and I'm currently using Google's Tensorflow to try and create an Agent that can do this. I'm having varying degrees of success

My first model was a modified DQN ( [https://github.com/benjamin-dupuis/DQN-snake](https://github.com/benjamin-dupuis/DQN-snake)) It was kind of close, but I just couldn't get a reliable sell to occur. It buys, and holds well, but the sell is unreliable.

I then discovered the Multi Armed Bandit model ([https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/bandits\_tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/bandits_tutorial)) and that sounded a little bit closer. I used some of Googles samples to build an MAB using a couple of different types: Linear Stochastic and a Drifting Stochastic. Neither worked quite as well as I hoped either.

Has anyone had good experience with autotrading using a specific DQN or MAB model? I'm wondering if I'm expecting too much from machine learning...  

My features are AskPrice, BidePrice, Delta (change in Ask Price over last reading), IsInvested (1 or 0), Profit ( -1 if invested, else ranges from -1 to 1).  

I'm using both positive and negative rewards. It seems I get the most variance in my results when adjusting reward patterns.

https://www.quant-investing.com/blogs/general/2015/02/16/truths-about-stop-losses-that-nobody-wants-to-believe

This article suggests that a 20% stop loss is best to use, because the 5, 10, etc stop you out too soon. Lower stop-losses tend to offset and major losses in a short period, but over a long term they are wildly less profitable. I was curious if anyone else had found the same?

Here's my backtests:

Over 1,500 trades a 10% stop-loss would net me a 1.35% return (per 100% of my account traded).

Over the same 1,500 trades a 20% stop-loss would net me a 2.3% return (per 100% of my account traded).

Now, I'm not suggesting that 1,500 trades is a good back test. I would probably aim for a number closer to 10,000. However, the article tested this method over 85 years! Using my specific test as an example, I was very surprised to find such a wild difference in profit. I was curious if anyone else has had similar results? If so, why do you think this is?


Note: I only throw about 10% of my account at any single trade. So if a 20% stop loss did occur, it would be a 2% hit on my overall account which aligns with the following article:

710,2021-05-19,algotrading,"TD Ameritrade's API is very popular for those of us that are interested in trying to build their own trading tools. The TDA API is also nice in that it supports option trading and is a good source of data for current option chains. However, the method used, get\_options\_chain, returns a JSON object that has a pretty complicated structure. It's a nested dictionary that mixes dicts and lists, where (at least) one of the lists has a single member that is a dict (at least that is how Python views it).

I really struggled to deal with it, and the only way I found to completely decompose it to (key, value) pairs was to use recursion. To save others the pain I went through, I created a GitHub repo with a couple of examples that will:

* Print out on your console every key/value pair in the get\_options\_chain JSON object
* Write the retrieved JSON object to a JSON file on your local machine.

It's currently generating income for me and my partners and neither of us work for hedge funds or anything, mostly just part time work accumulating over a few years. We started with promising manual strategies and added more automation as we went along.

This algorithm monitors a few thousand symbols, mostly US and CA stocks and executes anywhere between 1-30 trades per day, almost every day but with more activity around quarterly reporting.

The strategy to generate the signals uses a few ML models trained on historical data over the past few years on data extracted from Thomson Reuters, as well as on our own proprietary formulas (in total, a few hundred features we deem most important are used in training).

For trade execution, we wrote our own software in .NET interfacing with IBKR. Machine learning is almost all Python.

For backtesting, we use QuantConnect as well as some in-house built software. This is mostly to try optimize certain parameters (entry/exit times, allocations, ...).

719,2021-05-20,algotrading,"Hi everyone,

for a grad level Machine Learning Class I recently completed, I built a decision tree to predict whether  a stock from the 30 companies in the DOW would return 0.5% or more by end of a week using the previous 6 weeks of data.

Our data was limited to the 2011 Q1 and Q2 Dataset, and just included Weekly stock price, volume, days to dividend, and % dividend. we trained on Q1 and tested on Q2.  We found our tree performed best using an RSI indicator, MACD indicator, Previous Week Price Change, previous 6 Week price change, days to dividend, and % dividend return.

Moving forward, despite overfitting with too many parameters being a constant theme that people warn about (with good reason I'm sure), I'd like to try building some huge trees/neural networks using just about as many attributes as possible and then start eliminating those that seem to do more harm than good.

Like before I will be choosing from the DOW, but I'll be incorporating other factors.  Previously my only live Algotrading has been with crypto, and frankly has been very frustrating.  I've learned how TA indicators really are just a little better than a coinflip, and there are much fewer attributes to incorporate with Cryptos as opposed to an actual stock in a company.  Hence why I'd like to try incorporating as many attributes as possible since I've felt really limited to just TA indicators with crypto trading.  

I've listed all the parameters I want to start pulling data for below, but please add any that I have not thought of.  Please feel free to give any advice on how to best apply these indicators (eg, how long of a moving average should I use for tracking Number of Mentions in Social Media? 2 days? Hourly? Weekly?....)  Also feel free to point out if any of my suggested attributes are particularly important or totally useless.  Thanks so much for any insight! It will save me countless hours working with data that winds up being completely useless

&#x200B;

Currently, the list of params I think I would be useful and want to incorporate:

1) Use of 2-3 Technical Indicators at Most 

 \-> This is probably my biggest concern.  From what I've read on here, using multiple TA to make a tree  or neural network is essentially just mutating the same data over and over again, which doesn't produce distinctly different attributes that will improve prediction accuracy

\->That being said, I would think 2-3 TA indicators can help establish a positive market trend , and define whether the trend is long or short term (eg 2 week avg is above 200 day avg, and a positive MACD, I would consider a valuable set of attributes that Stock is Bullish). 

2) P/E Ratio.  This an obvious useful tool for company fundamentals.  

3) Related Raw Materials Costs (e.g. my neighbor works at a Brewing Company and mentioned how high aluminum costs and no bars pouring drafts means more canning, which has been cutting into profits despite record sales)

4) Overall Market Trend (is DOW/S&P bearish or bullish)

5) Relationship to Similar Companies (e.g. is Coke lagging behind Pepsi? Do we expect Coke to Rise or Pepsi to Crash, or both?)

6) Scan internet for major News Outlet Mentions (e.g. Did Jim Cramer recommend on his show?)

7)  Sentiment Analysis and Popularity Growth from Reddit,Twitter (is it increasing or decreasing? Is sentiment mostly positive?)

8) VIX to incorporate risk due to volatility, help define higher/lower bail thresholds

9) Strike Prices and Expirations Dates of Puts/Calls (essentially applying the Max Pain strategy where major Hedge Funds that sell options try to manipulate prices to not go above/below a certain range to ensure the vast majority of options expire worthless.)

10) Depth Charts to view major sell/buy walls

11) Days to Dividend, % Dividend Return

&#x200B;

\*As  a side note, I wanted to mention that I've found Volume to be completely useless attribute, but perhaps I'm not using it right.  Even if I'm able to see if most of the buying is Maker side (which is not always available info), I already can tell because the price is increasing, as one would expect.  The price and Buy Volume I've found are essentially just the same data, if buy volume increases, price increases proportionally.  The only strat I've heard that uses volume that sort of makes sense is that big money Firms tend to increase volume substantially, while keeping price as unchanged as possible, and eventually reduce supply until price eventually does jump.  Other than that, I've yet to find a way to use volume effectively, but please let me know if I'm completely missing something here.

737,2021-05-21,algotrading,"I’ve been backtesting a simple strategy that looks to see if a close price near the day’s low is followed by an up day. I calculate the daily range and check where within that range the price closed as a percentage. i.e. a value of 25% means the close was within the bottom 25% of the day’s range. If this value is below a certain threshold, then look at the next day’s return (Close to Close).

I simulated different threshold values from 5 to 100 to measure the likelihood of the next day being a positive day and found that when the price closes nearer the low, the next day is more likely to be an up day (The x axis on the chart is the threshold and the y axis is the likelihood of the next day being an up day)

I then backtested this as a simple system (no fees etc accounted for) on a few different indices, which showed excess returns and improved drawdowns. The only trading rule was, if the price closes within the bottom 20% of the day's range then go long and exit at the next day's close.

It's much more than just writing your first bot. And I almost guarantee you, your first strategy is gonna fail live (or you're truly a genius!).

760,2021-05-24,algotrading,"Recently I've been thinking about developing a backtesting framework based on `ib_insync`, but leveraging Cython and C++ to get rid of the Python overhead as much as possible.

A bit of background: I am software developer specializing in automating my clients’ trading strategies with Interactive Brokers API in Python. I am not a professional trader, or even a hobbyist for that matter, which is why your opinions will be so valuable to me.

In the first step, I am thinking of basically making a perfect copy of `ib_insync` in C++ and exposing to Python with Cython. The goal would be to enable Python developers to write their code either in Cython or Python and be able to seamlessly switch between `ib_insync` and this library with just one line of code in your `main.py`.

The next step would then be to implement Cython tools around that library that will help with backtesting. The idea is that you develop your code for live trading and then just run it with the backtesting harness without having to change your live-ready code at all (no work duplication and not having to maintain two versions). The advantage of this is, again, removing the Python overhead. The speed gain here will be important since, to achieve it, the backtesting will have to run a loop that feeds your algo the historical data candle by candle (or trade by trade) and there will be no vectorizing with `numpy`, all of which is extremely slow in Python.

The final step is build optimization algorithms (genetic algorithms, etc) that leverage all this functionality to optimize your algorithm’s parameters.

More on the technical side, I've been thinking about this setup for some time, and I think I have the C components I will need to make this happen. For I/O, it’s possible to use the async [POSIX.1b standard](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Asynchronous-I_002fO.html), [this little library](https://github.com/naasking/async.h/tree/master/async) mimics Python’s `asyncio`, and [this one](http://www.wangafu.net/~nickm/libevent-book/) can be a replacement for `eventkit`.

As mentioned in the beginning, curious to know your thoughts on this. Do you think that would be useful or not really? Why? One reason I’m thinking it might be an overkill is perhaps most tick-based strategies are backtested on small time periods, while it’s the buy-and-hold strategies that will be tested on the longer periods of time, meaning that the size of the backtest would be fairly small in either case.

**Edit:** A couple of you have pointed out there is no need for C++ type of speeds when dealing with the IB API. Very true. I am only considering providing it since, to enable proper C++/Cython optimization in the backtesting portion of the project, I would have to still re-write `ib_insync`'s data classes so as to skip Python checks when passing around things like `Trade` objects. From there, it won't be much more work to provide the rest of the framework as well.",nk2uw6,[],0

775,2021-05-25,algotrading,"Hello,

I hope everyone is having a great day today!  I've been pondering an issue, and I was wondering if there was some sort of convention, or what methods you all might have been successful with when it comes to averaging window size vs frequency of the underlying equity's movement.

So, nearly every algorithm that I've coded uses some form of averaging or measurement over a defined window (number of cycles 15 seconds, minute, hour, etc.).  When trading manually, I usually change these periods to match the current movement in the underlying that I'm trading.  Of course, what works best on one day, isn't what will work best at another point in time.  If you averages are too slow, and the frequency of the underlying moves faster, you end up slow to pull the trigger, and you buy high, and sell low.  When you are using to small of period, you can hop in and out of an otherwise great up trend =losing money.

For my bots, I usually manually adjust these until they are good, and then I use a series of nested for loops (Python) to run through all of the different combinations to tune the algorithm to the best performance.  Based on the time period you tune it over it makes a huge difference.  What works best over a five year period, might really suck it for months in a row, but make up for it during big run ups.  If you choose a bear cycle, it won't perform well for bull.  ...and on and on.

I usually choose a fairly short window to run my optimization (as outlined above), and do have the bot do this regularly and adjust.  My thoughts are that this keeps it in step with the current conditions. 

What I've been thinking about lately is to try and perform a Fourier Analysis to determine the strongest frequency of the underlying, and corelate the tuning with that.  I'm assuming that most every strategy uses time window based analysis at it's core, so this is something that should also plague and bot.  So what types of remediation do you guys use for accounting for this.  I guess you could just choose a steady equity with less chop, but for those who trade momentum on higher volatility equities, what have you found that works?

Thanks in advance for any conversation around this!  I really appreciate this community, and I love when there is good debate on techniques.

Before the ""everyone is a genius in a bull market"" - I know. Besides, this strategy has been backtested to 1928. Here's the original quant paper: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=2741701](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2741701)

# TL;DR

Returned 56% compounding annually, including \~45% during 2020. Max drawdown a (nerve-wracking) 55.6%. Automatically trades \~1x per quarter, for every ""losing trade"", it makes 2.3 ""winning trades"". For comparison with the market, it has a risk-adjusted return (via the Sharpe ratio) of 1.83 vs the S&P \~0.4. Needless to say: this strategy is high risk. How to run it yourself - if still interested - below.

# How it works

This strategy utilizes 3x leveraged funds. They track the S&P, but each day they leverage 3x, so in a day you get 3x the return of the S&P (whether it goes up or down). These get a bad wrap because of volatility drag (sideways markets or those with rapid price changes eat the gains as the fund re-leverages each day) and their drawdowns, and are consequently mainly recommended only for day-trading (and not for long-term holds). Recommend you do your own research here to make sure you understand the risks.

Beyond that it's very simple: when the S&P is above its 200 day moving average price, hold UPRO (a 3x leveraged fund). When the S&P is below its 200 day moving average price, rotate to cash.

# Performance

**Quick stats (1928 - 2015):**

\- Annual return: 26.8%

\- Sharpe ratio: 0.4 (vs S&P 0.3)

\- Max drawdown: -92.2% (yikes)

\- Avg trades per year: 5

**Quick stats (2009 - 2021):**

\- Annual return: 56.16%

\- Sharpe ratio: 1.83 (vs S&P 0.4)

\- Max drawdown: -55.60%

https://www.quant-investing.com/blogs/general/2015/02/16/truths-about-stop-losses-that-nobody-wants-to-believe

This article suggests that a 20% stop loss is best to use, because the 5, 10, etc stop you out too soon. Lower stop-losses tend to offset and major losses in a short period, but over a long term they are wildly less profitable. I was curious if anyone else had found the same?

Here's my backtests:

Over 1,500 trades a 10% stop-loss would net me a 1.35% return (per 100% of my account traded).

Over the same 1,500 trades a 20% stop-loss would net me a 2.3% return (per 100% of my account traded).

Now, I'm not suggesting that 1,500 trades is a good back test. I would probably aim for a number closer to 10,000. However, the article tested this method over 85 years! Using my specific test as an example, I was very surprised to find such a wild difference in profit. I was curious if anyone else has had similar results? If so, why do you think this is?


Note: I only throw about 10% of my account at any single trade. So if a 20% stop loss did occur, it would be a 2% hit on my overall account which aligns with the following article:

The TDA API is also nice in that it supports option trading and is a good source of data for current option chains.

It's a nested dictionary that mixes dicts and lists, where (at least) one of the lists has a single member that is a dict (at least that is how Python views it).

I really struggled to deal with it, and the only way I found to completely decompose it to (key, value) pairs was to use recursion. To save others the pain I went through, I created a GitHub repo with a couple of examples that will:

977,2021-05-20,algotrading,"Hi everyone,

for a grad level Machine Learning Class I recently completed, I built a decision tree to predict whether  a stock from the 30 companies in the DOW would return 0.5% or more by end of a week using the previous 6 weeks of data.

Our data was limited to the 2011 Q1 and Q2 Dataset, and just included Weekly stock price, volume, days to dividend, and % dividend. we trained on Q1 and tested on Q2.  We found our tree performed best using an RSI indicator, MACD indicator, Previous Week Price Change, previous 6 Week price change, days to dividend, and % dividend return.

Moving forward, despite overfitting with too many parameters being a constant theme that people warn about (with good reason I'm sure), I'd like to try building some huge trees/neural networks using just about as many attributes as possible and then start eliminating those that seem to do more harm than good.

Like before I will be choosing from the DOW, but I'll be incorporating other factors.  Previously my only live Algotrading has been with crypto, and frankly has been very frustrating.  I've learned how TA indicators really are just a little better than a coinflip, and there are much fewer attributes to incorporate with Cryptos as opposed to an actual stock in a company.  Hence why I'd like to try incorporating as many attributes as possible since I've felt really limited to just TA indicators with crypto trading.  

I've listed all the parameters I want to start pulling data for below, but please add any that I have not thought of.  Please feel free to give any advice on how to best apply these indicators (eg, how long of a moving average should I use for tracking Number of Mentions in Social Media? 2 days? Hourly? Weekly?....)  Also feel free to point out if any of my suggested attributes are particularly important or totally useless.  Thanks so much for any insight! It will save me countless hours working with data that winds up being completely useless

&#x200B;

Currently, the list of params I think I would be useful and want to incorporate:

1) Use of 2-3 Technical Indicators at Most 

 \-> This is probably my biggest concern.  From what I've read on here, using multiple TA to make a tree  or neural network is essentially just mutating the same data over and over again, which doesn't produce distinctly different attributes that will improve prediction accuracy

\->That being said, I would think 2-3 TA indicators can help establish a positive market trend , and define whether the trend is long or short term (eg 2 week avg is above 200 day avg, and a positive MACD, I would consider a valuable set of attributes that Stock is Bullish). 

2) P/E Ratio.  This an obvious useful tool for company fundamentals.  

3) Related Raw Materials Costs (e.g. my neighbor works at a Brewing Company and mentioned how high aluminum costs and no bars pouring drafts means more canning, which has been cutting into profits despite record sales)

4) Overall Market Trend (is DOW/S&P bearish or bullish)

5) Relationship to Similar Companies (e.g. is Coke lagging behind Pepsi? Do we expect Coke to Rise or Pepsi to Crash, or both?)

6) Scan internet for major News Outlet Mentions (e.g. Did Jim Cramer recommend on his show?)

7)  Sentiment Analysis and Popularity Growth from Reddit,Twitter (is it increasing or decreasing? Is sentiment mostly positive?)

8) VIX to incorporate risk due to volatility, help define higher/lower bail thresholds

9) Strike Prices and Expirations Dates of Puts/Calls (essentially applying the Max Pain strategy where major Hedge Funds that sell options try to manipulate prices to not go above/below a certain range to ensure the vast majority of options expire worthless.)

10) Depth Charts to view major sell/buy walls

11) Days to Dividend, % Dividend Return

&#x200B;

\*As  a side note, I wanted to mention that I've found Volume to be completely useless attribute, but perhaps I'm not using it right.  Even if I'm able to see if most of the buying is Maker side (which is not always available info), I already can tell because the price is increasing, as one would expect.  The price and Buy Volume I've found are essentially just the same data, if buy volume increases, price increases proportionally.  The only strat I've heard that uses volume that sort of makes sense is that big money Firms tend to increase volume substantially, while keeping price as unchanged as possible, and eventually reduce supply until price eventually does jump.  Other than that, I've yet to find a way to use volume effectively, but please let me know if I'm completely missing something here.

I know its nothing super special, but I figure for those who like to mess around with the data and aren't interested in getting railed in API fees maybe this will help with that :)

980,2021-05-20,algotrading,"I am a seasoned programmer, not too bad in finance and currently doing CFA, but new to setting up trading systems, so seek recommendation on my below approach.

To begin with, I need to build basic infrastructure to perform fundamental/technical analysis and signaling. My plan is to include 15-20years of fundamental data to be able to backtest in various market cycles. Along with it, I need to download historical economic data to establish better understanding on market movement and top down strategy. I am aware of yahoo finance, FRED for such data. But, I guess I need to run the downloader script at a frequency to sync new data and keep the system updated, also perform analysis and signaling. So I need a source that updates almost in real time, may be SEC filings?

Also, I need to think of scalability, to expand the system capabilities, as I progress further with my learning.

I am good with Rust, Go, Python but I see larger ecosystem in Python. I love Rust but haven't heard much success stories in this domain and I am not sure if misisng pandas/numpy/ML ecosystem will become showstopper at some stage.

Also, as per other posts in the community, I see recommendation for both Postgres/Timescaledb and mongodb for data store. I am hoping, postgres should be good to begin with.

How are you guys managing such setup? Any kind of input shall be deeply appreciated and please excuse my limited knowledge. Thank you.",nguul3,[],1

The question is, if the liquidity asset has a high IV compared to the index, can you simply normalise the high IV with lower IV and then search advance/decline % accounting for the IV? For example, asset A has a 90% IV and asset B has 30 IV. Asset A whips around and asset B does not however Asset A appears to rise or fall x days/periods prior to asset B (potentially predictive). If Asset A jumps by say 9% can you divide by 3 (90%/30%) to get likely move in asset B and test for x days till asset B moves (back testing)? Or is that too simple.

All of my logic is based on things like moving averages that should behave the same on the two stocks.

995,2021-05-21,algotrading,"I’ve been backtesting a simple strategy that looks to see if a close price near the day’s low is followed by an up day. I calculate the daily range and check where within that range the price closed as a percentage. i.e. a value of 25% means the close was within the bottom 25% of the day’s range. If this value is below a certain threshold, then look at the next day’s return (Close to Close).

I simulated different threshold values from 5 to 100 to measure the likelihood of the next day being a positive day and found that when the price closes nearer the low, the next day is more likely to be an up day (The x axis on the chart is the threshold and the y axis is the likelihood of the next day being an up day)

I then backtested this as a simple system (no fees etc accounted for) on a few different indices, which showed excess returns and improved drawdowns. The only trading rule was, if the price closes within the bottom 20% of the day's range then go long and exit at the next day's close.
