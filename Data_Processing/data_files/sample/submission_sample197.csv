Like most reddit sheeple I invested in AMC when the stonks short stuff was happening, and I had a few questions about investing in general.  Disclaimer, I also did this with no guidance or general knowledge, so I'm also still relatively clueless of the ins and outs.

I understand if I were to sell stocks within a year of me buying I will be taxed, but if I were to sell it and reinvest into another company would I still be taxed?

And If I were to make a Roth IRA account, would stocks I own be able to be in that account?

I did all of this investing through Vanguard which was told to me is a good option for investing.  And I understand that through vanguard there are a few options of how you invest through a roth ira.

Last question, I recently got a 401k with my new job and I understand that you can fund a roth IRA with a 401k, but how quickly can that happen? I don't know alot about 401ks, but I imagine they take a portion from each check to go towards retirement, and just curious if I can on a monthly basis use that to fund a roth?

Thank you, also I just want to repeat I have pretty limited knowledge on how this stuff works and I appreciate any and all help!",nm1lps,['AMC'],1

224,2021-05-27,stocks,"**Business:**

LMP Motors $LMPX 's business model as “Buy, Rent or Subscribe, Sell and Repeat.” This means that we “Buy” pre-owned automobiles primarily through auctions or directly from other automobile dealers, and new automobiles from manufacturers and manufacturer distributors at fleet rates. LMPX Rents or Subscribe” by either renting automobiles to our customers or allowing them to enter into our subscription plan for automobiles in which customers have use of an automobile for a minimum of thirty (30) days. LMPX then sells its inventory, including automobiles previously included in our rental and subscription programs, to customers, and then we hope to “Repeat” the whole process.

**IPO and Price History:**

LMPX IPO'd in December 2019 at 5$ per share and has steadily increased throughout the past 18 months, reaching a peak of $45 earlier this year. It has since retraced in price and is currently trading at $15.8. This retracement is largely due to investors believing revenue guidance for 2021 was overstated based on December 2020 Q4 revenues of 4M.

LMPX was trading at a market cap of above 350M earlier this year but has since sold off. (meets criteria to be posted on this sub)

**Revenue Growth and Forecast:**

LMPX reported 10.8m of revenues in 2019 and grew revenues to 30.4m for 2020. Representing a 180% increase in Revenues YoY.

LMPX forecasted revenues of 29m to 31m for Q1 2021 representing a 650% increase in revenues from Q4 2020.

LMPX full year 2021 revenues forecasted at 535 million

Shareholders called out the CEO on these revenues forecasts after Q4 results and the stock subsequently sold off.

**Q1 2021 Earnings Preliminary Numbers (To be reported after close tomorrow)**

LMPX quietly released its preliminary numbers last week directly to the SEC.

Reporting Revenues of $33m, representing 725% increase in revenues from the previous quarter.

Gross profit increased to 6M from 500k the previous quarter.

Cash increased of 1.4M to 19.4m through net operating cash flows.

These preliminary numbers beat the Q1 Guidance of 29M-31M by 15%.

The earnings call tomorrow will prove to shareholders and investors that this company is achieving substantial growth and the the forecasts are obtainable.

Guidance for the 2021 year is expected to increase above its 535 million to 570 million+.

**EBITDA:** EBITDA expected at 4.4% for 2021 of total revenues amounting to 25million which is to be used for repayment of loans on recent acquisitions.

**Valuation to Peers:**

**CVNA:**

Market Cap of 44.7B

Sales of 5.5B

P/S: 8.12

Revenue growth YoY: 41%

**VRM:**

Market Cap of 5.9B

Sales of 1.3B

P/S: 4.53

Revenue growth YoY: 14%

**LMPX:**

Market Cap of 158M

Sales of : 33M for Q1 (570M 2021 full year)

P/S: 0.27 (based on 2021 revenue Guidance)

Revenue growth YoY: 1766% (2020 to 2021 growth)

**LMPX** **Fair Value based on 2021 Sales:**

Market Cap: 2.5B

Share price: $256

P/S: 4.5

**Used Auto Market Growth:**

The used car market is booming, making it a perfect time for resellers. The shortage of new cars as a result of the global chip prices has demand for used cars surging.

Used car prices have jumped 21 percent since April 2020 and 10% of that came directly during April 2021.

This factor alone should drastically increase guidance for 2021 above the 535 forecast. April price jumps and demand surge will be reflected in next quarters earnings resulting in increased guidance.

**Key Acquisitions and Business Moves:**

LMPX has been making key acquisitions over the last few months which will help play into the bottom line.

**LMPX Acquisitions:**

Hometown Subaru - May 2021

2 Dodge/Chrysler Dealerships - April 2021

Bachman Bernard Chevy Buick Dealership - April 2021

New Ecommerce Website - March 2021

LTO Holdings Acquisition - February 2021

Atlantic Auto Group Acquisition - February 2021

Landed 660M syndicate credit line for use of Acquisitions - January 2021

LMPX started off the year with a bang and secured 660m of credit to use towards acquisition's. Which has been put to use over the first 5 months, purchasing multiple auto groups and dealerships. Securing backlogs of inventory and entering into new markets throughout the U.S. These acquisitions will be even more profitable with the recent 10% surge in used car prices in April 2021.

**Float:**

LMPX currently has 10.01m shares outstanding of which 4m are owned directly by management/insiders. Making the tradeable float roughly 6m. The lower the float means the quicker the price moves. Institutional holdings is low but I expect it to drastically increase after tomorrows earnings resulting in a even smaller tradeable float.

**Summary:**

LMPX will report revenues of 33M tonight representing a 725% increase from prior quarter. This will bring back investors who dumped their shares after the CEO was called out for ""overstating guidance"". This earnings report will beat expectations by 10-15% and Revenue guidance is expected to be bumped higher to the high 570 million range. New investors will be drawn in from the quarter over quarter growth reported on the call. The recent boom in used auto prices and demand will further excel LMPX as a market leader. If LMPX continues to exceed revenues estimates and obtain 550M+ revenue for 2021 its fair value compared to its peers should be at $250+ a share representing a 1582% increase from its current share price.

Get in on the ground floor before the earnings call today. LMPX ran today as investors started to catch on to the SEC filing of preliminary numbers. We should see a 20% + move after hours tomorrow and quick run back to its ATH of $45.",nm4il0,[],1

# The Balance Sheet

>A  balance sheet shows how much a company is worth, also known as the  ""book"" value. It lists the value of a company's assets, liabilities and  shareholders equity.  
Like the Income Statement, it is often shared on a quarterly or annual basis.

# Overview of whats in it

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** **https://imgur.com/WZNIuBY**

# Assets

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [**https://imgur.com/3UVsD43**](https://imgur.com/3UVsD43)   
>  
>An **asset** is defined as anything owned by a company that holds inherent, quantifiable value.

**Current assets** include anything a company expects it will convert into cash within a year, such as:

* Cash and cash equivalents
* Prepaid expenses
* Inventory
* Marketable securities
* Accounts receivable

**Noncurrent assets** include long-term investments that aren’t expected to be converted into cash in the short term, such as:

* Land
* Patents
* Trademarks
* Brands
* Goodwill
* Intellectual property
* Equipment used to produce goods or perform services

A **liability** is the opposite of an asset, it's something a company ***owes***.

**Current liabilities** refer to any liability due to the debtor within one year, which may include:

* Payroll expenses
* Rent payments
* Utility payments
* Debt financing
* Accounts payable
* Other accrued expenses

**Noncurrent liabilities** refer to any long-term obligations or debts which will not be due within one year, which might include:

* Leases
* Loans
* Bonds payable
* Provisions for pensions
* Deferred tax liabilities

Liabilities may also include an obligation to provide goods or services in the future.

# Shareholders Equity

**Shareholders' equity** refers to anything that belongs to the owners of a business after any liabilities are accounted for.

* Common stock
* Preferred stock
* Treasury stock
* Retained earnings

If  you were to add up all of the resources a business owns (the  assets)  and subtract all of the claims from third parties (the  liabilities),  the residual leftover is the owners’ equity.

# Dueling Views:

**Record of capital invested:**  There are some who believe that the main function of a balance sheet is  to record how much a business has invested in its assets-in-place,  i.e., the assets that allow for its current operations to occur.

**Measure of current value:**  There is a large and perhaps dominant school of thought among  accountants, or at least accounting rule writers, that a balance sheet  should reflect the value of the business today.

**Liquidation value:**  There is a third school, with lenders to the firm among its primary  members, who feel that a balance should reflect what you would get for  the assets of the firm, if you liquidated them today.

# Fixed and Current Assets

**The Old Way:** Two or three decades ago, the way you were taught to value fixed and current assets was to show them at **original cost, net of accounting depreciation.**

**The New Way:** As accounting has increasingly adopted the **fair value standard**, there has been a move to mark assets to current market value.

**Divergent Effects:** The difference in values that you get for assets, using the two approaches, varies. It is:

* **Greater on older assets than on newer ones**
* **Greater on fixed assets than current assets**

# Financial Assets

* Financial assets can be holdings of securities or part ownership of other companies, private or public.
* With  holdings of publicly traded securities, the movement to using current  market prices to mark up their values is almost complete.
* With equity ownership in other companies, the rules can vary depending on:  

   * Whether  the stake is viewed as a majority stake (>50%) or a minority stake.  The former will lead to full consolidation (where 100% of the  subsidiaries revenues and operating income will be included in the  parent company’s financials, with the portion that is not owned shown as  minority or non-controlling interest on the liability side) and with  the latter, the actual stake will be shown as an asset.
   * With  a minority stake, whether it is held for trading or as a long-term  investment. With the former, the holding will be marked to market. With  the latter, it will be shown at book value terms.

# Intangible Assets

**Big game:**  Accountants talk a big game when it comes to intangible assets, and  from that talk, you would think that they have figured out how to value  the big intangibles (brand name, management quality etc.).

**But different reality:**  In reality, accountants are much better at valuing small-bore  intangibles like licenses and customer lists, where the earnings and  cash flows from the intangible are observable and forecastable than they  are at valuing the big intangibles.

# Goodwill

* After  all the talk of intangibles in accounting, it is telling that the bulk  of intangible assets on accounting balance sheets across the world take  the form of one item: **goodwill.**
* Goodwill is a plug variable that signifies little.  

   * For goodwill to manifest itself on a balance sheet, a company has to do an **acquisition**.
   * When that **acquisition occurs**, goodwill is measured as the **difference between the price paid on the acquisition and the target company’s asset value (dressed up book value).**
   * It shows up as an asset because **without it in place, balance sheets would not balance.**

# Goodwill Impairment:

**Old rules:**  For much of the last century, goodwill once created in an acquisition,  was written off on autopilot, often amortized over long periods in equal  installments.

**New Rules:** In the late 1990s, both **GAAP** and **IFRS**  rewrote the rules, requiring accountants to revisit goodwill estimates  each year, and make judgments on whether the goodwill had been impaired  or not. To make that judgment, accountants would have to revisit the  target company valuations and decide whether the value had increased (in  which case goodwill would be left unchanged) or decreased (and goodwill  would be impaired).

**Is it informational?**  The rationale for this rule change was to provide information to  markets, but since goodwill impairments are often based upon market  pricing movements (in the sector) and lag them by months and sometimes  years, the effect of goodwill impairments on stock prices has been  negligible.

# Current Liabilities

**Current liabilities can be broadly broken into three groups:**

* **Non-interest-bearing** liabilities, such as accounts payable and supplier credit, which represent part of normal operations.
* **Interest-bearing** short-term borrowings such as commercial paper, short term debt and the short term portion (<1 year) of long term debt.
* **Deferred** salaries, taxes and other amounts due in the short term.

When  computing non-cash working capital, we do not include interest-bearing  short term debt in the calculation, moving it instead into the debt  column.

# Debt Due

When companies borrow money, it can take three forms:

1. **Corporate bonds**, represent debt raised from public markets
2. **Bank loans**, debt raised from banks and other lending institutions
3. **Lease debt**,  arising out of lease contracts requiring lease payments in future  years. Until 2019, only leases classified as capital leases qualified,  but since 2019, operating lease commitments are also debt.

The **mark-to-market movement** on the **asset** side of the balance sheet has been muted on the **liability**  side of the balance sheet. Bank debt, for the most part, is recorded as  originally borrowed, and corporate bonds due, are for the most part not  marked to market.

# Debt details

While  balance sheets are the repositories for total debt due, broken down  into current and long term, there is additional information on debt in  the footnotes, for most companies.

**This additional information can be on three fronts:**

1. Individual debt due, with stated interest rates and maturities.
2. Additional features on the debt, including floating/fixed and straight/convertible provisions.
3. A consolidated table of when debt repayments come due, by year.

# Shareholder’s Equity

**Old ways:**  The shareholders’ equity in a business was a reflection of its entire  history, since it started with the equity brought in to start the  business, adds on equity augmentations over time as well as the  cumulation of retained earnings.

**New ways:** The shareholders’ equity in a business reflects the jumbled mess of mark-to-market accounting, with all of its contradictions.",nm4kla,[],0

Hey guys! 
Cards on the table, I know very little about the stock market and how it works. I understand the concept of return on investment, capital gains, high risk vs low risk, etc.

I’m just looking for advice on what I should do with the 5k sitting in “cash investments” for my contributory IRA. It used to be a profit sharing account managed by my old company’s accounting firm, but I quit that job and moved across the country. They originally put 1.2k into Vanguard ETFs, right before the pandemic, which have performed extravagantly well in the past year. I think it’s up something like 45%. 

TLDR; I have 5k waiting to be invested in my IRA already, I just don’t know what to do with it. Are the returns on this ETF unprecedented, or would I be wise to buy up a few more shares expecting it to see more lift? 

I’m not trying to become financially independent right now, I just hate to see cash sitting there losing value every month and am not sure how to amend that.",nm5h8u,[],0
362,2021-05-27,stocks,"I don’t have the guts for highly speculative plays but I’m trying to be more rational about volatility. The two major risks with high volatility I see are the following:

* For individual stocks, option/leverage plays, actively managed funds, or crazy unpredictable stuff (bitcoin, etc), the risk is it jumping to zero or at least a very low bottom it never gets out of.
* For market-wide index ETFs, it increases the negative swings, so in case of a crash a more volatile fund might drop 60%, a less volatile one only 30%. If you, for whatever reason, need that money in times of a downswing and have to sell, you’re losing out.

The latter, IMO, can be outweighed by even higher upward swings if you’re thinking long-term (10+ years). If we're talking 20 years, the NASDAQ 100 beat the S&P 500, even if you entered at the peak of the dot com bubble. It just took 15 years or so.

I have a concrete example. I’m not from the US, so world-market ETFs are more interesting to me and I’ve been looking at the returns of two specific examples:

iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF USD (Acc)

iShares Edge MSCI World Momentum Factor UCITS ETF (Acc)

Both track the MSCI but the latter adds a [momentum factor](https://www.msci.com/eqb/methodology/meth_docs/MSCI_Momentum_Indexes_Methodology_June2017.pdf). That sounds a bit scary to me but the results are [convincing.](https://i.imgur.com/9eJ0lfE.jpg) If I started in 2014, the March 2020 low would still be higher than that of the non-momentum index. [Here’s a chart going all the way back to 2007](https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/904e031c-94e4-4dbc-a314-7c373446dffa) and it doesn’t look bad, either.

I haven’t found charts going further back, so I wonder, for example, what would have happened during the dot com bubble (for reference: The current highest holding in the momentum index is Tesla with a PE ratio of 620). But I don’t see how it would have been drastically different and it would have swung out of dot com shit within 6 months back then.

I’m trying to be careful so: Am I missing something? To me it seems that for *almost* the same risk, I get *much* better returns long term with the momentum factor.",nm5s7u,[],0
411,2021-05-27,stocks,"I just rebalanced my ETF portfolio and waned to ask if it makes more sense to 1) simply contribute the percentage you chose for that position and rebalance every once in a while or 2) contribute the positions that aren't weighted enough.

Examples:

Your portfolio target is 60% S&P 500 and 40% Total market.
The S&P outperformed the market and you now have 65% S&P and 35% To. mkt.

Should you in your next contribution ...

1) add 60% of it to the S&P and 40% to the Tot. Mkt?

or

2) add to the Tot. mkt. till it's at 40% again? / allocate it so it stays as close to 60/40 as possible?

1) has the advantage of that you‘re still contributing to the winning positions that might continue to outperform, but you need to rebalance regularily.
2) has the advantage of sticking to the right risk tolerance for you and not having to rebalance nearly as often but doesn‘t add to winning positions.

My question is, which makes the most sense? This mostly relates to portfolios that are small compared to your regular contribution (definitely for under 5y/o portfolios or if you‘re seeing massive income growth) because eventually you can‘t make a dent in the allocation and just have to rebalance regularily anyways so it makes little diference.",nm63mh,[],0

> Market-based inflation expectations also look calmer than they have done. The Fed’s favored 5-year, 5-year breakeven, which effectively measures expected inflation from 2026 to 2031, spiked to 2.4% earlier this month. Since then, it has fallen back closer to 2.2%, the kind of level that the Fed now says (truthfully) it would be happy to tolerate: \[image\]  
>  
> This isn’t unalloyed good news. If markets don’t expect so much inflation, it implies that they also don’t expect so much growth. But after the stock market rushed in short order to historically extreme valuations, this kind of not-too-hot-not-too cold “Goldilocks” outlook is just what investors needed. It’s also just what the Fed wants to see.
