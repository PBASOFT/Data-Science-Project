1070,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"GME stock's most recent quarterly report didn't inspire much confidence, either. The company reported 5.5% higher fourth-quarter profit of $1.34 a share. That missed forecasts by nearly 6%. Meanwhile, revenue sank 3% during the quarter to $2.1 billion. The top line fell short of estimates by 5%.

And it's not just a case of a tough quarter. The company's EPS growth rate started declining consistently in 2017 and turned into outright losses for fiscal 2021, which ended in January. Meanwhile, GME stock's sales posted an 18% annualized drop in the past three years.

Interestingly, GME stock's consumer electronics retail group is doing well. It's ranked 8th out of 197 groups, says [**IBD's Stock Checkup**](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-gamestop-corp-gme.aspx). But GME stock's quarter was a disappointment.

Note from Spotgamma on SPX: ""We are still watching the ‚Äúvoid‚Äù that has formed below 4175. It would take a break of 4160, but as you can see in the EquityHub view of SPX, gamma changes quite sharply down to 4055. We interpret this sharp gamma change as ‚Äúvolatility fuels‚Äù and therefore anticipate a fast move to 4055 if 4160 breaks.

* Bulls need to break 420.73 for bullish üéØ
* Bears need to break 417.75 for bearish üéØ
* Support at SMMAs

‚Ä¢ The first patient with SPMS was dosed on May 24, 2021 with nasally administered Foralumab. ¬†The treatment regimen will continue for six months to examine long-term safety, tolerability and clinical responses.
‚Ä¢ Previous clinical studies in healthy volunteers and COVID-19 patients showed that the nasally administered Foralumab is well-tolerated with no apparent severe adverse events (SAEs) when dosed for up to 10 consecutive days. Results from these studies showed strong anti-inflammatory effects of the treatment regimen.
¬†
New York/London, 25 May 2021 ‚Äì Tiziana Life Sciences plc (NASDAQ: TLSA, LSE: TILS) (‚ÄúTiziana‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), a biotechnology company focused on innovative therapeutics for inflammatory diseases and cancers, is pleased to announce that the first patient with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) was dosed with nasally administered Foralumab, a fully human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, at the Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital (BWH), Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. Nasal Foralumab 50 mcg (25 mcg/nostril) will be administered in 3-week cycles, with 3 times/week dosing for the first 2 weeks followed by 1 week of rest period. This first-ever clinical study in SPMS patients, under an Individual Patient Expanded Access IND, will continue for six months to evaluate routine safety, tolerability, and neurological behaviors. The study will also examine microglial activation, by positron emission tomography (PET), immunological and neurodegenerative markers to assess clinical responses following the treatment regimen.
Previously, Tiziana completed a Phase 1 trial of a single-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose (MAD) once a day dosing for 5 consecutive days with nasally administered Foralumab in healthy subjects. The treatment was well-tolerated with no drug-related safety issues reported at doses of up to 250 mcg. (https://www.tizianalifesciences.com/news-item?s=2019-09-10-tiziana-reports-phase-1-clinical-data-demonstrating-nasal-treatment-with-foralumab-was-well-tolerated-and-produced-positive-trend-in-biomarkers-of-immunomodulation-and-anti-inflammation-in-healthy-volunteers)
Subsequently, Tiziana reported positive data from the clinical study with nasally administered Foralumab in COVID-19 patients in Brazil. Results from this clinical study demonstrated that nasally administered Foralumab at 100 mcg/day for consecutive 10 days was well-tolerated and there were no apparent severe adverse events. The clinical results demonstrated that the treatment provided significant reduction of lung inflammation together with a reduction in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), biomarkers of inflammation, in the blood samples taken from patients ( https://www.tizianalifesciences.com/news-item?s=2021-02-02-tiziana-reports-positive-data-from-the-clinical-study-of-nasal-administration-with-foralumab-its-proprietary-fully-human-anti-cd3-monoclonal-antibody-in-covid-19-patients-in-brazil)
¬†
Dr. Howard Weiner, Robert Kroc Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School said, ‚ÄúNasally administered anti-CD3 is an exciting,¬†novel approach that has the ability to provide safe treatment for a form of MS that currently has no effective treatment. We are excited to examine this first-in-class approach to treat patients with SPMS for whom no effective treatment option is currently available.‚Äù
Dr. Tanuja Chitnis, Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School and senior neurologist at the BWH, adds, ‚ÄúEffective and targeted treatments for progressive MS are urgently needed. Nasal Foralumab could revolutionize treatment for this disabling form of disease.‚Äù ¬†

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 7 OF REGULATION 2014/596/EU (WHICH FORMS PART OF DOMESTIC UK LAW PURSUANT TO THE EUROPEAN UNION (WITHDRAWAL) ACT 2018) (""UK MAR""). UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION (AS DEFINED IN UK MAR) IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.

About Foralumab
Foralumab (formerly NI-0401), the only entirely human anti-CD3 mAb, shows reduced release of cytokines after IV administration in patients with Crohn's disease with decreases in the classic side effects of cytokine release syndrome and improves the overall safety profile of Foralumab. In a humanized mouse model (NOD/SCID IL2Œ≥c-/-), it was shown that whilst targeting the T cell receptor, orally administered Foralumab modulates immune responses of the T cells, enhances regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and thus provides therapeutic benefit in treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases without the occurrence of potential adverse events usually associated with parenteral mAb therapy (Ogura M. et al., 2017). Based on animal studies, the nasal and oral administration of Foralumab offers the potential for the immunotherapy of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in a safe manner by the induction of Tregs.
About Tiziana Life SciencesTiziana Life Sciences plc is a dual listed (NASDAQ: TLSA, UK LSE: TILS) biotechnology company that focuses on the discovery and development of novel molecules to treat human diseases in oncology, inflammation and infectious diseases. In addition to Milciclib, the Company will be shortly initiating Phase 2 studies with orally administered Foralumab for Crohn‚Äôs Disease and nasally administered Foralumab for progressive multiple sclerosis. Foralumab is the only fully human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (‚ÄúmAb‚Äù) in clinical development in the world. This Phase 2 compound has potential application in a wide range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn‚Äôs Disease, multiple sclerosis, type-1 diabetes (‚ÄúT1D‚Äù), inflammatory bowel disease (‚ÄúIBD‚Äù), psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, where modulation of a T-cell response is desirable. The Company is accelerating development of anti-Interleukin 6 receptor (‚ÄúIL6R‚Äù) mAb, a fully human monoclonal antibody for treatment of IL6-induced inflammation, especially for treatment of COVID-19 patients.

lately with all the news from Disney+ and HBO max.
Looking for a pure play in the streaming service
came across Curiosity Stream. Basically the platform
offers documentaries about science, history, politics,
etc... and they have over 3000+ titles in the platform.
The founder is John Hendricks, founder and former
chairman of Discovery.

After digging a little bit I was surprised to see that
despite having 13M subscribers total revenue for Q3
was only $8.9M, giving an ARPU of only $0.15 which
seems ridiculous for the amount of value you are
getting. It seems like a good amount of the subscriber
base comes from bundled packages at a heavy
discount. They are looking for exposure while growing
at all costs. Here are some key point:
‚Ä¢ The company has no debt and $180M cash in the
balance sheet.
‚Ä¢ The company went from 2M bundled subscriptions in
Q1 2019 to 13M in Q3 2020
¬∑ Over 60% gross margin
‚Ä¢ They project 10x growth by 2025 with $400M in
revenues

Giving the uncertainty of the current market
environment it seems pretty safe to buy something
that sells $1 a month subscriptions and is disrupting
an industry, targeting a more sophisticated customers
instead of the average becky who likes stranger things.
The last time John Hendricks created something
(Discovery) he turned a $5M investment into a
$32B company before stepping down and creating
CuriosityStream.
I believe we could see a jump to 19 dollars by the end of september.

Side note: John Hendricks has been buying shares this
month increasing his position by 21%.

1097,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"This could be very bad for bag holders who bought at say $7.00.  Now, you need to pick up $30 for even, not $3.00.  The S&P would need to tumble dramatically to reach that market price.

That being said, the reverse also diminished the amount of shares available from 8.3 billion to 838 million.  I can see a rush on remaining shares is probable even if the S&P rises. 

June will be the tell all month for the indices.  So much is over valued, inflation has shown itself, home prices are rising and so are interest rates, raw products and manufacturing production are on just in time mode.  None of industries or suppliers want to be burden with inventory setting when demand slows or even halts. 

Keeping the inventories low will command higher prices for goods thereby creating a vacuum for import products.  Then the domestic manufacturers and suppliers will once again be competing with low priced imports.  This is good and bad.

The good is employers will be relieved from trying to hiring just some skin with a pulse.  It will also be good for manufacturers who still have production overseas.

The bad is unemployment, or at the very least harder to find a job because these jobs will be reserved for the real producers.  A rikity diploma from some liberal college will have no leverage and mean nothing again.  A high school graduation diploma from California or the likes will be a joke, even in that state.  Inflation and interest rates will rise.  Home sales, as we found the truth out today, will fall.  

Happened in the 70's, interest rates hit 20%+.  It was more lucrative to deposit money in the banks, which this money normally used for investing.  The saving rates were higher than their return on risk of building, risk of investment in stocks, risk of expansion.

Happened again in the start of the 80's, interest rate tipping 18.75%+.  Unemployment rise again.  Foreclosures daily.

In the 90's, interest rates for mortgage were at about 10%+.  Then later in the 90's, it subsided to around 7%.

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG‚Äôs Graphene and UQ‚Äôs patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

So this means shorts who bought positions 5/24/2021 need to buy all their shares under or equal to $24.63 or they'll actually add a ""net positive value"" to our stock.

Keep in mind shorts don't work all together, which is fuels short squeezes. Statistically speaking, shorts will likely not be able to hold the price low enough long enough in order for them to buy 40.5 million shares below $24.62.

My previous post displayed the value shorts need to cover at  or below as $24.63, this value will keep dropping as time goes by. Additionally the new short positions are down ""NET \~$100 million assuming stock price $27"".

""The house always wins, trust the math"" - In this case, we are the house, and statistics are on our side.

**More information:**

We have a strong resistance to break around $26.43 ¬± 1.2, afterwards shorts are screwed as day traders will jump on the bandwagon and pump the shorts out until the next strong resistance of $33.41.

Overcoming a resistance is hard without a catalyst... well we have many coming, and we also have shorts who will be forced to cover. It makes it much easier to break the resistances, and turns them into supports.

Sup, WSB folks!

It‚Äôs Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I‚Äôm the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we‚Äôll take a look at the superior stonk‚Äòs current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‚Äòs fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF‚Äôs GF‚Äôs ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to üêª in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day!

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

1239,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

1241,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run.

1362,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"Hi wallstreetbets, I would love to have the privilege of holding a discussion about Oatly and the plant based market as a consumer with 10 years of experience in this market. Some people here have experience as baristas, store clerks, or restaurant owners that may have their own insights. So hopefully the quality of this post meets your standards as a way to engage in larger conversation about this exciting investment. 

**Some CONTENT before discussion my thoughts on the subject:**

\- 2017 resulted in 650 coffee shop locations, growing to 8500 retail and 10,000 coffee locations at the start of 2021

\- The Starbucks CEO has taken stake and pushed the product in it's stores.

\- It faces competition from brands like Planet Oat which is sold at locations like Dunkin Donuts.¬†

\- Investors include Jay-Z, who has recently been seated on the board of Square in 2021

\- The S-1 mentions competition in cashew and hemp meaning potential possibilities to expand into other cream based or protein powder style markets similar to Cola's expansion into variant beverages. It currently exists in yogurt and some cream markets already (more on this later)

\- Revenues have grown over 100% in the past year.

\- The company faces several lawsuits in Europe around branding with the name ""milk"", which marks the company as a legitimate disruptor in the industry. You may see the Oatly sold as ""Wow no cow!"" in some locations as a countertroll to the effort, meaning that the leadership is pretty ballsy.

\- The company posts losses mostly as a function of growth and aggressive marketting spend.

\- Women **strongly** drive this market, which is inline with other market trends related to women's education and household spending growth.

\- The industry growth in general is very strong and is on a path to upend most plant-based drinks that have had first mover advantage. This is an interesting counterpoint to the idea that the product will be commoditized when it can be a multiple-winner situation for organizations like Trader Joes, restaurants, Walmart, and Costco.

[Some additional CONTENT, for this discussion.](https://preview.redd.it/31xgrjieti171.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=0726ab6cbf236f0325c28f975193854062ef3d46)

**My Thoughts**

Anyway I've noticed none of you apes are talking about Oatly here which is crazy to say the least since this is a god tier $BECKY play. But then again you invest in Beyond and TTCF which are basically low tier products in the plant based world that are pushed by suits who have no idea wtf good quality plant-based foods are and would rather depend on first moving gimmicks. At least that's my opinion after being on a plant based diet for a decade.

Oatly is some good shit, top quality stuff. Beyond and Impossible still have a way to go to MEAT high quality standards, but tbh Oatly is definitely there with respect to substituting the deliciousness of milk and dairy based foods/desert. This is also interesting in the inclusivity sense as many consumers of the world are lactose intolerant. Many restaurants benefit from serving the best quality oat milk over a generic brand in the same vein that restaurants benefit from selling Pepsi and Coca Cola products.

What I'll be paying attention with Oatly GROUP while I read the S-1 will be how they view the general plant based market. If I see that leadership is looking ahead at markets like Cashew based creams or fermented cashew cheeses then it's all systems go for me. I mean these freaks already put oil in their milk so I wouldn't be surprised to see it. In some ways Oatly kind of reminds me of Coca Cola's ability to expand in beverage markets.

Trust me in the past 10 years, the vegan cheese and cooking game has definitely evolved and it is not terribly reliant on low tier substitutes like Daiya anymore.

Alright that's my useless rambling on the subject. Hopefully it engages you and we can discuss more about it.

2731,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"The streaming industry is getting a lot of exposure
lately with all the news from Disney+ and HBO max.
Looking for a pure play in the streaming service
came across Curiosity Stream. Basically the platform
offers documentaries about science, history, politics,
etc... and they have over 3000+ titles in the platform.
The founder is John Hendricks, founder and former
chairman of Discovery.

After digging a little bit I was surprised to see that
despite having 13M subscribers total revenue for Q3
was only $8.9M, giving an ARPU of only $0.15 which
seems ridiculous for the amount of value you are
getting. It seems like a good amount of the subscriber
base comes from bundled packages at a heavy
discount. They are looking for exposure while growing
at all costs. Here are some key point:
‚Ä¢ The company has no debt and $180M cash in the
balance sheet.
‚Ä¢ The company went from 2M bundled subscriptions in
Q1 2019 to 13M in Q3 2020
¬∑ Over 60% gross margin
‚Ä¢ They project 10x growth by 2025 with $400M in
revenues

Giving the uncertainty of the current market
environment it seems pretty safe to buy something
that sells $1 a month subscriptions and is disrupting
an industry, targeting a more sophisticated customers
instead of the average becky who likes stranger things.
The last time John Hendricks created something
(Discovery) he turned a $5M investment into a
$32B company before stepping down and creating
CuriosityStream.
I believe we could see a jump to 19 dollars by the end of september.

Side note: John Hendricks has been buying shares this

That being said, the reverse also diminished the amount of shares available from 8.3 billion to 838 million.  I can see a rush on remaining shares is probable even if the S&P rises. 

June will be the tell all month for the indices.  So much is over valued, inflation has shown itself, home prices are rising and so are interest rates, raw products and manufacturing production are on just in time mode.  None of industries or suppliers want to be burden with inventory setting when demand slows or even halts. 

Keeping the inventories low will command higher prices for goods thereby creating a vacuum for import products.  Then the domestic manufacturers and suppliers will once again be competing with low priced imports.  This is good and bad.

The good is employers will be relieved from trying to hiring just some skin with a pulse.  It will also be good for manufacturers who still have production overseas.

The bad is unemployment, or at the very least harder to find a job because these jobs will be reserved for the real producers.  A rikity diploma from some liberal college will have no leverage and mean nothing again.  A high school graduation diploma from California or the likes will be a joke, even in that state.  Inflation and interest rates will rise.  Home sales, as we found the truth out today, will fall.  

Happened in the 70's, interest rates hit 20%+.  It was more lucrative to deposit money in the banks, which this money normally used for investing.  The saving rates were higher than their return on risk of building, risk of investment in stocks, risk of expansion.

Happened again in the start of the 80's, interest rate tipping 18.75%+.  Unemployment rise again.  Foreclosures daily.

In the 90's, interest rates for mortgage were at about 10%+.  Then later in the 90's, it subsided to around 7%.

The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

Sup, WSB folks!

It‚Äôs Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I‚Äôm the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we‚Äôll take a look at the superior stonk‚Äòs current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‚Äòs fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF‚Äôs GF‚Äôs ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to üêª in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day!

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

2771,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability.

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

2791,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"I must start this with do not touch your AMC for anything let alone a stock that hasnt even cemented itself in this new world - but the memeconemy is having a revival and with Wall St's apparent dislike of this company through shorts I think UWMC may have a nice place in this new order.

EDIT: short TLDR said beutifully by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can‚Äôt fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It‚Äôs a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \(high short float\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",nlpfk9,"['GME', 'AMC']",0

2800,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"Hi wallstreetbets, I would love to have the privilege of holding a discussion about Oatly and the plant based market as a consumer with 10 years of experience in this market. Some people here have experience as baristas, store clerks, or restaurant owners that may have their own insights. So hopefully the quality of this post meets your standards as a way to engage in larger conversation about this exciting investment. 

**Some CONTENT before discussion my thoughts on the subject:**

\- 2017 resulted in 650 coffee shop locations, growing to 8500 retail and 10,000 coffee locations at the start of 2021

\- The Starbucks CEO has taken stake and pushed the product in it's stores.

\- It faces competition from brands like Planet Oat which is sold at locations like Dunkin Donuts.¬†

\- Investors include Jay-Z, who has recently been seated on the board of Square in 2021

\- The S-1 mentions competition in cashew and hemp meaning potential possibilities to expand into other cream based or protein powder style markets similar to Cola's expansion into variant beverages. It currently exists in yogurt and some cream markets already (more on this later)

\- Revenues have grown over 100% in the past year.

\- The company faces several lawsuits in Europe around branding with the name ""milk"", which marks the company as a legitimate disruptor in the industry. You may see the Oatly sold as ""Wow no cow!"" in some locations as a countertroll to the effort, meaning that the leadership is pretty ballsy.

\- The company posts losses mostly as a function of growth and aggressive marketting spend.

\- Women **strongly** drive this market, which is inline with other market trends related to women's education and household spending growth.

\- The industry growth in general is very strong and is on a path to upend most plant-based drinks that have had first mover advantage. This is an interesting counterpoint to the idea that the product will be commoditized when it can be a multiple-winner situation for organizations like Trader Joes, restaurants, Walmart, and Costco.

[Some additional CONTENT, for this discussion.](https://preview.redd.it/31xgrjieti171.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=0726ab6cbf236f0325c28f975193854062ef3d46)

**My Thoughts**

Anyway I've noticed none of you apes are talking about Oatly here which is crazy to say the least since this is a god tier $BECKY play. But then again you invest in Beyond and TTCF which are basically low tier products in the plant based world that are pushed by suits who have no idea wtf good quality plant-based foods are and would rather depend on first moving gimmicks. At least that's my opinion after being on a plant based diet for a decade.

Oatly is some good shit, top quality stuff. Beyond and Impossible still have a way to go to MEAT high quality standards, but tbh Oatly is definitely there with respect to substituting the deliciousness of milk and dairy based foods/desert. This is also interesting in the inclusivity sense as many consumers of the world are lactose intolerant. Many restaurants benefit from serving the best quality oat milk over a generic brand in the same vein that restaurants benefit from selling Pepsi and Coca Cola products.

What I'll be paying attention with Oatly GROUP while I read the S-1 will be how they view the general plant based market. If I see that leadership is looking ahead at markets like Cashew based creams or fermented cashew cheeses then it's all systems go for me. I mean these freaks already put oil in their milk so I wouldn't be surprised to see it. In some ways Oatly kind of reminds me of Coca Cola's ability to expand in beverage markets.

Trust me in the past 10 years, the vegan cheese and cooking game has definitely evolved and it is not terribly reliant on low tier substitutes like Daiya anymore.

Alright that's my useless rambling on the subject. Hopefully it engages you and we can discuss more about it.

2806,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"First off. Forget that Blackberry is a phone company. Blackberry is a growth late stage start up that utilizes the logistics and patents of an old phone company

Black berry‚Äôs forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let‚Äôs start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It‚Äôs essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars‚Äô software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla‚Äôs self driving cars, they‚Äôll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It‚Äôs confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It‚Äôs cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That‚Äôs $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

lately with all the news from Disney+ and HBO max.
Looking for a pure play in the streaming service
came across Curiosity Stream. Basically the platform
offers documentaries about science, history, politics,
etc... and they have over 3000+ titles in the platform.
The founder is John Hendricks, founder and former
chairman of Discovery.

After digging a little bit I was surprised to see that
despite having 13M subscribers total revenue for Q3
was only $8.9M, giving an ARPU of only $0.15 which
seems ridiculous for the amount of value you are
getting. It seems like a good amount of the subscriber
base comes from bundled packages at a heavy
discount. They are looking for exposure while growing
at all costs. Here are some key point:
‚Ä¢ The company has no debt and $180M cash in the
balance sheet.
‚Ä¢ The company went from 2M bundled subscriptions in
Q1 2019 to 13M in Q3 2020
¬∑ Over 60% gross margin
‚Ä¢ They project 10x growth by 2025 with $400M in
revenues

Giving the uncertainty of the current market
environment it seems pretty safe to buy something
that sells $1 a month subscriptions and is disrupting
an industry, targeting a more sophisticated customers
instead of the average becky who likes stranger things.
The last time John Hendricks created something
(Discovery) he turned a $5M investment into a
$32B company before stepping down and creating
CuriosityStream.

That being said, the reverse also diminished the amount of shares available from 8.3 billion to 838 million.  I can see a rush on remaining shares is probable even if the S&P rises. 

June will be the tell all month for the indices.  So much is over valued, inflation has shown itself, home prices are rising and so are interest rates, raw products and manufacturing production are on just in time mode.  None of industries or suppliers want to be burden with inventory setting when demand slows or even halts. 

Keeping the inventories low will command higher prices for goods thereby creating a vacuum for import products.  Then the domestic manufacturers and suppliers will once again be competing with low priced imports.  This is good and bad.

The good is employers will be relieved from trying to hiring just some skin with a pulse.  It will also be good for manufacturers who still have production overseas.

The bad is unemployment, or at the very least harder to find a job because these jobs will be reserved for the real producers.  A rikity diploma from some liberal college will have no leverage and mean nothing again.  A high school graduation diploma from California or the likes will be a joke, even in that state.  Inflation and interest rates will rise.  Home sales, as we found the truth out today, will fall.  

Happened in the 70's, interest rates hit 20%+.  It was more lucrative to deposit money in the banks, which this money normally used for investing.  The saving rates were higher than their return on risk of building, risk of investment in stocks, risk of expansion.

Happened again in the start of the 80's, interest rate tipping 18.75%+.  Unemployment rise again.  Foreclosures daily.

Sup, WSB folks!

It‚Äôs Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I‚Äôm the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we‚Äôll take a look at the superior stonk‚Äòs current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‚Äòs fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF‚Äôs GF‚Äôs ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to üêª in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day!

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices. I know many people who want to travel but few who want to buy stock.**",nlmxyt,[],1

3320,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

3322,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run.

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

3349,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"Hi wallstreetbets, I would love to have the privilege of holding a discussion about Oatly and the plant based market as a consumer with 10 years of experience in this market. Some people here have experience as baristas, store clerks, or restaurant owners that may have their own insights. So hopefully the quality of this post meets your standards as a way to engage in larger conversation about this exciting investment. 

**Some CONTENT before discussion my thoughts on the subject:**

\- 2017 resulted in 650 coffee shop locations, growing to 8500 retail and 10,000 coffee locations at the start of 2021

\- The Starbucks CEO has taken stake and pushed the product in it's stores.

\- It faces competition from brands like Planet Oat which is sold at locations like Dunkin Donuts.¬†

\- Investors include Jay-Z, who has recently been seated on the board of Square in 2021

\- The S-1 mentions competition in cashew and hemp meaning potential possibilities to expand into other cream based or protein powder style markets similar to Cola's expansion into variant beverages. It currently exists in yogurt and some cream markets already (more on this later)

\- Revenues have grown over 100% in the past year.

\- The company faces several lawsuits in Europe around branding with the name ""milk"", which marks the company as a legitimate disruptor in the industry. You may see the Oatly sold as ""Wow no cow!"" in some locations as a countertroll to the effort, meaning that the leadership is pretty ballsy.

\- The company posts losses mostly as a function of growth and aggressive marketting spend.

\- Women **strongly** drive this market, which is inline with other market trends related to women's education and household spending growth.

\- The industry growth in general is very strong and is on a path to upend most plant-based drinks that have had first mover advantage. This is an interesting counterpoint to the idea that the product will be commoditized when it can be a multiple-winner situation for organizations like Trader Joes, restaurants, Walmart, and Costco.

[Some additional CONTENT, for this discussion.](https://preview.redd.it/31xgrjieti171.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=0726ab6cbf236f0325c28f975193854062ef3d46)

**My Thoughts**

Anyway I've noticed none of you apes are talking about Oatly here which is crazy to say the least since this is a god tier $BECKY play. But then again you invest in Beyond and TTCF which are basically low tier products in the plant based world that are pushed by suits who have no idea wtf good quality plant-based foods are and would rather depend on first moving gimmicks. At least that's my opinion after being on a plant based diet for a decade.

Oatly is some good shit, top quality stuff. Beyond and Impossible still have a way to go to MEAT high quality standards, but tbh Oatly is definitely there with respect to substituting the deliciousness of milk and dairy based foods/desert. This is also interesting in the inclusivity sense as many consumers of the world are lactose intolerant. Many restaurants benefit from serving the best quality oat milk over a generic brand in the same vein that restaurants benefit from selling Pepsi and Coca Cola products.

What I'll be paying attention with Oatly GROUP while I read the S-1 will be how they view the general plant based market. If I see that leadership is looking ahead at markets like Cashew based creams or fermented cashew cheeses then it's all systems go for me. I mean these freaks already put oil in their milk so I wouldn't be surprised to see it. In some ways Oatly kind of reminds me of Coca Cola's ability to expand in beverage markets.

Trust me in the past 10 years, the vegan cheese and cooking game has definitely evolved and it is not terribly reliant on low tier substitutes like Daiya anymore.

Black berry‚Äôs forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let‚Äôs start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It‚Äôs essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars‚Äô software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla‚Äôs self driving cars, they‚Äôll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It‚Äôs confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It‚Äôs cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That‚Äôs $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

Sup, WSB folks!

It‚Äôs Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I‚Äôm the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we‚Äôll take a look at the superior stonk‚Äòs current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‚Äòs fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF‚Äôs GF‚Äôs ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to üêª in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day!

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

5373,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

5375,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

The company is the largest independent transporter of refiner products \~6800 miles of refined product pipelines and \~3100 miles of crude pipelines.

Kinder Morgan is also the largest independent terminal operator with 144 terminals & 16 Jones Act vessels. These together enabled the company to increase natural gas income during the Texas storm, something that wasn't a one-off. The company is the largest CO2 transporter with \~1.5 bcf/day of capacity, showing its strength.

* Kinder Morgan benefited off of the Texas Storm with its DCF expected to reach almost $6 billion for the year.
* The company has a dividend of almost 6% and it's continuing to invest in its business for the long run.
* The company has an impressive and diverse portfolio of assets which we expect it'll be able to utilize to drive substantial long-term shareholder rewards.

5393,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"I must start this with do not touch your AMC for anything let alone a stock that hasnt even cemented itself in this new world - but the memeconemy is having a revival and with Wall St's apparent dislike of this company through shorts I think UWMC may have a nice place in this new order.

EDIT: short TLDR said beutifully by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can‚Äôt fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It‚Äôs a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \(high short float\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",nlpfk9,"['GME', 'AMC']",0

5402,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"Hi wallstreetbets, I would love to have the privilege of holding a discussion about Oatly and the plant based market as a consumer with 10 years of experience in this market. Some people here have experience as baristas, store clerks, or restaurant owners that may have their own insights. So hopefully the quality of this post meets your standards as a way to engage in larger conversation about this exciting investment. 

**Some CONTENT before discussion my thoughts on the subject:**

\- 2017 resulted in 650 coffee shop locations, growing to 8500 retail and 10,000 coffee locations at the start of 2021

\- The Starbucks CEO has taken stake and pushed the product in it's stores.

\- It faces competition from brands like Planet Oat which is sold at locations like Dunkin Donuts.¬†

\- Investors include Jay-Z, who has recently been seated on the board of Square in 2021

\- The S-1 mentions competition in cashew and hemp meaning potential possibilities to expand into other cream based or protein powder style markets similar to Cola's expansion into variant beverages. It currently exists in yogurt and some cream markets already (more on this later)

\- Revenues have grown over 100% in the past year.

\- The company faces several lawsuits in Europe around branding with the name ""milk"", which marks the company as a legitimate disruptor in the industry. You may see the Oatly sold as ""Wow no cow!"" in some locations as a countertroll to the effort, meaning that the leadership is pretty ballsy.

\- The company posts losses mostly as a function of growth and aggressive marketting spend.

\- Women **strongly** drive this market, which is inline with other market trends related to women's education and household spending growth.

\- The industry growth in general is very strong and is on a path to upend most plant-based drinks that have had first mover advantage. This is an interesting counterpoint to the idea that the product will be commoditized when it can be a multiple-winner situation for organizations like Trader Joes, restaurants, Walmart, and Costco.

[Some additional CONTENT, for this discussion.](https://preview.redd.it/31xgrjieti171.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=0726ab6cbf236f0325c28f975193854062ef3d46)

**My Thoughts**

Anyway I've noticed none of you apes are talking about Oatly here which is crazy to say the least since this is a god tier $BECKY play. But then again you invest in Beyond and TTCF which are basically low tier products in the plant based world that are pushed by suits who have no idea wtf good quality plant-based foods are and would rather depend on first moving gimmicks. At least that's my opinion after being on a plant based diet for a decade.

Oatly is some good shit, top quality stuff. Beyond and Impossible still have a way to go to MEAT high quality standards, but tbh Oatly is definitely there with respect to substituting the deliciousness of milk and dairy based foods/desert. This is also interesting in the inclusivity sense as many consumers of the world are lactose intolerant. Many restaurants benefit from serving the best quality oat milk over a generic brand in the same vein that restaurants benefit from selling Pepsi and Coca Cola products.

What I'll be paying attention with Oatly GROUP while I read the S-1 will be how they view the general plant based market. If I see that leadership is looking ahead at markets like Cashew based creams or fermented cashew cheeses then it's all systems go for me. I mean these freaks already put oil in their milk so I wouldn't be surprised to see it. In some ways Oatly kind of reminds me of Coca Cola's ability to expand in beverage markets.

Trust me in the past 10 years, the vegan cheese and cooking game has definitely evolved and it is not terribly reliant on low tier substitutes like Daiya anymore.

Alright that's my useless rambling on the subject. Hopefully it engages you and we can discuss more about it.

Knowing nothing, I‚Äôve now made $3.84 and also cost the assholes an absurd amount of money. It feels good, man.

5407,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"First off. Forget that Blackberry is a phone company. Blackberry is a growth late stage start up that utilizes the logistics and patents of an old phone company

Black berry‚Äôs forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let‚Äôs start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It‚Äôs essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars‚Äô software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla‚Äôs self driving cars, they‚Äôll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It‚Äôs confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It‚Äôs cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That‚Äôs $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG‚Äôs Graphene and UQ‚Äôs patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

Sup, WSB folks!

It‚Äôs Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I‚Äôm the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we‚Äôll take a look at the superior stonk‚Äòs current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‚Äòs fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF‚Äôs GF‚Äôs ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to üêª in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day!

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices. I know many people who want to travel but few who want to buy stock.**",nlmxyt,[],1

5901,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

5903,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run.

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

5930,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"Hi wallstreetbets, I would love to have the privilege of holding a discussion about Oatly and the plant based market as a consumer with 10 years of experience in this market. Some people here have experience as baristas, store clerks, or restaurant owners that may have their own insights. So hopefully the quality of this post meets your standards as a way to engage in larger conversation about this exciting investment. 

**Some CONTENT before discussion my thoughts on the subject:**

\- 2017 resulted in 650 coffee shop locations, growing to 8500 retail and 10,000 coffee locations at the start of 2021

\- The Starbucks CEO has taken stake and pushed the product in it's stores.

\- It faces competition from brands like Planet Oat which is sold at locations like Dunkin Donuts.¬†

\- Investors include Jay-Z, who has recently been seated on the board of Square in 2021

\- The S-1 mentions competition in cashew and hemp meaning potential possibilities to expand into other cream based or protein powder style markets similar to Cola's expansion into variant beverages. It currently exists in yogurt and some cream markets already (more on this later)

\- Revenues have grown over 100% in the past year.

\- The company faces several lawsuits in Europe around branding with the name ""milk"", which marks the company as a legitimate disruptor in the industry. You may see the Oatly sold as ""Wow no cow!"" in some locations as a countertroll to the effort, meaning that the leadership is pretty ballsy.

\- The company posts losses mostly as a function of growth and aggressive marketting spend.

\- Women **strongly** drive this market, which is inline with other market trends related to women's education and household spending growth.

\- The industry growth in general is very strong and is on a path to upend most plant-based drinks that have had first mover advantage. This is an interesting counterpoint to the idea that the product will be commoditized when it can be a multiple-winner situation for organizations like Trader Joes, restaurants, Walmart, and Costco.

But then again you invest in Beyond and TTCF which are basically low tier products in the plant based world that are pushed by suits who have no idea wtf good quality plant-based foods are and would rather depend on first moving gimmicks. At least that's my opinion after being on a plant based diet for a decade.

Oatly is some good shit, top quality stuff. Beyond and Impossible still have a way to go to MEAT high quality standards, but tbh Oatly is definitely there with respect to substituting the deliciousness of milk and dairy based foods/desert. This is also interesting in the inclusivity sense as many consumers of the world are lactose intolerant. Many restaurants benefit from serving the best quality oat milk over a generic brand in the same vein that restaurants benefit from selling Pepsi and Coca Cola products.

What I'll be paying attention with Oatly GROUP while I read the S-1 will be how they view the general plant based market. If I see that leadership is looking ahead at markets like Cashew based creams or fermented cashew cheeses then it's all systems go for me. I mean these freaks already put oil in their milk so I wouldn't be surprised to see it. In some ways Oatly kind of reminds me of Coca Cola's ability to expand in beverage markets.

Trust me in the past 10 years, the vegan cheese and cooking game has definitely evolved and it is not terribly reliant on low tier substitutes like Daiya anymore.

Alright that's my useless rambling on the subject. Hopefully it engages you and we can discuss more about it. 

TL;DR I'm unsure if I can post a TL;DR on take 3, because that would mean that it belongs in the daily discussion thread.",nlq624,[],1

After all this short selling business started I was bored and felt like sticking it to the 1%, so I bought a single AMC share at $16. It‚Äôs all I had at the time as I was laid off due to COVID.

Knowing nothing, I‚Äôve now made $3.84 and also cost the assholes an absurd amount of money. It feels good, man.

I just want to celebrate with anyone else who went in to this thing blind‚Äî we doing something! I‚Äôm not quite sure how, but we are doing it. Fuck yeah!",nlqjeu,['AMC'],0
5935,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"First off. Forget that Blackberry is a phone company. Blackberry is a growth late stage start up that utilizes the logistics and patents of an old phone company

Black berry‚Äôs forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let‚Äôs start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It‚Äôs essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars‚Äô software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla‚Äôs self driving cars, they‚Äôll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It‚Äôs confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It‚Äôs cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That‚Äôs $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

This stock is a deep fucking value",nlqklx,['AI'],0

1.29 Billion. The company has 0 debt and 750 million cash on hand. With assets, employees, and systems i believe it is massively undervalued $SNDL imagine how apeshit the hype machine would go if tilray or cgc said they are debt free, had a billion in the bank, formed a banking/investing joint venture and possible spac, AND bought 90 stores soon to be 120 by years end? Then sprinkle in any of their ceos being able to match their sales output with realized capital gains and interest fees from lending.... Enough of this sundial has poor fundamentals shit. We have the beat fundamentals in Canada maybe the world and folks won't know about it til YOU tell them. Dont sell them a squeeze. Sell them the Swiss Army knife that is sundial growers.

I'm bullish af on it, plus they're expanding into Norway which will turn them into an international EV manufacturer.  

With that being said I haven't done any DD into them yet.  

Not financial advice blah blah blah. 

Looking to see what my fellow smooth brains think about the company!",nlscic,[],0
