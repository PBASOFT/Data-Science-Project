You can see what all the insiders have been doing.  Also, sometimes you just need to keep your ear to the ground. Right when Blackberry was starting to meme, they issued a PR saying they didn't know why their stock was going up, and that their CEO (?) had recently sold all of his shares. Never a good sign. My historical favorite has been AEO, and I do whatever the CEO does. His family has been in the industry for a few generations IIRC, and he always seems to know exactly when to buy at the bottom. He often also knows when to sell at the top. So I just follow that stock long-term. Sometimes I go 2-3 years without investing in it, then when it drops, I'll hit it hard. But I keep my eye on news articles every month or 2.  
And watch out for high dividend yields; they look nice now, but that can indicate a problem with the stock. Example: if the share price goes down 50%, the dividend yield goes up 100%. The company is much more likely to cut it to conserve cash. If you like high dividends tho, I found HRZN last year. They are a ""business development company's and regularly pay out 7-10% per year. The stock might be a little pricey now; I last bought at $13 and haven't bought more, since all stocks seem a little high.

Tech stocks and many of the big winners have lost their momentum. Why wouldn’t they?

Pier 1 at the time made the most retail growth. Well , is the world going from staying trapped inside and now it seems they can go out and about again? Yes. So the gains they have had is most likely going to reverse. Also, much of what they sold had huge price increases, like lumber during this period. So the individual items went up and not just the number of items sold. If people think resources will go down in price again after an initial rise of the next 6 or so months, then Lowes looks like something poised to go down.

Hwang makes a swap contract basically saying this underlying asset(stock) will go up. When it does, the banks keep some of the profit in fees and the rest goes to him. The banks buy the stock so that the underlying asset exists, which pumps the stock. This is why Hwang never shows up as a buyer, but banks do. Banks owned as much as 10% of Viacom. 

A downside to not owning the stock himself: the banks pulled the plug when the stock started trading sideways. Then the margin calls come.

""Sell in May and go away."" 

The whole market is indeed down. Stocks rose in May, so a lot of people are selling towards the end of May. 

Institutional investors might be doing some rotation and locking in profits. Couple that with retail investors possibly looking to put money into more speculative stocks, and this is what you get.

When everything is going down, a few anomalies may get propped up. 

To put things into perspective, the SP500 is still over 4000 points. Looking from the ATH, this isn't even a correction yet. 

To begin with, you shouldn't put faith into the market because you will inevitably lose that faith. Markets are what they are. If you own index funds, pullbacks just mean dollar cost averaging. If you own individual stocks that you liked at X price, then, provided you have liquidity, you should absolutely adore that stock at 0.8X. My personal favorite stock has dipped below my previous average price and I've been buying that dip for almost a week now. It just keeps dipping and I'm running out of liquidity, but I honestly don't care because I've read zero news about why it's going down - so this is just an opportunity for me.",[],0

But I think that pharmaceutical companies don't have nearly as much of an incentive to discover new antibiotics or antivirals . . . when they could be developing antidepressants or anti-hypertensive medication which requires the patient to take a pill every day for basically the rest of their life. 

For example, this one pharmaceutical company discovered a revolutionary new antibiotic that was a versatile tool against resistant strains of bacteria like MRSA and VRE . . . and the CDC basically reviewed their data and said ""Wow, this is a great new drug you got there. But you aren't allowed to put it on the market. Because the bacteria are adapting to every antibiotic we got so far, so we need at least one ace up our sleeve. So if a super-resistant bacterial strain goes around trying to kill everyone, we'll have one weapon that they ain't never seen yet""

In the context of trading, imagine everyone is super hyped about the new Tesla model. A bunch of newbie investors buy stock ahead of its release. The release comes, and the reception is lukewarm. Some of these newbie investors get nervous and sell their stock. Other newbie investors see this and panic sell.

Suddenly, the price tanks and smarter investors see the long term potential and snatch up cheap stocks. The newbies see the price climbing again and buy back in hoping to make some money up from their panic selling. One of the newbies gets nervous again and cashes out, causing another dip from panic selling, leading to *more* stocks being bought for cheap.

Maxeon spun off from its parent company, Sunpower. Sunpower had a contract signed more than 10 years ago, where they had to buy polysilicone at a fixed price. Right now, this price from the contract is much higher than the market price, and the contract was transferred to Maxeon. So until the end of 2022, they basically have to pay triple or smth like that the market price of this material.

When adjusting for the losses caused by this contract, MAXN should be profitable. I’m planning to accumulate stock until 2022. When the burden of this out-of-market polysilicone contract phases out, they will probably shoot up.

If that's the case, isn't a casino mentality a better mindset than worrying about what few cents on the dollar X company made this quarter?  It is better to attempt to manipulate asset pricing to garner more share of the ever growing money stock, than it is to worry about earnings in an economy that is shrinking in relation. 

This chart shows no sign of reversing and we have no reason to believe it will.  If you want to see how clueless the Fed is about the situation, read this [article.](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2016/04/a-plodding-dollar-the-recent-decrease-in-the-velocity-of-money/?utm_source=series_page&utm_medium=related_content&utm_term=related_resources&utm_campaign=fredblog)  You don't need to read it all, just look at the date and the last sentence. 

Maybe some don't understand the importance of money stock.  Why does it matter?  Sure, the economy is shrinking relatively, but not nominally.  Why do more dollars, that are clearly not entering into this economy, matter?  They matter because money stock could also be called political power.  Especially in the US where buying politicians is legalized, money represents political capital.  

The economy has no power as it shrinks.  The economy is what the government taxes.  It too will shrink as a result.  The people who have the money are rising in power.  He who controls it, controls all.",[],0

The study tracked emissions upstream. So, when you burn gasoline in your car or natural gas in your house, the oil company that extracted it is considered ""responsible"" for the emissions. Because of this upstream tracing, the entire top 50 (listed on page 14) is coal and oil producers.

What's more, not all entities in the top 100 were corporations. For example, the number 1 spot is held by China's *entire coal industry as a whole*.

People yet don't understand what a cash flow and a EBITDA is, they just buy what they hear from friends or read on Twitter. Institutions play that and pump stocks before earnings, just to dump them once the news is out, whatever it might say.

LifeMD appears to use unlicensed doctors to dispense OTC medications, has implemented an autoshipping/autobilling scheme, failed to honor guarantees, and put in place abusive telemarketing practices.  
So what does the stock do in response to this? Of course, it jumps 12%.

  
I understand your frustration on the general market OP, but perhaps I can defend the LFMD stock because of my personal DD and holding positions in the stock itself since April.  
The lawsuits are based on a short report by Culper Research, with claims that have unfounded evidence against LifeMD. The company have since issued statements to refute the claims, and additionally SUED the institution! 

  
The company itself posted spectacular earnings for Q1 recently, with revenue up 323% YOY, and have increased revenue guidance for AY2021. 

  
With LifeMD's fundamentals getting better, having good catalysts lining up (news of endorsement from celebrities Kate del Castillo and Bellamy Young, receiving grants, information of INSIDER BUYING, and institutional holdings increasing to 34%), and having the current consensus from 2 analyst of a 12-month PT of $37.50, it is IMO a reasonable justification for its performance in the past few days. Granted, I was also surprised by the huge jump in such a short frame of time, but nonetheless it is expected.

  
I do agree that this market seems to be more and more driven by ""memes"" and WSB gambles, but I believe that there are still good companies that will give back to their investors in the long run, regardless of the noise and the hype in the short-term

521,gyst7jo,2021-05-20,t3_ngcedr,stocks,"From first principles:

So first, there was stuff. Gourds, food, cool rocks, mountains, whatever. But there wasn't quite enough stuff for everybody at some point, and also fuck Steve, because Steve's a dick and he can't have any of these cool rocks I found or food from that cool tree I know about.

So, ownership isn't, like, an inherent physical trait of a thing. It's a matter of agreement, and frequently when this agreement can't be established, it's solved with pointy sticks/bioweapons/icbm's or whatever. It's cool; Steve was a dick and nobody misses him, and also he died back in the mists of prehistory and probably wasn't named that, but we don't respect him enough to think about it too hard.

From ownership we get trade, the transfer of ownership, the agreement that ""I used to own this and you now own this and for whatever reason , that changed without either of us stabbing/nuking one another"", probably because Steve wasn't involved, so if anyone says that thing is mine because they were out of town when we agreed, I'll correct em! Because I'm not Steve.

and from trade we get money, an abstraction a bunch of people agreed on, because bartering is fucking tedious. Like steve. But what *is* money? It's..  just another agreement, right? But this one is less about trust in your neighbors about what goes where, and more like a religion. But a religion about people. It's faith that people will still think the thing is cool tomorrow. For a while, some of the first money was just barter goods that everybody always wanted, like salt or something else that keeps well and is necessary for life. But those things Cary from place to place, so if I from my prairie hut try to trade with some desert nomads and they try to pay me in salt, I'm gonna be fucking pissed. So instead it was based on bullshit arbitrary things; lies a bunch of people bought into. Maybe that thing is shiny rocks, or the us government, or crappy math that draws more power than a mid sized nation. Whatever. But part of what makes a thing cool is other people liking it, right? So money is kind of also a popularity contest. And a religion. But it's convenient, so instead of getting rid of it we mostly just argue over which thing is cool instead of if this stuff is cool.

Stocks are... Okay so originally, they came with a percentage of the corporate income and stuff. But at some point that mostly stopped. Some stocks still pay dividends? But mostly not, and those are nothing compared to the potential profits from the natural churn, so most people don't really care. So it's mostly just money, but instead of dead ~~imperialist warlords and slavers~~ presidents, we get our favorite brands in the pieces of paper our numbers represent! Lowes! Nvidia! Enron! And also if you try to buy a pizza with it, it probably won't work.

So. At this point, the stock market is *a few* layers of abstraction outside of literally anything, right? And you've got a thousand kinds of money that can only buy other money. And you're just getting things against-

Regardless of where they are at as companies they are popular, highly talked about momentum stocks. The trick is knowing when to sell. I have no loyalty to a stock and once it gets caught up in the hype and exuberance of the market I'm taking profit.

I bought GME at $10 and sold at an average of $200. I believed it was undervalued at $10 and fair value, given the turn around possibilities, was $40-$60 max. Once it ran past that I started to take profits and set stops.

I bought PLTR on DPO day for $9.50 and sold at $27, it's a long term stock and will have a good run but it ran too hot too fast as got way ahead of it's valuation. I bought in again recently. 

I bought RKT at $20 and sold at $34. It had consolidated at $20 for months but still had a lot of chatter about it. Once they accounted a special dividends it skyrocketed and I was out. 

I bought CRSR at $37 and it's at $32 and NIO at $42 and it's at $33 so not all wins but I'm ok holding these two for a longer period of time as I see them having solid futures.","['GME', 'PLTR']",1

712,gyt3r61,2021-05-20,t3_ngcedr,stocks,"I can explain from the very uneducated and objective mind:

The market is a human creation. Not an autonomous network. It's an idea that was created and cultivated by the richest and most influential people in the world. All concepts and practices that are created or performed at designed to expand, sell and distribute the wealth of the world's richest.

Sometime in the past 40 years the market opened up to small traders, the average joe, and the middle class sunk their hungry teeth into what was being sold as ""part of the American dream"". This market helped expand the wealth of the world's even further.

The idea that small money can be successful in the stock market is entirely dependent on that small money developing an incredibly narcissistic view on finance. After all, the entire system was designed by narcissists and sociopaths.

It's like playing poker at a casino now. The house will always make money, and out of the 100 people being dealt cards, only 5 or 6 will walk away will full pockets. The system isn't objective, fair, regulated, unbiased, or 'on the level'. It's designed to exploit compassion, fair play, and cooperation.

And it's not a conspiracy. It's animal nature. There are so many people who want it this way they collectively work towards it without needing to have a spoken understanding. Greed is a sin for a reason. And no it's not because it's bad for society (altho it is). It's a sin because just like now, the rich tried to convince the poor that trying too hard to be like them is wrong or bad and will lead to self destruction. It's not self destruction. It's the rich trying to crush possible competition. Which again, is just animal nature.

If you are long congrats. However if you are gonna tell me about their amazing tech & innovation fuck off!  UPST is just another overvalued, Ai, SaaS, Payment High-flyer who forgot it’s 2021 but IPO’ed late last year under the shadow of ABNB & DASH however just like the ladder two GOLDMAN is also their Godfather (took all 3 public) and GS takes care of it’s babies.  Compared to it’s more celebrated peers UPST was of to a slow start. IPO’ed at $20 (the low end of the range $20 - $24), hardly drew any buzz and post IPO sat around for a few days kinda lost. 

GOLDMAN TO THE RESCUE: Once Goldman shoved a stupidly high valuation which the market accepted for ABNB & DASH then it focused it’s attention on poor little UPST and started to drive interest for the shares (part of the GS starter kit when you select them to run your IPO which founders & round investors love.  They need to make sure to pump the price hard before lock-up expiration *THIS IS KEY.

RECAP: UPST, went public at $20 in Dec the week after the other two and once public had a $1.8 Billion valuation and already trading at a rich valuation (just earlier in 2020 it has been valued around $800MM).  

TODAY’s VALUATIONS: Fast forward; today UPST is valued over $10 Billion trading at a whopping $135 per share Est PE: 200X PS: 40X PB: 30X (regardless of future potential growth these are disgustingly high valuations) oh JUST OVER 40% OF THE SHARES ARE STILL LOCKED!  

TRADE / LOCKUP EXPIRATION / JULY: Lock you for UPST is scheduled for early July which will increase the float by 40% and this event will trigger pressure on the shares (round investors selling, in creasing the supply) and mixed with a higher interest rate environment and stupid high valuations WILL CUT THE CURRENT PRICE BY AT LEAST 50%. (You know very well every single 2020 high flyer was cut in half this year. UPST is no exception just delayed). 

PROOF:  Goldman was the investment bank for several other similar IPO’s and applied the same formula.  Check to procure movements, IPO, ramp up, expiration lockup followed by substantial decrease of share prices.  SNOW, DASH, ABNB, BIGC, FROG, PLTR.  

BY AUG THE PRICE WILL BE $50-$60 AND I’LL BE UP 200% ON MY SHORTS",['PLTR'],0

Thought experiment: Sure you can pay every worker out there 5$ per hour more - but what will happen? A dollar ""lives"" off of the difference a worker can achieve with it. Higher risk jobs will demand not just 5$ but an additional bonus on top for their riskier work until you end up with the same pay ratio as before.

As far as efficient capital allocation and price discovery, that's an interesting, ongoint (and probably will be ever going) argument between active vs passive. In the end, both are necessary. Active investors subject themselves to alpha (both the good and bad side of alpha) while providing price discovery, and passive investors strengthen the beta and provide stability and steady inflows.

From there, they connected to/controlled a giant marionette. 

There were many ropes attached to the wrist but they were far enough away that No Single Person could control or coordinate them all because they were too far away - sometimes on opposite walls. 

You would think that with dozens of people just randomly pulling the ropes, the marionette would just move about jerkily. Instead this thing moved about gracefully - dancing with a mind of its own. 

Your comments about a Mega Bot made me think of this thing.

AAPL is worth $100. It drops down to $70 all of a sudden.

Stop loss: It triggers a market sell order when the stock drops below $95.

Stop limit: It triggers a sell order for EXACTLY $95. Since the stock dropped to $70 so quickly, no one is interested in your sell order of $95 as everyone else is selling it for $70 - $71. Congrats you are now a bagholder as you still have the stock.",['AAPL'],1
