the Company participated in a late-cycle meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) yesterday. During the meeting, the FDA shared issues still under review regarding the Company’s new drug application (“NDA”) for sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in patients with a quinolone non-susceptible pathogen and the Company responded to these issues. The FDA has determined that an Advisory Committee meeting is not currently necessary. The review of the NDA is ongoing and the Company was informed that the FDA continues to work toward the PDUFA goal date of July 25, 2021.

**Summary of $ITRM:** 

Iterum Therapeutics is a company that is creating a groundbreaking antibody (sulopenem) that has the potential to be the one and only version of itself. This antibody/antibiotic is going to be the only oral and intravenous branded penem available to the public. This is convenient for doctors because they do not have to prescribe multiple things to their patients but in return only prescribe one. This will fight multi drug resistant pathogens in the patient. The antibiotic will be available in oral and IV forms. Sulopenem is the first oral and IV penem antibiotic demonstrating a potent spectrum of activity against multi-drug resistant gram-negative infections in both the hospital and community settings.The company was founded by Corey N. Fishman on June 24, 2015 and is headquartered in Chicago.

“Iterum Therapeutics plc (US:ITRM) has 32 institutional owners and shareholders that have filed 13D/G or 13F forms with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). These institutions hold a total of 6,983,824 shares. Largest shareholders include Canaan Partners X LLC, Frazier Management Llc, New Leaf Venture Partners, L.L.C., Pivotal bioVenture Partners Investment Advisor LLC, Renaissance Technologies Llc, Citadel Advisors Llc, Ubs Oconnor Llc, Focused Wealth Management, Inc, Grimes & Company, Inc., and Summit Securities Group, Llc.”

&#x200B;

**FAIR VALUE**

$ITRM’s fair value is shown at around $2.56, and the stock is trading under $2, almost a full dollar under its fair value. The offering was announced at $2, and for the stock to be trading under that shows the oversold sentiment on the stock. 

&#x200B;

**Product**

“Iterum's antibiotic treatment Sulopenem displayed superiority over standard-of-care Cipro in uUTI patients with quinolone resistant pathogens. Iterum has submitted its NDA to the FDA, which has been accepted for priority review, with a decision date set for late July. Management are eyeing a potential $6.5bn market, and peak sales \~$1bn, but successful antibiotics treatments typically make sales \~$300m. Iterum stock has been on a recent bull run to \~$2.4, from $1.23, and if Sulopenem is approved, the share price ought to challenge May 20 highs of \~$4.2. Based on the positive endpoint from the SURE 1 trial of superiority to Cipro in patients with a quinolone non-susceptible pathogen, Iterum management filed a New Drug Application (""NDA"") in November last year for that indication, which was accepted by the FDA in late January for priority review, with a decision date set for July 25 - less than six months away. Management has experience developing and launching new antibiotic therapies with CEO Corey Fishman and Board Member Michael Dunne having developed Dalbavancin - a treatment for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (""ABSSSI"") at Durata Therapeutics, before selling the company to Actavis in a $675m deal in 2014. As such, with a major price catalyst on the horizon, an experienced management team, fresh funding and a large target market, Iterum stock's bull run could be set up to continue until it is challenging May '20 highs of >$4, or perhaps even its IPO price of $13, while an acquisition also provides an attractive exit strategy. Antibiotics is a difficult sector - a host of biotechs have gone bankrupt in the past decade after failing to make strong enough product sales in their first few years post-approval - but also one that often attracts government support, owing to the major pharmaceutical industry's reluctance to develop products for it. On balance, in relation to an investment into Iterum, I think the positives currently outweigh the negatives and that acquiring a position in the stock may reward patient, risk-on investors. In the rest of this article I will provide a little more colour on the company.” 

&#x200B;

**Sulopenem:** 

“Sulopenem belongs to a class of antibiotics known as ß-lactams, which includes Penicillin and Cephalosporins, which are active against gram-negative bacteria which cause urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections, amongst others. Iterum inherited the intravenous form of Sulopenem from Pfizer, and developed it into an oral formulation, known as sulopenem etzadroxil-probenecid.” 

 

**Marketing:** 

“Iterum's marketing strategy for Sulopenem will focus on the outpatient, rather than the hospital setting, and will be based on four key pillars. Advocacy campaigns to highlight a growing quinoline resistance problem, attempting to secure payer reimbursement from health plan providers and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (""PBMs"") (targeting >250m commercial and Medicare covered lives), sales force deployment in areas of high unmet need, and an education programme targeting physician awareness of bacterial resistance in certain regions.” 

 

**Analyst Ratings:**

**End Summary:** 

$ITRM has a lot of upside potential. All it really needs is a small catalyst to send the stock up. Its current catalyst is the approval that is scheduled to happen in July which would have $ITRM retest previous high of $4 from May 2020. $ITRM was close to testing this in February when it reached highs of around $3.25.  Iterum is ran by a phenomenal CEO who has over 25 years of experience in the Therapeutics/Pharmaceutical industries. Corey Fishman is an intelligent CEO who knows his company’s industry, and knows how to thrive in it. The breakthrough technology being presented by Iterum’s Sulopenem will create convenience not only to hospitals and doctors, but patients all around the world. $ITRM has a great “dip buy opportunity” as it is currently under its fair value presented by Morningstar Investment Research Center and it is trading under its $2 offering price. As for my consensus, I believe that $ITRM has great upside potential and will most likely surpass the $2 resistance mark within the coming days/weeks and squeeze shorts into sending this stock back to highs BEFORE the approval catalyst.",nmk3vo,[],1

166,2021-05-28,pennystocks,"Over the last few days I have been spreading the news that came out of Germany that a third party buyer had set up an offering to buy 200 million shares at the price of 59 cents per share.  That article can be found here...I would like to mention to those of you that don't bother to read the article, the offer was posted by the official publication of   the Department of Justice and Consumer Protection, of the Federal Republic of Germany.  **The offer closes June 30th, remember this date, it will be relevant again later on in the DD.**

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petroteq-comments-offer-appearing-german-070100457.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petroteq-comments-offer-appearing-german-070100457.html)

While that  news alone has caused quite a buzz over the last few days (the stock was up 320% since my first post at the high today), it seems as though people are struggling to understand why someone would want to purchase 200 million shares at over 10x the market price for a company that process' oil sands and hasn't been operational for over a month. I am seeing more and more inaccurate information pop up and FUD being spread so my hope is that I can clarify why the technology/patent that PQEFF owns is worth much more than 59 cents per share.  I am not an expert in this field so please bear with me if I butcher some of the oil terminology.

First things first lets look at update financials:

&#x200B;

[PQEFF Balance Sheet](https://preview.redd.it/4mzjqel81r171.png?width=353&format=png&auto=webp&s=7db4c9765874b6db9efbb8885241c0d66de82bfd)

With $78 million is assets and only $13 million in liabilities they have established a healthy balance sheet which alone makes the share value 25 cents on the low end. With a current market cap of $55 million they are trading under their asset value by quite a bit.

&#x200B;

Now lets talk tech and why the patent that PQEFF hold is so valuable:

&#x200B;

[PQEFF clean process](https://preview.redd.it/lrzzilv82r171.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=e74cf769e169c374a2b41bb0beab8198d137c602)

The patent is an international patent that includes Russia, the US, and Canada as seen here:

&#x200B;

[{PQEFF patent ](https://preview.redd.it/dro6y4kk2r171.png?width=354&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a41435a8775e6b6409ece820a58762dc68c813b)

Big oil is under fire to change to a much more green form of drilling and processing oil.  Technology that can not only alleviate environmental concerns but also be disruptive in their respective fields are coveted as they can create massive market disruption. Take a peak at this: 

[https://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/petroteq-has-developed-the-first-zero-waste-oil-sand-production-technology](https://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/petroteq-has-developed-the-first-zero-waste-oil-sand-production-technology)

Currently, PQEFF can pull up to 15% more oil out of the sand than conventional methods, all while creating no waste water. I believe the patented process that PQEFF has come up with is worth **WELL OVER $1 billion** and I think we arent the only ones that know it.  With insider buys as recent as May 5th, and no insider selling, its clear something MASSIVE is brewing here.  Keep in mind the market cap today is $55 million.  **With 464 million outstanding shares, a $1 billion market cap would put the share price at $2.15.**

 

[PQEFF insider 5\/5\/21](https://preview.redd.it/k38n4irf3r171.jpg?width=1915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be57e3f64346ad7531fc411f944eb0d71c980cea)

&#x200B;

[PQEFF list of insider holdings ](https://preview.redd.it/ksvw15rh3r171.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c6c62b20a21f1dca8ae396e107e8c3e2af12523)

These aren't exactly what you would call no named companies, Valkor with 60 million shares should be a massive endorsement. The red stars highlighted in the picture above are the two most recent buys as indicated in the SS of the Fintel report. When you start to put the pieces together, you start to realize that 200 million shares at 59 cents might not be such a bad deal after all.  I would like to add, if someone were to buy 200 million shares on the open market (over 75% of the current float and almost 50% of the total OS) the price would skyrocket well past $5 before they finished buying those shares.  59 cents may seem like an unbelievable offer, but when you consider the possibility that this could easily be trading above $2 in the very near future it doesn't seem so unbelievable, in fact its a robbery.

Today $PQEFF posted this news: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petroteq-energy-announces-production-oil-070100097.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petroteq-energy-announces-production-oil-070100097.html)

Remember earlier when I said remember **June 30th**, well....

&#x200B;

>The modified CO allows for processing and testing operations at the POSP to take place until **30 June 2021,** utilizing both local and offsite oil sands ore. Operation of the POSP after that date will be subject to Petroteq submitting an updated NOI before 1 July 2021, satisfactory to DOGM, covering sources of ore to be processed, mineral processing methods and facilities, management and handling of clean sand tailings, and a mine reclamation plan....  
>

>Continued...

>  
>  
>With this trial, the collection of test data, to better inform the design of the Company's proposed first 5,000 barrels per day (""**BPD**"") commercial production train, is now essentially complete. Until now, the Company's primary focus has been on data collection (testing of different oil sands ores, solvent concentrations and mix tank residence times) and not sustained commercial production from the POSP. The Company can now move to a focus on sustained production. A third party engineering firm has been engaged to review and certify the commerciality of Petroteq's Clean Oil Recovery Technology (""**CORT**"").  
>  
>A truckload of cleaned sand has now been collected by a nearby drilling fluids company for evaluation and testing. The initial evaluation of the sand was positive and indications are that they will collect additional sand tailings for further evaluation, processing and possible sale.  
>  
>George Stapleton, Petroteq COO, commented: ""DOGM's decision to modify the CO so as to allow POSP operations to resume pending the submission of an updated, revised NOI is very much appreciated. Data gathering for the design of a 5,000 BPD commercial production train should be completed shortly, which will allow for a shift to production operations.""

&#x200B;

This is where it gets a little tinfoil hat... but if you're asking me it is no coincidence that the share offering is closing the same day that the results are due.  If they are able to show that they can operate at 5000 BPD they will be looking at pulling **5000 x $67/barrel x 30 days = $10.05 million per month or $120 million a year.** Suddenly a $1 billion dollar market cap and share price of $2.15 doesn't seem so outrageous.  

We have seen more than 20 tickers this year run well beyond a $1 billion market cap, and almost all of them were speculative plays with very little revenue.  There is no reason that a company with this level of institutional interest/ownership, limited liabilities, and patented technology cant reach that level and more.  

Last thing I will say is lets look at the chart: 

&#x200B;

[5 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/xej5yw0pxr171.jpg?width=1447&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0f92828646e6098771a74655427ee635019c540)

As you can see the RSI has cooled off quite a bit which was needed after two big days, we had a huge gap between 11 cents and 14 cents that we needed to fill. This is about as healthy of growth as you can ask for when you're talking about 200%-300% growth in a matter of days. I unloaded some shares at 17 cents and I purchased them back at 11c and 10.44c.  If/when the next PR drops this thing is going to go nuclear.  This is not a pump and dump, this is a real black swan event in the making and I am happy to be sharing this DD with all of you.

**Maths! Earnings!** Numbers provided on ZENS' Investor presentation, **I'm filling the gaps**.

*Processing img 2msukv558s171...*

Coating volume once ramped up (currently pilot stage) will be \~800million coated units per month \~2.4 billion per quarter. Earnings per unit provides **$0.03-$0.06** cents per unit giving **$2.19-$4.38 EPS** for 99,000,000 diluted shares with 24% corporate tax rate. This provides fair **2-3 year** **SP range of $30-$60** at full production capacity (upper end wont occur until we collapse our cost structure to enhance the unit margins).

Glove coatings at **$0.01-$0.04** per unit would add around **+$0.30-$1.20 EPS**, HVAC filters with coating at **$1.00-$4.00** per unit would provide **+$0.08-$0.30 EPS**. This adds onto the **max** 2-3 year SP range by **$5-$18 result in $35 - $70** on earnings from combined PPE & HVAC market penetration. We are currently expected to be at 32 million coatings per month by end of June. That is an annual rate of 384 million disregarding the ramping-up, providing **by June a floor EPS \~0.11 Justifying minimum of $4** if current extrinsic share price is allotted. November is when full production is expected. At least a full year or two will be required to prove earnings, stabilizing intrinsic share price.

A similar material to ZENGuard**™** is being tested toward [therapeutic usage](https://www.zengraphene.com/zen-graphene-solutions-announces-ingestion-good-laboratory-practice-study-for-its-graphene-based-compound/) within the human body. Therapeutic would disrupt portions of a massive industry so it's hard to take into account. We will see resistance from this sector, so do not expect this to happen quietly or easily. This is where the true speculative value of ZGS will be. If they can pull off ZENGuard™ they can redouble toward therapeutic and disrupt sectors of pharmaceuticals that have poor adaptability.

It kills superbugs, partially solving a present and future problem. Bacteria/viruses/fungi can't really adapt out of silver. It destroys the cells by lysis, so, if adopted, we may not see the problem we've seen caused by the overuse of antibiotics. Human/animal cells have more and thicker membranes, protecting them from lytic destruction. DNA I'm not too sure the effects toward, but should be minimal if any. Testing will confirm and is ongoing.

**Great!.. What are we waiting for?**

A health advisory published April 2nd by Health Canada brought to light a series of unwarranted masks which were introduced into the markets late last spring, as to take advantage of the Covid-19 virus without safety testing or certification. These masks allegedly contained Graphene, causing a obvious holdup for our graphene-based coating for masks. Further info has been sent to HC and secondary testing is now underway & awaiting results.

The major problem thus far with graphene markets, isn't about creating the tech, it has been about showing and exposing people to how effective small amounts of graphene are in improving already existing products. It's been shown that Graphene is a great additive for many applications, and provides **large efficiency bonuses from small % addition**, but many IP needs introduction to market or to create the markets. ZEN has done very well with getting reach arounds from companies; Board has alluded to other PPE + Filtration manufacturers expressing interest so keep posted. TreborRx has an **LOI** agreement to collaborate on a minimum 100,000,000 masks so it is not an expressly permanent agreement by any means.

They are sitting on $4mil cash from previous offering. Cash burn of \~1.5mil per quarter while setting up production infrastructure. Either **expect success out of ZENGuard™** or **be ready for a little more dilution/warrants**.

Some may be worried ZENGuard ™ is only a good product for pandemic circumstances however this is a product with no competition, it is an application to already existing products. Better PPE/Filters would only benefit everyone in the future IMO, not to mention its other applications as a coating!

As ZEN is currently a pre-revenue company investors should expect news relating to Health Canada, Bantrel engineering, or developments on HVAC coatings very shortly. ZEN has been a bit of a sleeping giant the past few months, with many pieces in the pipeline - breaking news has been around the corner for some time!",nmp247,[],0

310,2021-05-28,pennystocks,"AMC stock has been soaring in recent days. Today, the stock closed at a share price of $26.52. I believe the stock price can rise to $100,000 per share in the coming days. The reasons for this are stated below in the explanation. 

Explanation:
1. AMC is officially off the bankruptcy zone, thanks to the over $2 billion equity and debt capital the company currently has. The capital can last the company for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the risk of bankruptcy makes investors confident. This will likely further drive up stock prices as more investors buy the stock.
2. AMC's recent rise in market value and share price increases have been largely driven by Reddit investors who the company says own over 80% of the company's over 480 million shares outstanding. We can expect the price to keep soaring as Reddit and other social media-based investors keep making the company's stock more and more popular on social media. 
3. AMC stock will likely rise to $100,000 due to the ongoing short squeeze to force short-sellers such as hedge funds to cover their losses. Short-sellers have already made millions of dollars in losses and as the short squeeze continues, share prices are expected to grow. 
4. AMC stock is one of the most shorted stocks at the moment. The fact that the stock is shorted makes it more likely for share prices to keep increasing as short-sellers are forced to abandon their positions and cover losses. 
5. AMC theaters are back in business after movie theater closures due to Covid regulations. The company's movie theaters are already selling out all their tickets, thereby attracting investors who see hope for the industry and expect profits to grow as the economy continues to reopen. 
6. AMC's CEO Adam Aron is inspiring the Reddit investors to continue supporting the stock and become customers by going to its movie theaters. The CEO has gone ahead to increase his online activities on Twitter to engage the investors and listen to their concerns. The continuous appreciation of the online-based investors by the company's CEO will likely push the stock price higher in the coming days. 
7. Recent price declines in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have caused some investors to abandon cryptocurrencies and join the ongoing AMC stock frenzy. Given that AMC is now part of the so-called meme stock, it is likely that some of the capital leaving the cryptocurrency market is being invested in meme stocks. AMC is one of the best meme stocks for these investors at the moment. Therefore, further declines in crypto prices will probably attract more investors, thereby driving up AMC stock prices. 
8. Big companies such as the Vanguard Group are currently buying AMC stock. The fact that big companies are willing to buy rather than sell the stock shows that they believe in a positive future for the company. These big companies encourage other institutional investors to buy the stock, thereby increasing stock prices. 
9. Recent announcements by the Securities Exchange Commission that it is reviewing short-selling rules to properly protect small investors may also be a factor in contributing to further increases in AMC stock prices. If small investors know that the SEC will establish rules to protect them from the short positions adopted by hedge bets, then more small investors may be inclined to invest in AMC stock effectively increasing share prices. 
10. Recent battles between small online-based investors such as those on Reddit and large hedge funds who mostly take on short positions (short-sellers) that result in job losses are also driving up and will keep driving up AMC stock. Online-based investors continue to develop a liking for shorted stocks in order to stick it up to big hedge funds. Besides, AMC is currently one of the most held stocks at the moment. This will keep driving up share prices.

378,2021-05-28,pennystocks,"Ovid Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company, which engages in the development of medicines for patients and families living with rare neurological disorders. The company was founded by Matthew During in April 2014 and is headquartered in New York, NY.

Currently the share price is $4.22 and the market capitalization is $286 million Price/Earnings ratio is around 2.

Why is OVID a great investment opportunity?

OVID announced the closing of the Royalty, License and Termination agreement (the “Agreement”) under which Takeda Pharmaceutical secured global rights from Ovid to develop and commercialize the investigational medicine soticlestat (TAK-935/OV935) for the treatment of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, including Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. OVID received an upfront payment of $196 million and is eligible to receive up to an additional $660 million upon achieving development, regulatory and sales milestones. In addition, OVID will receive tiered double-digit royalties, up to 20 percent on sales of soticlestat, if approved and commercialized. Takeda has assumed sole responsibility for further worldwide development and commercialization, and Ovid no longer has any financial obligation to Takeda under the original collaboration agreement, including for milestone payments or any future development and commercialization costs.

**First Quarter 2021 Financial Results**

&#x200B;

* Revenue      of $208.4 million was recognized during the first quarter of 2021, as      compared to zero for the same period in 2020. Revenue recognition was in      relation to the receipt of the one-time upfront payment of $196.0 million      pursuant to Ovid’s agreement with Takeda, and $12.4 million recognized in      connection with the termination of the license and collaboration agreement      with Angelini Pharma. 

· Research and development expenses were $16.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, as compared $14.6 million for the same period in 2020. The increase of $1.6 million included a decrease in preclinical and development expenses for the clinical studies of OV101 and an increase in Takeda collaboration expenses related to soticlestat.

· General and administrative expenses were $15.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, as compared to $5.7 million for the same period in 2020. The increase of $9.9 million was primarily due to an increase in legal fees and professional fees of $8.8 million, which includes $8.2 million of one-time fees related to the Takeda License and Termination Agreement.

· Net income was $176.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 resulting in basic net income per share of $2.55 and diluted net income per share of $2.53. Net loss was $20.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, resulting in basic and diluted net loss per share of $0.37. Net income for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021 was attributable to a one-time upfront payment of $196.0 million pursuant to Ovid’s agreement with Takeda, and $12.4 million recognized in connection with the termination of the license and collaboration agreement with Angelini Pharma.

So OVID has a first quarter net income almost at the level of its market capitalization and if OVID receives the additional $660 million expected, it will have received 4 times its market capitalization. 

So I think OVID is really undervalued. Since the earnings release a week ago, the stock has only gained 10% and is at $4.22while quarterly earnings per share is $2.53.

Graphically there is resistance at $4.50-5.00$ and once this resistance is broken the upside can be huge. There is still time to invest.

OCUP has had 4 evaluations by analysts in 2021, so these are recent, and all have given it a target price above 20. That would multiply the current price by roughly five. An any time we can have an investment multiply that way, it's worth looking into it.

So before anyone claims I'm a pumper: this is a super small clinical stage pharma (not a pennystock though) with a small pipeline running mostly on one product/idea, at least in the near future. It's a risky investment. Do your own D/D. Also, tomorrow they are hosting a webinar, so you can listen firsthand and form an opinion. 

Now for the D/D. Why are all analysts so optimistic about OCUP?

Well, anyone that has ever gone to the ophthalmologist to have their eyes/eyesight examined, will understand this one.

When we go to the eye dr., we are given eyedrops to enlarge our pupil. The black part of the eye. The black part of the eye, is like a hole. So the larger the hole, the better look the doctor can have into our eye. This is a VERY simplified explanation.

It takes at least 25 minutes for our pupil to dilate. After the exam, (anyone who has experienced it knows this), it takes a few hours for it to get back to normal. During those hours, we can't see well, our vision is blurred, we can't read a book, watch a screen or drive a car.

Some of us just take a bus home and wait it out. But for many of us, that time with blurred vision means we are going to miss more hours of work. That recovery time is worth money.

Well, currently there is no solution for this situation. You go to the eye doctor, your pupil is dilated, then you waist several hours after the visit waiting for your eyesight to recover.

OCUP have developed the eyedrops antidote. Very simple: eyedrops you receive at the end of the visit, which will bring your sight back to normal within roughly the same time frame it took for the pupil to dilate (about 20-25 minutes).

What this means is, anyone, worldwide, that goes to consult with an ophthalmologist, everyday, any day, that's the market for this product. 100 million visits pe year in the USA alone. And there is no alternative. They will OWN that market. Just imagine this: a product that every eye dr. around the world will have that will drastically improve the patient's experience by simply receiving some eyedrops that bring the eyesight to normal. You can go back to work, use the computer, drive etc.

That alone, is a good enough reason for betting on OCUP. That's worth billions. But it actually gets way better for four reasons:

1. This product has other uses, we are not going to get into all of them because they refer to more specific eye issues.
2. They are in Phase three, using a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.
3. There is an additional HUGE use for this product.
4. The current market cap is very very low.

What the 505 pathway basically means is that the active ingredient, the main ingredient of this new product has already received FDA approval, twice. So what OCUP does is use the data that already exists about this compound to avoid a lengthy approval path. In other words: it makes the approval of the product way faster. And after 7 very successful trials involving over 200 patients, they are in the last stages of moving towards an approval request (which, as explained, can be obtained much faster). So we are talking about approved product this year.

As for the other huge market for OCUP. OCUP is using the same technology they developed to apply it, with slight changes of course, to different situations. One such situation is presbyopia. Don't let the name scare you, it's very simple: the need for reading glasses. Pretty much everyone who reaches a certain age needs reading glasses. It's part of the process of getting old. Almost 2 billion people worldwide suffer from it. That's how big the market is.

OCUP are again, creating something that doesn't really exist: eyedrops that will ""cure"" or delay presbyopia. Basically they can avoid, if not totally then partially, the need for reading glasses, simply by using eyedrops. A huge market, also with no real competitors.

There is more to write about OCUP and it's small but amazing pipeline. But just these things I mention is the reason I personally loved this find. I'm slowly increasing my position and waiting. It's a long position. It's not a company that creates huge news. So this is about buying cheap now and waiting. If the analysts are roughly right, we can quadruple our investment within 12 months. I'll take it.",nkrbpf,[],0

I wanted to share with you a potential catalyst for $CTIC.   It is a baby bio that has submitted a NDA for their drug Pacritinib.  It is a treatment for Myelofibrosis, which is a form of Leukemia.   

The rolling NDA submission was completed on March 31st, which started the 60 day clock for the FDA to accept/deny the submission and determine priority.   That 60 day clock runs out on Sunday and $CTIC has scheduled a meeting at market close on June 1st.

534,2021-05-28,pennystocks,"Announced this morning Sienna Resources has started to drill on the Bleka project in Norway. This project located in a past producing are where 200M of the 3000M strike zone was mined prior to WW2.  A total of approximately 1,500 metres will be drilled on this phase of drilling. The Bleka vein was discovered in 1880 and mined intermittently until 1940. The historic Bleka vein is hosted in a deformed greenstone belt in southern Norway and was formed during two phases of quartz-veining events. Auriferous quartz veins characteristically contain Cu-Bi (copper-bismuth) and tourmaline. Compilation of historic reports combined with  reconnaissance mapping revealed a series of underexplored vein swarms on the Bleka property that will be tested on this drill program. 

This is an exciting time to be looking at Sienna as it has only begun its work program for the year and if you pay attention to mining exploration companies and their cycles, well then you know this is when you want to be looking at them. I have 100k shares. Do some DD. I am not an advisor.

543,2021-05-28,pennystocks,"Hey guys,

I invite you to look at this stock as it might be flying under the radar. A lot of this info comes from the presentation they released yesterday (link: [https://player.vimeo.com/video/554778399](https://player.vimeo.com/video/554778399) ) and  I strongly recommend to watch it to get a better picture of the company and their products. Just a heads up, I don't think you can make a quick buck here. In my opinion, this is a long-term investment akin to MVIS, if you bought it years ago.

Enter Lightwave Logic Inc. (OTCQX: LWLG) -   a technology platform company, leveraging its proprietary technology  platform to develop next-generation electro-optic polymers which  increase the efficiency of internet infrastructure by converting data  into optical signals, allowing more data to be transmitted at  significantly higher speeds and with less power than existing solutions.

The Company’s current focus is on the datacom and telecommunications hardware supply chain for the 100 Gbps and 400 Gbps fiber optics  communications market, seeking to integrate its proprietary materials  into the devices that comprise key components in today’s internet  infrastructure. Lightwave Logic’s unique value proposition, including  ease of manufacture relative to traditional solutions, has driven  **several tier-1 and tier-2** potential strategic partners in the data and  telecommunications markets to enter into non-disclosure agreements  (NDAs) with Lightwave Logic to evaluate its technology for use in their  devices, validating the demand for the Company’s solution in the  marketplace. The Company expects to introduce its technology into the  commercial marketplace in the near future.

In plain English, they design hardware that allows to transmit data faster and in larger volumes, a need, that is growing by the day. Just think by how much this industry has grown in the last year since the pandemic started. A lot of companies have shifted from office to the work-from-home model. In other words, I believe this is the right time to bet on this industry.

Some good moments I personally find very attractive:

* One thing I read that I really liked is that they have in-house materials synthesis, device/package design, wafer fabrication and testing capabilities at its Englewood, Colorado headquarters, which basically means they don't depend as much on widely accepted supply-outsourcing standards.
* They uplisted from OTCQB to OTCQX in Dec. 2020 and they did it without any share manipulation, which exposed the stock to a larger market audience. Next, they plan on moving up to Nasdaq and most of the requirements have been already met (see below). All they need to hit is a higher PPS, which should be achievable considering the smart leading team and recent achievements.

&#x200B;

* The management team seems to be very level-headed and doesn't throw out a lot of buzz word news to pump and dump. Just look at some of the people on the board: [https://www.lightwavelogic.com/about-us/leadership/](https://www.lightwavelogic.com/about-us/leadership/)

The CEO is a knowledgeable and recognized expert in the industry.  His career started with the British Government in 1977 in  telecommunications and he did research at their prestigious labs (RSRE  Malvern) in the early 1980s and worked at AT&T Bell Labs (1985-1989)  in photonics. At Motorola in the 1990s he drove the development,  including co-authorship of the first patent, of the oxide VCSEL diode  laser which is now used in laser mice, 3D sensing/FaceID in mobile  phones, optical interconnects with volumes over 1B units. From 2005-2010  he led the USA trade association in optoelectronics (OIDA) and  represented the optoelectronics industry on Capitol Hill. He has run  technical start-ups and commercialized optoelectronic and photonics  technology into manufacturing. He was voted PIC (Photonic Integrated  Circuit) business leader of the year by the PIC International Conference  in 2018. He is a technical expert to the European Commission and a  Fellow of IEEE and OSA. 

Not so great moments:

* The company is not yet generating any revenue. They have been developing their product for years and the time to commercialize it is coming soon.
* Hard to assess their ability to market the product although they do claim to have been working with some tier 1 and tier 2 potential partners.

I wish I understood more about the product itself but I don't have any technical background so I still have a lot of digging to fully understand the picture by piecing together whatever bits I find on the internet. Right now, I'm relying on feedback and opinions of the public. If any of you has any expertise in it, please chime in! here is a link to their white papers: [https://www.lightwavelogic.com/resource-center/technical-presentations-white-papers/](https://www.lightwavelogic.com/resource-center/technical-presentations-white-papers/)",nmy5e3,[],1

618,2021-05-28,pennystocks,"$IQST has announced that a launch is coming, which is the best type of news headline in my opinion. There's 2 things that are necessary to watch for here:

1) the news about when they announce what day the launch will be

2) the run up for a pump and dump play that will occur due to this

I am not a huge fan of the chart $IQST has behind them right now I'll admit it. There's no bottom stabilization and no consolidation period which makes this a risky play. Why am I so confident though? Because there is an almost guaranteed chance for a news headline release to occur within the coming weeks which means even if it goes down 20% in the meantime it'll be made up on that day. I am willing to risk here in order to get in early and DCA more in if it goes lower and try and gobble a 2x and get out.

I'm expecting a large spike when they release that on June XX the launch date will occur. I'm also expecting a run up in the coming weeks while people buy the rumor and sell the news.

Been wanting to see a gambling app more dedicated to specifically E-sports and I think I found a good one. Although e-sports has been integrated into betting apps such as Bet 365, Draft Kings, and others, I feel like it's always taken a back seat to live sports and thus can create a barrier to entry for some non-traditional sports fans. That is why Fandom is different.

Fandom Sports can be used via a mobile app or online website. On the platform, you will see that streaming services like twitch have been integrated so you can view any available event without having to go into a third-party application. Once the user is viewing a game there are several features that become available to them, such as social features and betting features. If a player wants to make a wager, **They** set the parameters of the wager and other individuals can join in. The AI tech that Fandom has been developing makes it so the possibilities of different types of wagers are truly massive.

Recently they expanded their server capacity which bodes well for the upcoming release. The new servers will allow for large amounts of traffic as they expect the usage to be high upon launch. Another positive of these servers is that they increase the security of users' data as they will not require to use of third-party servers. Finally, part of Fandom's plan for launch is to distribute some NFT's to users for performing actions in-app. This will help attract new users, and the new servers increase minting efficiency of these NFT's.

However, shorts (over half the float) brought it down so much that not only did it lose its gains, it went down over 10 percent near its all time low.  Currently they are barely holding the 1.40 wall, but can’t imagine holding too much longer.  I already bought some shares but can anyone see it going significantly lower.",nn2u8s,[],0

-Akebia Submits New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for Vadadustat for the Treatment of Anemia Due to Chronic Kidney Disease in Adult Patients on Dialysis and Not on Dialysis on March 30th. This is a 3 billion dollar market opportunity.

-The FDA has 60 days to approve or deny the application. Today is the 59th day... They were denied before in September 2020 so people are still cautious. But that was under a different admnistration that apparently just denied drugs for the fun of it.

-Since then researchers evaluating whether an investigational oral drug, vadadustat, can help prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients were awarded $5.1 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to expand the Phase II clinical trial in January. I dont think the government funds drugs that wouldn't meet FDA standard. 

-Their largest competitor ,$FGEN, were recently scrutinized for their unconventional data and even had their data retracted from a scientific journal, plummeting their shares from a high of $55 to $20, where they sit now.

-Akebia's data is robust and they have been transparent about it from the beginning and have been meeting with the FDA. They also brought on a heavy hitter to help with government regulations: LeAnne M. Zumwalt to its Board of Directors, effective February 16, 2021. Ms. Zumwalt was most recently Group Vice President, Government Affairs at DaVita Inc., one of the largest providers of dialysis and kidney care services in the United States.

-Vadadustat is already being sold in Japan since last year and Akebia's 2020 revenue was 300 million. How is this stock $3?

TLDR: With this NDA catalyst and weakness in their competitors Akebia should switch share prices with FGEN and possibly beat them to market with a life changing drug.",nmxpbg,[],1
