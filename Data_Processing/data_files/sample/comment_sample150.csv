- this App has a small audience who is mostly Indian. They market them selves as middle eastern but India is not Middle East. When you check the Middle East rooms, they are dead empty. And the Indian ones are paid users talking random shit.

If you are confident and good with your perception, its possible to make some decent consistent money, but you will ALWAYS win and lose some. If you go all in and reinvest your income, you might win big the first time, and win big for the next five times, but all it takes is one all in where you lose and say bye bye to 80 to 90% of your money. So if you go in always do so with a fixed amount, maybe 10% of initial portfolio.",[],0

The year is 2001. You‚Äôre at a Chinese restaurant.Your uncle puts extra walnuts in your portion of shrimp. Sweet !

The year is 2008. You're a kid at a Chinese restaurant with your family. While waiting for the food to come, you entertain yourself by looking at fish and prawns and crabs in their tanks. Life's good.

The year is 2019. You‚Äôre walking at night down a chilly city street when you see the glow of the Chinese restaurant that you used to go to with your family. You don‚Äôt know what comes over you, but you decide to go in. The waitstaff are different but the flavors are the same. It reminds you of a simpler time. And for a moment, you‚Äôre not alone anymore.

The year is 2056. You sit back at a big round table at a new Chinese restaurant after dinner, slightly tipsy. Around the table are your family. Your children, all grown up now and sitting close to their partners. Your grandchildren are chattering away, playing with toys in their laps. You never thought that you would get to this point, but here you are. You lean back in your seat and relax. Your belly is full, as is your heart. Finally.

The year is 2057. The dementia progressed rapidly. Who are these people anyway? Food

The year is 2058. Shjslabdn Dim sum

The year is 2059. Your family gathers around your casket, celebrating your life, remembering the days you spent together. They commune at the chinese restaurant your family has been going to for nearly 80 years. A cure for Alzheimer's was found 2 weeks later.

-after the merger, discovery will buy/own 70% of all its stock and existing discovery shareholders will own 30% via fully diluted basis

Low float, great social media development team, owns 2 ad companies, will put immediate pressure on Bytedance and tiktok market($ 250Billion and $ 50 Billion respectively)

I'm holding because I believe, through hundreds of hours of reading and learning, that shorts never covered their original position and have instead dug a deeper hole. I believe it's to the point now where Citadel (a market maker), is forced to sell a share short for every share bought in the name of providing liquidity. I believe that retail owns HUNDREDS of % of the remaining float, and that a squeeze of epic proportions is coming, promoted by:

The DTCC, OCC, SEC, NSCC (all of which have created rules in the last 2 months which shelter themselves from a market fallout)
 
GME is conducting their annual shareholder vote in 3 weeks. When this happens, I believe they will tell their stakeholders that their voter turnout is indeed, hundreds of % of the outstanding shares. This will ultimately prove that shorts never covered.

I believe the Repo market is completely fucked, and banks are on the brink of yet another liquidity crisis which will happen before summer. This is partially due to the QE ending on Mar 31, as well as terrible money management by banks and hedge funds, who thought they could bankrupt certain companies that they thought wouldn't survive covid. Rehypothocated shares (shares borrowed, sold in the market which are then lent out and sold numerous times) have created a scenario where retail knows they hold the float and won't sell until they see share prices that look like phone numbers.",['GME'],0

FYI I'm a high schooler so I don't really understand much, and I'm not very good with the technical terms. From the \~50% short ratio, I'm assuming \~50% of the shares are currently being shorted. Due to the relatively low amount of shares being traded, it would be hard to buy back all at once.

 Assuming the above is correct, my question would be if the short sellers wanted to buy back what they shorted, it would be very hard without pushing the price up a lot I believe. In my opinion, this could lead to a very dangerous bubble for this stock. Do you think this scenario is plausible?

‚Äúhow can I enable options and buy calls on everything ‚ÄúI just changed my settings now what‚Äù 

It‚Äôs astonishing. Firstly the dude wasn‚Äôt even talking to him he was having a conversation w someone else, and was making a joke, and some guy who creeps this sub literally responds thinking it‚Äôs real and follows everything he says without knowing anything about him or the topic, and not realizing it‚Äôs a joke.

Like do yourself a huge fucking favor if you know so little about a topic that you can‚Äôt distinguish a joke from real life then don‚Äôt creep on a sub you know nothing about and risk your money. If this was a health sub his joke would translate to stocks to health like him saying to smoke 5 packs of cigarettes a day to improve cardiovascular health, and the guy who has no idea on the topic responds being like okay I just bought a carton of cigarettes now how do I smoke them?

Magnite will continue to be fintwit darling because there is a Wedbush analyst who had called it a TTD in the making, which I thought was horse sheet. Pubmatic's margins are great and the fact that they are profitable puts them in a niche category of IPOs right along with Good Rx, Zoom Info, Olo, etc. I am continuing to accumulate shares on weakness. I see them being a $10B company in the next 5-10 years. They hired away Spotify executive to take care of CTV business and then hired another lady from Disney Hulu.

Firstly o researched the average penis size worldwide which was reported to be 5.16 inches when erect. Based on this I found out what the average height was in the swampy country of Rwanda, the data shows the average hieght is 5ft 2 inches. With this data I calculated that the average penis is 12.0155% of the human body in Rwanda.  
  
Using this data I searched up what is shreks height, the most common answer was 8ft (96 inches) based on the findings of my previous data I calculated that shreks dick is 11.53 inches.  
  
This lead to me wondering what Fiona (shreks wife) height was as she must have been ruined pre ogre transformation, based on my research she was 5.10 meaning that pre shrek transformation she was taking ogre dick account for over 19% of her height!",[],0

Sell 10x covered call at 10$ strike for = $700 which is 82 shares (at current price). Which is 94 free shares, buy 6 more shares with deposit and then you have 1100 shares, 100 are almost free. Now you still have 100 shares of profit to the upside over $10 . Or the contracts expire worthless and you have 100 shares. The trick is to sell the premium on the runups and get the shares at a cheaper price so you can make 100 shares without deposit. Next time you will make $110 in divy + whatever you sell 11 contracts for. (If you keep the shares) If you get the same amount which was 11 x $70 = (770 +110 = 880) = or 100 shares at 8.80 each and total shares to 1200 (which make even more next time). In this way your investment will compound, or you sellem all at way more than you bought them.  Rinse and repeat. Then once a year Every year put some divy and premium back for your taxes. Worst case is if it runs up to $20, then you have to sell your shares for more than you bought them (If you don't buy the calls back) but not what people are willing to pay.",[],0

6287,gywkmec,2021-05-21,t1_gywftg5,wallstreetbets,"There are a number of factors that go into an option‚Äôs price. The easiest one is the intrinsic value which for a put which equals the strike minus the price of the underlying (if it‚Äôs less than 0 the intrinsic value is 0) so in this case 210 - 170 = 40. And it represents 100 shares so 40*100= 4,000. It‚Äôs the value you make if you immediately exercised the option and then sold all the shares. 

The remaining factors that go into an option‚Äôs price are collectively called extrinsic value. The two main ones are time value and implied volatility. The more time till expiration an option has, the more time for the price of the underlying to move and the more time for the option to appreciate in value. So when you buy an option you pay the seller for all of the extrinsic value. As you get closer to expiration that extrinsic value will start to disappear and the time value of the option will slowly fall off. Look up more about theta if you want to learn about that. Options thats are out of the money time value decays faster, options in the money time value decays slower. 

The other big one is implied volatility which is a measure of how much the price of the underlying is expected to move. When he bought this, gamestop was moving like crazy, the implied volatility was through the roof. When he purchased that option, he had to pay the seller for that volatility. Well now the price bas calmed down so the volatility has disappeared and lots of time has passed so time value has devoured most of the value of this option. 

Like it says above he needs gamestop to be at $70.20 by expiration for this to break even. Or he needs this to absolutely tank in the coming months for some delta movement in his favor and for iv to pick back up.",[],0

retail traders can make money in the lottery (if they win the jackpot) or at a slot machine (if they win) or using options trades (if they win), but it's just luck, more often you lose money, so their advice is correct.

First off 'customer first' is the standard big corps adhere to but there is customer first and EXCEPTIONAL customer first.

\-Ryan turned Chewy into multi billion dollar company that is better than even amazon when it comes to pet stuff.

\-IIRC someone quote Ryan as saying ""if you have a choice of making some extra money or delighting a customer always delight the customer""

\-Poster talked about how her dog died and chewy legit sent her flowers or some shit

\-Gamestop was having a ton of issues with customer service.  Ryan Cohen personally emailed a customer about some return policy that the customer was stuck in a months long cycle with 'old' GME with

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-gamestop-cohen-insight-idUSKBN2BF1AS

\-Same day delivery-- they use doordash to deliver items to customers.  Sick.

The company pays the real shares the dividend, the synthetics get paid by the creators of the synthetic. You slowly drain them of their money.

That‚Äôs why so many companies exist to bring you food, or drinks, or drive you around. Digital is all fine, until it isn‚Äôt. 

There will also be collectors, and traders in games and products. 

It‚Äôs easy to say avenues will close, but inventive people find ways around that. A lot more people want gamer stuff. The comfort, and the quickness. 

I doubt Nintendo sells chairs, headsets, and gear. 

It won‚Äôt just be T-shirts, there‚Äôs a lot that belongs to being a hardcore gamer. 

People need to stop making GME dead, and acting like in the future gaming magically exists because you can download the game. 

It would cost Nintendo more to set up their own warehouses for distribution of their systems than just allowing another retailer to have them for sale, and let that cost burden be on them. 

If GME was smart they would have talks about being the only ones who can warehouse their systems and do same day delivery.

The formula for compound interest is

P (1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where P is the initial principal balance (or in this case the current price) r is the interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per time period and t is the number of time periods. 

So 2059 is 38 years from now
I will use the 100 day moving average, which is 394.46

So,

394 (1 + .1/1) ^ (1√ó38)


394 (1.1) ^ (38)

394 √ó 37.404343

Stop attacking an argument no one is making, it doesnt make your argument look better. Capitalism has strengths and I'm not saying it, or inequality, should go away. I'm saying when the difference between the 0th percentile and 99th percentile is roughly the same as 99th to 100th, maybe we need to think about some adjustments. Neither extreme allows for functioning liberal markets...

The economy IS zero sum almost by definition, and the sum is of the total output of the societies work. That's literally a fundamental underpinning of economics not to mention fairly basic if not necessarily obvious. The pie grows when the society either becomes more efficient (technological advances or increased specialization) or accesses new wealth (undiscovered resources or new demand for current resources).

I'm not arguing capitalism is bad, and capitalism requires inequality imho so I'm not saying that's innately bad either. With no value judgement i'm saying inequality, according to researchers, is among or possibly the highest it's ever been in human history. 

Separately, I'm starting that I believe the return on inequality is not infinite. Specifically, it would be more efficient if less of the wealth created by society was substantially removed from the economy and instead went to people who would spend it on goods and services allowing the economy to more effectively function. Not saying inequality should go away, saying there's no difference between no inequality and absolute inequality if you look at the bottom 99.9% and without inequality between where you are and where you could get capitalism fails.",[],0

From the top: The date the call expires or can be exercised on.
The price ($300) the shares can be purchased for on that date.

The 9.25 is what there shares are worth right now per the calls value.

Position quantity of 33 is 33 calls worth 100 shares each. So 3,300 shares.

The cost is what they paid to buy these calls (someone else is putting their owned shares on the line at $300 on this date regardless of the current market value of the share). They paid $79,518.57.

The value of their calls have dropped in value by $48,993.57 and are now worth $30,525. (3,300 shares times $9.25 =)

If on july 16, the shares are worth $350 each, he exercises his calls and buys 3,300 shares for $30 each and then can immediately turn around and sell them for $350-$300= $50 *3,300 shares = $165,000 - initial cost ($79,518.57) = $85,481.43 profit.

The beauty of SPCE is with VG being the parent company, they can pay expenses down to show better figures on 10Q until they're operational. There will be opinions for this as being good and bad, but it doesn't show as negative in the short term.

But when ever single automaker is pledging to go electric you don‚Äôt ha w to be a genius to figure out that they may do a better job the. Tesla 

Here‚Äôs the thing though and I‚Äôve done no research other tbe. Driving my wife‚Äôs Tesla .  I realized sometbing, that if I were to keep driving I would soon need to return home to charge or visit a (conveniently amd 10 years of building out ) Tesla super charger

Then I thought about it, I said I have a Porsche hybrid , if I needed to charge it and there was no gas available , what would I do, call an Uber or my wife .

delivered the power via truck


So while everyone sis out there making batteries And bullshit to compete with Tesla and Elon.  By the way he told nasa they were doing this shit all wrong and now they call him to go up there , also you‚Äôll find a Tesla floating up there because you‚Äôll find a super charger up there . 

This is 100 percent my opinion and my experience and I live in in the suburbs on NYC , we don‚Äôt ha w many super charges like in California, also my wife drives 29 miles round trip everyday cost us about a bucks a day .  But if she ever needed a charge , I would have no choice but to go get her .

It‚Äôs not a miney thjng it‚Äôs an infrastructure thing it‚Äôs your local and state and federal government, your power grid your local power company etc etc

So here‚Äôs the question,can anyone catch Elon.

Usually big start ups or big corps gets about 1.5-3 years before they get copied by the competitor .  There‚Äô are a few instances I. The recent past that have shown if any company gets further away then that time frame .  (Without Elon who builds reusable rockets electro. Cars chips for human brains , boring trucks to bore underground highways, and solar energy , but is 9 years late in the energy consumed and how its produces to mine it) 
You get the amazon effect

The ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a terrible idea. ThT will never work, what? free shipping , what ?electric cars, what ? Profits what? Margins what. ? ‚Äú

‚ÄúYeah okay the bug guys will eat you alive they‚Äôve been at this whole retail/ car thing forever ‚Äú


And then you wake up to 3 trillion dollar market cap between the 2 .
One sells less cars the. VW Produced since I started typing in a whole year
The other owns his customers and they pay him to own them ‚Äúprime‚Äù
So not only does Ford Chevy and VW have to produce a 4 door that doe the quarter I. 8.8 second seats 7 drives it‚Äôs self, I‚Äôve trades Tesla shares from the Tesla screen. Oh that‚Äôs just the sedan by the way.  
Or a semi truck that does 60 faster the. Whatever car you have in your drive way .  
Nor do they have to make rockets that land and that can be reused
They don‚Äôt have to bore holes and make underground d tunnels they don‚Äôt need to tweet like a drunk 16 year old and have SEC looking into it
 They need to buy Tesla or 
They have e to make up foe 10 years of infrastructure to support that. 

To bad every car company on earth combined couldn‚Äôt buy Tesla As crazy as that is , it‚Äôs 2021 .  That‚Äôs the world we live in , where valuations mean notbibf and someone who‚Äôs been rifbt once on the most famou short we‚Äôve lived to see says he‚Äôs short Tesla . I say I‚Äôve heard that for 7 years from 100 to 3000 a share and from 300 after split to 800 
I‚Äôve heard that about amazon.
But I also have experienced owning the car and working Witb amazon for almost 10 years
I know one thing
My wealth stems from amazon and Tesla was paid for by Tesla Gains.

And that‚Äôs when I bought the shares again. After the car . 
Or you can watch as that does f150 lightening( I ordered one this morning after seeing  Biden in it, also bought Ford shares 2 days ago and sold some inflated calls today.May be Ford can get to $3000 a shares and split 5 for 1

Oh wait this is 2021 Ford is profitable on every car, sell the shares dumb as company making money and shit 

Here‚Äôs the thing about today
Anything goes .  When nasa gives someone the green. Light , you can pretty much bet your life the way the astronauts do,  and maybe one day those shares can pass GME at the moon and you can see what Mars feels like.

Because these contacts would cost 9.9m to exercise at the strike correct? So he likely has no intention of exercising, but selling the contract ITM for profit?

Ivy league schools focus on that and their students are thuroughly vetted so you'd find a much higher concentration there.

Talking numbers and probabilities, if you threw 100 ivy league grads in one room, 100 state school grads in another, and randomly grabbed 3 from each room, out of the 3 'smartest' people you grabbed, you'd probably wind up having at least 2 of the smartest from the ivy league room.",[],0

9970,gywueld,2021-05-21,t1_gywsgt5,wallstreetbets,"The majority of American options are not actually exercised. I say American because in the Euro market it is different. I‚Äôm telling you this bc the gay nerds who studied this in school, their textbooks like to jerk off this point. So in Europe market you buy an option and you‚Äôre stuck with it until close. In America, land of freedom, you can do whatever the fuck you want, whenever the fuck you want. So if GME moons to 1mil tomorrow, he can take his profit and leave. 

But anyway to answer your point. An option has a writer (seller) and a buyer (this guy.) Anyone can be either. So when times up, the writer has to honor the value of the option, hence why it‚Äôs called an options CONTRACT. Technically the buyer could exercise and then sell in open market blah blah, to save time and a headache, usually if the seller is fucked they just pay the difference in cash. 

Let‚Äôs go a step further. To sell a contract, the normal person should be hedged with shares. I would need 100 shares to sell a contract so that if GME moons then I can keep my premium and the price of my contract is covered by me having the shares to give the other guy. (Covered call.) Hence why this sub exists. Because with options, (although extremely dangerous) you can ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù a shit ton of shares, make a shit ton of money, without having to have started off with a lot (leverage). The autistic thing is that most people end up losing (loss porn.) 

Now for the magic. Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm a big Wall Street asshole. I can make a deal with the broker to sell calls naked (without having the underlying shares) and the broker will front the collateral under a margin loan. Now let‚Äôs say GME moons, Wall Street asshole gets fucked. Bigly. Margin call. Account blown. The GME bull thesis is mostly about shorts covering, not call sellers getting fucked but that‚Äôs good to know too. It‚Äôs called a gamma squeeze. Basically in the event I see my naked calls fucking me in the ass, in order to hedge the position and not blow my account, I would have to buy the shares to hedge myself. So then the stock will squeeze. There are many squeeze possibilities. MOASS (mother of all short squeezes) is still on the table.
