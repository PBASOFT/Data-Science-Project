I don't agree with the ""better hurry up and buy now"" or ""don't try to time the market"" sentiment at all. I mean, timing the market is just what we sometimes do. We have to try, or else we can end up hoping on or off the ride at the worst possible time. I think the point is to not obsess over timing it perfectly.

In my area, people are overbidding and waiving inspections, but realtors are feeding the fire because- newsflash!- they're sales people! When realtors collectively tell buyers that ""it's a sellers market, and you'd better step up your game, and *blah blah blah*,"" they're doing what their brokers have taught them to do.

Brokers know exactly what they're doing when they do this. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because, even if you are a savvy buyer that knows realtors are generally full of shit, the next buyer may not be all that smart. If even one other buyer is a fool, guess what price and overall standard you have to beat now to play ball? A *fool's* price and standard.

**Caveat and disclaimer:** I hate sales people. I hate realtors. And I especially hate brokers. I have a long list of damned good reasons, but still, I am biased. If you want an honest opinion about real estate, get a lawyer, or just do your own research. This is just my opinion.",[],0

I want to empathize though that a lot of it is theory and the only thing we can almost guarantee is that the new level of short sellers (and note, having short sellers is nothing special, that's normal for almost all stocks or...anything) is way higher. The numbers I use try to explain reality, but as it should be obvious I have no insight in when they bought, how much they bought etc. So here is my previous comment:

&#x200B;

It will go exactly the same way it did the last time - the big and leading investor will turn 100k+ into millions and the little retail ones will pay for it. The following is a warning to the people that just blindly follow. You can definitely gamble and win, but at least be reasonable enough what you enter.  
  
The main difference is to have the same effect as it had last time you'd need to reach the same short interest with the same 15 times leverage and not to forget your starting point is now not 10-20$ but 167$.  
  
Let's assume they are stupid enough to actually leverage their short positions still as strong with 15 times (which is insanely unlikely after many got burned, though even more hedgies made a ton of money on it), the positions are this time way smaller (makes sense, you can buy way more positions on 10$ than you can on 167$). Let's keep it simple and just say that the position is now 15 times smaller in amount of shares, but same in value (it would be 16.7 times, but as I said, simple).  
  
We will also assume the main short positions were previously at 20$, which is really generous considering the year started at 17$ and it went down to \~7$ in it's history. To understand why this is really important you have to take about margin requirements, interest and leverage, but again I'll keep it simple because all of these things would make it worse for the retail investor to cause a second squeeze. If you didn't realize it already, everything I put together so far is put into high favor of the retail investor, meaning if the following sounds unlikely or even impossible to happen, then just imagine how unlikely it actually is without a favor.  
  
The main squeeze happened previously assumed at 350$ and 150$, at both cases a massive volume went into GME while buying was restricted on most retail brokers. In the first case it reached 500$, in the second case it reached back to 350$. The 150 to 350 jump was by far more significant and most likely the majority of the squeeze. That means the squeeze was achieved with a difference of 150-20=130$. To achieve the same effect on 167$ starting position you would need to reach 297$. This sounds very achievable, doesn't it? Except that the 297$ assumes the same amount is shorted than it was on 20$, which obviously isn't the case. While the same amount of money could have went in, the positions are way less, meaning the losses are way less. So let's go back to get 15 times smaller positions I mentioned before. Just in case someone can't follow:  
  
If you short Gamestop for 1000$ at a share price of 20$, you have 50 open positions. If the price now goes to 40$, then your positions are at -20$, per position. That means you are down 1000$ as a hedge fund. Now we amplify this by the 15 leverage that was reported on these positions and those 50 positions are now a loss of -15,000$. Sounds small but don't forget I only used 50 open positions (as in, 50 shorted shares), while reality was way beyond millions. What you should actually look at that their position of 1000$ now lost them 15,000$, and that while the share price was only at 40$. For 150$ that's a loss of 130$ per share, or 50x130=6500, times 15 for the leverage, is 97,500$ in losses. On only 50 shorted shares. And not to forget, these have interest to a certain extend (usually big accounts pay way less interest or even no interest if they don't require margin to hold up the position).  
  
Now that we talked about what happened we have to talk about what needs to happen here for the same effect. We will use the same example to make it clear for everyone, but instead of using 20$ as a share price it's now 167$ and the same 1000$ used. When you open a short position now worth 1000$ in total, that's only 6 open positions. That's it. Not like the 50 before. While the same money is used, it costs now way more. But if the same money is used, does this matter? Let's play it through. In the first example above this we went from 20$ to 40$, so let's go up 20$ now. We reach 187$, a loss of 20$ per share. 6x20=120, 15 times leverage = 1,800$. That's it. Before we had a loss of -15,000$, now it would only be a loss of 1,800$. That means to reach the same level we had before, you have to adjust for the difference in amount, so let's do that. We can't force them to buy more, so all you can do is aim for a higher stock price that the loss for the 1000$ investment in both examples is the same. Oh and of course that's not for the case of a 20$ difference, at 40$ nothing happened. What we care about is the 150$ (which is again in favor of the investor the lowest point possible to compare with, a real point would rather be 300-350$ which would make it way more impossible to achieve).  
  
If you couldn't follow, our goal is to calculate what cost the share price has to reach that the 6 positions at 167$ have an impact as strong as the 50 positions at 20$. This on it's own means nothing, but once you get to that territory there is a high chance history repeats, unless they learned and improved their strategy.  
  
Let's add together what we know:  
  
\-We need to reach a price of 297$ to be in the same price difference as previously  
  
\-Since way less shares were shorted now, we have to make up to reach the same loss by increasing the share price, since we can't force them to use more capital to open more positions  
  
We take the 6500$ in losses we had in the first example pre-leverage (since we care about the stock price) and now divide it by 6, the new amount of positions we were able to open at a price of 167. That comes down to 1083.33$ you have to reach as a LOSS, not share price. For the share price we have to add the 167 cost on top since that's the starting point, so 1250$.  
  
If you didn't follow this, here is the TL&DR explanation: For a hedge fund to see the same amount of losses, assuming the position size is the same but quantity is less due to way higher price, the stock GME would need to reach a price of 1250$.  
  
There are many factors that have to be considered here:  
  
1: While there is a world that exactly the same mistakes were done, it's very unlikely  
  
2: They already played dirty the last time, if it would get to the point again that will repeat but way worse, probably also with way less media coverage because they learned their lessons to get better at playing their own game  
  
3: The 1250$ is a real low role. The main reason for that is that the assumption is the same investment, but after some hedge funds got burned badly there is a high chance new short positions are way smaller. My entire example was with the same amount of money used, but that's very unlikely.  
  
4: The main reason the squeeze was so succesfull was the 15 times leverage used, amplifying everything by a shit ton. Yet again I would be highly surprised if they did the same amount again. Even just a reduction from 15 times to 10 times means you have to reach a 33% higher share price, which is a ton considering my for the retail investor highly favored calculation is already at 1250$.  
  
5: Since this is a repeat and not a new thing, strategies were most likely adjusted. There is a high chance that shorting is followed by buying, meaning this can easily turn into a win-win for them. They can sell high after a certain subreddit hypes it up like crazy, and then sell at a small lose when it comes back down again. Just as a reminder, the last time it went down to it's 30s.

Price per earnings. You divide companys valuation with it's earnings(or alternately you divide share price with earning per share, that's the same result)

What you get is how much the market is willing to pay for the company's current earnings. 
For example company like Tesla has very high P/E. Market expects the earnings to increase in the future to justify high price or the stock is just overvalued.
If a company has very low P/E, you get high current earnings for a cheap price. The market clearly expects the earnings to dwindle. The stock is a good deal IF the market is wrong.

P/E can also be used to compare market with the past. If the average P/E of sp500 is much higher than usually you can say that the market is willing to pay more for smaller earnings. This could indicate a bubble or strange market conditions.",['TSLA'],0

204,gzn7giz,2021-05-27,t1_gzmprf9,StockMarket,"Just wrote a long reply then my phone died, unfortunately I don’t have a lot of time, but I’ll try and re-write a couple salient points:

Late 70s-early 80s: real world inflation reaches beyond 14%
      Real world: Iran has a revolution and their oil production falls off the map
   Markets: crude oil prices double
      Real world correlation: long lines at the gas pump 
   Tell: Oil is a leading indicator for inflation 

This is not the 70s/80s Pull up a historic chart of treasures yields, and you will see the 70s-80s at the top left right now  it is down at the bottom right, excluding last year we are at an all time low. The rate of inflation increasing could be considered drastic this year, but actual inflation is not. In fact it would be way more concerning if inflation didn’t pick up, because it would mean the real world economy isn’t advancing.

I can point out real world deflation to you in more readily in your lifetime much easier than inflation: How much tile do you spend online? How much does it cost you? What are your expectations when paying for things such as entertainment?  All these things are a net deflationary force. Not only does it make things cheaper due to greater efficiency,  it also creates and delivers on the expectation of services and even things like entertainment for cheap/free. In other words the ubiquitous use of tech is a net deflationary force and it is something you can readily see all around you. 

So it’s all relative we can see signs of inflation in many areas now: try ordering a new tv, a new car, look at gas prices—the first two are supply chain issues, to a certain degree the second one is too and, but is still inline with historic trends. I guess the point is for all the inflation we see, it pales compared to what your dad experienced. It is nowhere close. Not by miles. As far as the fed goes they are not just doing equations, looking at charts, they are watching the real world—in fact that’s their focus—getting unemployment numbers down.  

I probably didn’t answer your question, but hopefully it was helpful in some way...",[],0

Look at it this way - if the minimum is set to 10% and the US has 15% at the moment and Ireland has 2%, just as an example - totally made up numbers.

Ireland would bring its tax rate to 10% as would everyone else who is currently under. They’d still be the cheapest. While going from 2 to 10 percent is bad, going to 15 would still be worse. And the states wouldn’t go down to 10 because they’d lose a mountain of money.

You could argue that the convenience of doing business in the states would outweigh the now much smaller difference - but the states would also know that and probably raise corporate taxes - because they can. The dynamic would be restored quickly enough in my opinion, and the result would be a net transfer of wealth from multinational companies to sovereign nations who can then redistribute that money to narrow the wealth divide.",[],0

The underlying problem is the tax laws currently are outdated and rely on various forms of physical presence tests to determine residency, which is where a company pays tax. A company in Ireland, owned by US interests, that sells exclusively to the US, can in certain circumstances be taxed almost exclusively in Ireland, purely because they have lower tax rates, while the US economy and consumers in this example are the ones paying for this company’s profits. There are very good arguments to say that this is inappropriate and that profits from US customers, in this example, should be subject to US tax rules and the US should get their fair share, and this is the way the global economy is going (see OECD initiatives and BEPS).

Ultimately what will happen is if these other small countries don’t fall in line is that the major players (US, EU, etc.) will simply say if you sold to a customer in our country, you have to pay our taxes on that sale anyway, which can result in double tax and these companies would then leave those smaller “tax havens” as they would no longer serve a purpose.",[],0

The goal is to push the price low enough to trigger other people's stop losses (a stop loss is an automatic order you can set, it will automatically sell your shares at a price that you select). So the whales sell their shares, flooding the market, the price drops so low it starts hitting other people's stop losses which further amplifies selling pressure, the unknowing ppl freak out and dump their shares....

Then the whales come back and buy all their shares back at a much cheaper price, and theyve washed out tons of small fish...

Thats a stop loss raid, and that is manipulating the stock price. Naked shorting has a similar goal, different method, but im not talking about that.

What im saying is, price manipulation isnt just gamestop. When you hear these ""conspiracy theories"" you think gamestop, right? Because gamestop is the 1 time that these dirty tricks EVER got so much attention. This stuff isnt new, retail investors have just been working around it for a long time. You see the wave that big money makes, ride it, get out.

But suddenly wall street bets brought literally millions of rambunctious retail investors who hoot and holler, and now this dirty playing is getting exposed on a level never before seen. It isnt all about gamestop, screw gamestop. This is about the entire game.",[],0

I guess my problem is that I agree with the general thesis (regulatory capture happens, and it's bad; hedge funds are allowed to get away with too much, including naked short selling), but I'm not seeing how it connects to the whole ""market is gonna crash economic collapse hedge funds liquidate *everything* to cover their shorts my floor is $10 million per share"" rigamarole. 

I think the first part is legit but when it starts bleeding over into this ""pending economic collapse"" bullshit it starts blaring out those Qanon alarm bells. 

Every once in a while I go on over there to one of the Qanon websites. You'd be surprised at how many folks there are infiltrating SuperStonk and GME and WSB subs, and piggybacking onto this distrust of financial systems with their own beliefs about pending civil war or economic collapse. It's disturbing, tbh.

413,gzntszh,2021-05-27,t1_gznqzxv,StockMarket,"Absolutely, discussion is great. 

I mean there are a lot of factors pointing towards a crash or large ""correction"" no? Reverse repo rates, negative sp500 return inflation adjusted, bond rates, inflation rates, etc. A lot of those happened everytime there has been a crash no?

Additonally, as for the 10m floor. Technically they aren't wrong if the short interest theorized is correct. If the hedge funds have truly naked shorts sold hundreds and hundreds of the percent of floating shares than the price could and I emphasize could be limitless. If the price of gme and AMC continue to increase at this rate while other securities start to lower in price then this leads to a better chance of a margin call due to lack of collateral. 

Hypothetically speaking, let's say June 9th comes for the gme annual shareholder event and Ryan Cohen decides to announce the amount of votes and let's say there should be 30 million but he announces that there were 150 million then obviously a short squeeze is imminent. And that situation the float has been shorted five times over. At that point anyone who has been on the fence about buying the stock would immediately jump in because the squeeze would have to happen. Volkswagen squeezed five to six times on a 12% short interest so there would be no reason not to buy in if that short interest on GameStop is correct based on the research. If, and I mean if, that happens then the price would be a you name it type of situation. The shorts would have to cover every naked short they have created, that is extreme buying pressure and if over 30 million shares refuse to sell then the buying pressure never ends because they have to cover and because more than the float existing refuses to sell they never fully cover. That's just supply and demand. 

Is the short interest that high? No clue only Time Will tell. If it is that hot will the price really skyrocket to thousands hundreds of thousands or millions? No idea it'll only go as high as the mass amount of votes decided will and continue to hold. Personally, I do intend to sell on the way down. Whether that is the way down from 5,000 10,000 50,000 100,000 10 million who knows but I won't sell early and cut myself short I would rather sell on the way down and whatever games I achieve that will be that.

Basically, the paper seems like a long, drawn out, bull case for gamestop.... and is being said that it's about the overall market.

Now, what happens when something comes along to stabilize the cryptos. Makes bitcoin stick between 50k and 52k for the next 10 years? If you knew that it has an extremely unlikely chance to go up above 5% in a 10 year span, would you invest anything into it?

The proposed budget increases spending by $2.5 T. His proposed tax increase I previously read about was to increase corporate tax rates from 21% to 28%. If this happens, it will in no way help pay for the increase in spending. 

Billionaires in the U.S. have a combined wealth of $4 T. This is wealth, so assets, like properties, stocks, etc. This is not yearly income. I have no clue how any increase in taxes will offset this.

If you buy and sell, that is simply buying and selling, it doesn't matter if you buy later at a lower price, you already made a profit. Average is when you keep your shares and buy more at a lower price. You buy a share at $10, hoping it would be higher to take a profit, but it go down to $5, you are losing $5 and have to wait for it to pass the $10 to get a profit. Now, you buy one more at $5 and you have 2 shares and you averaged them to $7.50, so, if your stock pass the $7.50 mark you will get a profit. One share at $10 + one share at $5 = $15 divided 2 = $7.50. This is calling ""average"". I do it many times in order to lower the price of my shares if them go down a lot. Good luck!",[],0

Also, there are a lot of additional variables that HFs and financial institutions have never dealt with. Its the mania, people communicating and grouping up at break neck speeds, people digging deep into the situation why this or that is happening, how the short interest can exceed the entire float of the stock, why there were so many brokers who blocked meme stock buying back in January.

This is a completely new paradigm that not even HF experts can deal with 100%. If you can find a person who can understand all of stock market dynamics that are happening behind the scenes **AND** who understand how regular joe is thinking in these unprecedented times, with all the lockdowns and struggles at regular jobs - you will very likely become a millionaire.

IMO such one person does not exist, these are two completely different worlds. And the only thing HFs can do is to presumably find someone who ""understands"" reddit and people, and take his opinion as gospel. Which as complete gamble at this point.",['GME'],0

People decide cash nor bonds are no longer safe assets as they deflate or lose power of purchase. People still need basic necessities to survive so you see food commodities rise among commodities that have direct correlation to the economy (precious metals, oil and gas, lumber, etc.).

When you see stocks making unusually high increases obviously it can mean things are just warming up and greater increase is on the way or simply because these high points have never before been reached so people see a small decline and jump ship which leads to more of a decline and soon a large one due to fear of lost profits. Well think about it this way in this new age the stock market has been reaching record highs due to the new comers gaining interest in stocks, and following “trends” so if you see something that’s got social media coverage and it starts to climb than hop on for the ride and hold on tight because these things tend to take off and reach greater heights many times past its previous peek. So you can sell now but if it reaches even greater peeks you’ll be kicking your own behind wishing you stayed on longer. But I’m not a financial advisor so I don’t kno shii",[],1
