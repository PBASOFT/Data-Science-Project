New rules will affect your ability to buy and sell âPink No Informationâ securities, including at E*TRADE 

On September 28, 2021, new requirements take effect that will impact the market forâand value ofâcertain âover-the-counter (OTC) securitiesâ you currently hold or have held in the past. The new rules apply to âPink No Informationâ OTC securities of companies that fail to publicly report and keep current financial and other company information and will restrict the ability of U.S. brokers, like E*TRADE from making these products generally available. 

Some background on the new requirements 

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently adopted amendments to SEC Rule 15c2-11 governing the submission and publication of OTC quotations. These amendments will prohibit broker-dealers from submitting or publicly disseminating bid/ask quotations for OTC securities of issuers that do not meet enhanced information filing requirements. 

Securities of issuers that make the required information publicly available by the deadline in the rule should not be affected. 

What these changes mean for you 

Starting September 28, 2021, you will no longer be able to buy or sell âPink No Informationâ OTC securities through E*TRADE. Other restrictions related to the purchase of these securities may apply sooner. Please keep in mind that the upcoming changes will negatively affect the value of any âPink No Informationâ OTC securities you hold now or in the future. 

Hereâs how to get more information about these changes and how they might affect you:

83,2021-05-19,pennystocks," I wanted to do an update on the recent catalysts met for **$PBT** from an original post of [Due Diligence here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/n2ktvd/pbt_energy_play_extensive_dd_on_lagging_post/)

Since [Cathie Wood has decided recently to weigh in on oil prices.](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3694761-arks-cathie-wood-weighs-in-on-oil-sees-70-ceiling) I have a history of betting against Cathie, feel free to search my post history, as I called the top of ARKK with some extensive DD and made a nice profit from that analysis. WSB called me crazy while my puts printed huge. As we all know inflation is here to stay and commodities will be a strong long term play. 

https://preview.redd.it/4odrp2ouazz61.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=605501f1a10e27a40c45e0b238fe282b54876e71

  

**My Price Target** for the month of June based on the above reasoning is **$17** and a continued upside of **$17-21** through August without any sort of volume manipulation or option squeeze.

I'm targeting a **300-400% increase** in the underlying stock price by August if Oil prices remain where they are or near $70.

**Current Position**

In all transparency this is less than 10% of my overall account. 2020 was really good to me on investing in value plays and shorting some of the biggest bubbles in March(see my ARKK post). However I believe that if your going to give advice you have to have some skin in the [game to give clear advice](https://discord.com/channels/506998257247846423/506998257789173772/844388063820251177)

Since my last post **$PBT** is up 10.9% without any of the major catalysts being met as they roll in the next few months. It's better to be early before the big moves and that's what I'm outlining below.

My current position is heavy at

200 Sept 17 C5

175 Sept 17 C7.5

90,204 shares

I have based some of my findings for my PT on a related royalty trust TPL that has had a run recently due to large oil production output but lower overall oil pricing during its run. TPL went from $480-1710(2.5x) in the past 5 months off the same principles outlined for **$PBT**, except **$PBT** lagging in production coming online with higher oil prices leads me to believe a larger upside is possible. Other royalty trusts I ran through my models include MVO, SJT, and SBR with **$PBT** being by far the most to gain on the upside of the underlying stock price and possibly the most pure penny stock oil play.

**Increase In Dividend**

For the month of May PBT has increased its dividend month on month by 17% to $0.021243 per unit. 

https://preview.redd.it/9dnzhq2wbzz61.png?width=737&format=png&auto=webp&s=14bf0cb8a90a11a25b9dc3390be1902d3d8203d7

It's important to note that **$PBT** current dividend is still below pre Pandemic levels that dropped in March due to low Oil demand. Current demand for oil is increasing quickly with the reopening and **$PBT** has a monthly dividend which allows for a continued catalyst through the next 3-4 months.

Average dividend payout is show below based on oil prices per year

https://preview.redd.it/i8hbrjlybzz61.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=5736a9a766dee64efbb2628d30b9f7b8628ba6e1

 

**FORM 10-Q Released on May 17(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000319654/000119312521163404/d492204d10q.htm)**

>For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, royalty income received by the Trust amounted to $2,124,157 compared to royalty income of $6,254,509 during the first quarter of 2020. The decrease in royalty income is primarily attributable to increased drilling costs on the Waddell Ranch properties resulting in a deficiency for the NPI, therefore, no royalties were paid, despite an increase in oil production and an increase in the price of gas for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2020.  
>  
>Royalty income for the Trust for the first quarter of the calendar year is associated with actual oil and gas production for the period of **November and December 2020 and January 2021** from the properties from which the Trust’s net overriding royalty interests (“Royalties”) were carved.

Current income is based on a lagging price of oil for the months currently ending in January. Oil Prices for the 3 months of the 10-Q averaged $44.08 per Bbl compared to the current price of $64.90 at today's closing.

A higher amount of drilling coupled with the lower oil prices prior to Feb spike has kept the dividend to a lower calculation. The 10-Q shows that production costs associated with the operator on record are bringing new wells online at a time when oil prices are skyrocketing.

>Capital expenditures for drilling, remedial and maintenance activities on the Waddell Ranch properties during the first quarter of 2021 totaled $9.5 million as compared to $528,000 for the first quarter of 2020. Blackbeard has previously informed the Trustee that the 2021 capital expenditures budget has been approved at $88.6 million (gross) ($32.5 million net to the Trust) for the Waddell Ranch properties. The total amount of capital expenditures for 2020 with regard to the Waddell Ranch properties totaled $10.4 million (gross).   
>  
>The Trustee has been advised that there were 27 workover wells completed, 8 new wells completed, 8 new wells in progress and 9 workover wells in progress during the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to no workover wells completed, no new wells completed, no new wells in progress and no workover wells in progress for the three months ended March 31, 2020, on the Waddell Ranch properties. There were various facility projects in progress for the first quarter of 2021.

The production value being added to **$PBT** is at the highest it has been in almost a decade. Above shows the large portion of capex is being used through the month on Jan 2021 based on the 10-Q and current unknown expenditures for the past 2 months are calculated on the oil trust dividend payments.

**$PBT** has been lagging behind other royalty trusts in the market due to a production holds on Oil Prices that could allow for it's dividend payment to grow exponentially. 

**WTI Crude Oil Price outlook**

Oil prices have been on a run in early 2021 up until recently with new COVID scares slowing the explosive price action. However, most economies are still opening up faster than ever and vaccinations and summer months should help ease some of these worries. A recent article has Goldman predicting Oil will reach $80 in the near future

US imports plunge to lowest levels since 1973 from OPEC

[https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/US-Oil-Imports-From-OPEC-Plunge-To-Lowest-Since-1973.amp.html](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/US-Oil-Imports-From-OPEC-Plunge-To-Lowest-Since-1973.amp.html)

Royalty Trusts are the few true Oil plays related directly to Oil price and production since they carry little to no debt. Historically **$PBT** stock price large increases in a short period are due to a spike in dividend that is related to the sale of Crude Oil on the market price. Since the price to produce the oil doesn't vary much, a higher price over a certain threshold always produces a much larger dividend.

**PBT Production Outlook**

Based on my analysis, I believe **$PBT** has a production windfall coming into a supply squeeze in the coming months that will lead to an extremely large jump in dividend payouts and a large price increase if played correctly by investors. **$PBT** has one of the largest land holdings for a royalty trust at 78,715 gross (34,205 net) producing acres, roughly calculated based on recent lease acquisitions to a total value of $3.14B while trading on a market cap of $175M due to low dividend payout since COVID shutdowns and low production output. 

Royalty income received by the Trustee for the year ended December 31, 2008, was $112,341,696 compared  to $12,585,688 in 2020. Since the formula to calculate the dividend still depends on the operators expenses and the operator has a large  planned expenditures budget of $37.7M to bring on more production that  has been decreasing since 2010; I'm assuming the outlook for production  will be very high for these leases +1.2M barrels of crude and +4M mcf of  Natural Gas which is more average for years 2008-2010 as opposed to  2019(pre COVID) output of 831k/3.5M.

Though there seems to be a large capex budget for 2021 at $86.7M, we have already seen 3 months of these expenses adjusted into the dividend payout. US shale are tight plays with short lifespan on wells, so if the  operator and trust aren't drilling and completing wells then production  can fall off quickly within 6 months. The costs associated with the new  wells and the 10 already complete since last year should increase production while leveraging potentially very high oil and gas prices  near term. As opposed to a small Oil company looking to leverage their  services in the sector for possibly only a short term with rising oil  prices.

**Land Leases**

Expanding on the production costs already assumed by the new operator costs for **$PBT** as of April 2020 and the new supply/demand coming online since COVID is decreasing. I wanted to share the EIA visual data I found for the past decade that shows oil output for the region that most of **$PBT** has their leases on.

**TLDR:** $PBT is currently a low volume mid cap pure mineral rights Oil play that isn't prone to bankruptcy. It has lagged the Oil market due to production output and Oil pricing leaving their dividend to be low. Current finished projects from 2020 when oil prices were suppressed should make the dividend pop and lead to a huge increase in volume that historically pushes the stock price up dramatically short term. With a fairly cheap options chain available for a larger than anticipated move over the next couple months could print major.",nfsxep,[],0

Disclaimer: I do own stock in this company.

My Take:

**Westbond Enterprises Corp** has a huge yield of **10.26%.** They made a lot gains over covid with fat government contracts but I believe as they are adding new high margin products to their product line it will continue to grow with good financials. As Covid has made many people become more aware of cleaning and sanitizing I don't think this trend will leave us that soon. There products are also used in hospitals and nursing homes which have all increased there use as sanitizing regulations have been increased. All in all they are a small established company that is making money and I think they will be making more into the future weather Covid is gone this summer or not.

The Knighthead-Certares plan would give equity holders a recovery of about $8 a share -- a package that’s made up of about $240 million in cash and warrants for nearly 20% of the reorganized company, the people said.
> 
> Hertz shares -- which up until two months ago were faced with the prospects of being completely wiped out under an earlier plan -- soared as much as 41% Wednesday to as high as $5.19. That approached a high of $6.25 last June, when traders snapping up penny stocks on the popular Robinhood app sought to defy decades of convention and make money on a bankrupt company.

> 
> Investment firms have been dueling over ownership of Hertz for weeks, with both groups seeking to top the other with multiple rounds of proposals. An earlier Knighthead proposal valued Hertz’s equity at around $2.25 a share, with an enterprise value of $6.2 billion, Bloomberg previously reported.

# A. Preamble

$ONCT is one of the most underslept stocks in the biotech yet alone larger investing community, no question. Considering its solid clinical results and upcoming catalysts (literally in a few weeks), I don't see why it isn't getting the recognition it deserves.

ONCT is an early stage biotech specializing in targeting ROR1 expressing cancers. While cancer has always been a hot topic in this industry, ONCT is one of the *few* companies addressing it through the lens of ROR1. I'll explain more about ROR1 below but this isn't your run of the mill gene, protein, or whatever that other pharma companies are focusing on. VelosBio, another company focused on ROR1 cancers was acquired by Merck in 2020 for $2.8B ([https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/merck-inks-2-8b-velosbio-buyout-to-snag-anti-ror1-adc](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/merck-inks-2-8b-velosbio-buyout-to-snag-anti-ror1-adc)). The same for NBE-Therapeutics for $1.5B in 2020 by Boehringer Ingelheim ([https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/boehringer-inks-1-5b-nbe-buyout-joining-merck-ror1-adc-race](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/boehringer-inks-1-5b-nbe-buyout-joining-merck-ror1-adc-race)) . Looks like huge players in pharma are interested in ROR1 for some reason, and lucky for us, ONCT does *exactly* that.

# B. Cirmtuzumab for MCL and CLL (Blood Cancer)

https://preview.redd.it/jrh5iqzd67071.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=cad45ccd1668a57f107eaf0aeaf6c00bc786acda

A lot of things destroy cancer but those same things can also destroy our own healthy cells. **Cirmutzumab** is a potential first in class monoclonal antibody developed by ONCT and targets the ROR1 protein on the surface of cancer cells. ROR1 activity is associated with very **aggressive** symptoms ranging from metastasis to treatment resistance. Lucky for us, ROR1 is *highly* specific to a wide range of different cancers as seen in the figure below and is the very thing cirmtuzumab targets.

**Figure 1**. ROR1 Expression Across Different Tumors

https://preview.redd.it/v441lbhf67071.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa6e88427942443aea09ac3e48d5faf1e073de34

As seen in Figure 1, indications of interest are Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), both of which express ROR1 at extremely high levels. These are B-cell malignancies or hematologic cancers. Alright enough with the fluffy intros, **what does the data say?**

**Figure 2.** CIRLL Phase ½ Trial Data for MCL and CLL

https://preview.redd.it/ow3vwqhg67071.png?width=1514&format=png&auto=webp&s=665da36941ac844fa3247b756381ade612d94fb1

In a treatment design combining cirmtuzumab with ibrutinib, another treatment for hematologic malignancies, the **objective response rate** for MCL was **87%** and **92%** for CLL (Figure 2). So why was cirmtu incorporated with ibrutinib to begin with? Unfortunately, a large number of older patients develop resistance to ibrutinib and hematological disease like MCL can be extremely aggressive with a low 5-year survival rate ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7281539/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7281539/)). The combination not only exceeded the efficacy of standalone ibrutinib therapy for MCL with a historical ORR of around 65% but also did so in high-risk populations that were **heavily pre-treated with other therapies**. The data is non-negotiable (Figure 3).

**Figure 3**. Overview of Results in Sub-Populations. CR stands for complete response while PR stands for partial response.

https://preview.redd.it/6duwxg9h67071.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=f28331fe2273759d751b460cb710b582f0855c0b

Like I said before, a lot of things can attack cancer albeit at the expense of our own cells. Safety is all the more important for cancer and older patients with potentially compromised immune function. There were **0 discontinuations or dose limiting toxicities from cirmtuzumab**. So we potentially have a promising new therapy that targets a range of cancers effectively while minimizing treatment side-effects. Sounds like a solid win to me.

As a side note, ONCT recently expanded their indications to other cancers such as breast cancer. In a trial conducted in UC San Diego, patients with HER2 negative metastatic or locally advanced unresectable breast cancer were treated with cirmtuzumab + paclitaxel. This is an **extremely aggressive form of breast cancer** with patients receiving a **median of 6 prior therapies**. The study reported an objective response rate of around 57% which beats the historical rate at around 30% for this subgroup of patients. I will admit, the share price took a hit after this announcement. I venture to say this was a combination of people selling the news and people feeling discouraged with the seemingly low response rate of 57% without realizing that these patients were being treated for **aggressive and treatment resistance breast cancer**.

ONCT is also in dialogue with the **FDA for a potential accelerated approval study for MCL.** Now, clinical trials can last years so will we have patent protection once this therapy is approved? Yup, **patent protection extending all the way to 2033**.

# C. TK216 for Ewing Sarcoma

https://preview.redd.it/pxd7rhai67071.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fa1075705c3a7ab94fac97e2dfc3ca4cfae0105

To pivot, ONCT is also developing a treatment called **TK216** for Ewing Sarcoma. Ewing sarcoma is a very rare pediatric cancer and the 2nd most common pediatric bone cancer. The current standard of care is absolutely abysmal and is based on chemotherapy and invasive surgical procedures. I seriously can't stress how pitiful current treatments are for this disease.

TK216 targets a family of proteins called ETS factors that are directly implicated in Ewing sarcoma and other cancers. So what does the data say about TK216? Well, in a phase ½ trial conducted on patients with relapsed Ewing sarcoma and who received on average **4 prior therapies**, TK216 accomplished a **9% complete response rate** and **43% disease control rate**. Looks crappy right? Until you dig around and look at the response rates of approved therapies for this disease, you won't realize how **phenomenal** these results are. The FDA seems to agree and has assigned TK216 with an **orphan drug designation for Ewing Sarcoma**.

**Figure 4**. TK216 Clinical Response Rate in Relapsed or Refractory Ewing Sarcoma

https://preview.redd.it/ibaa2klj67071.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=52b0601afed2f424f774e83ce15c5bb52e834186

# D. *** Upcoming Catalysts

Here's a brief overview on the expected milestones and timeline

https://preview.redd.it/946b3zik67071.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=f353cf54506b071c6bb20e24598f58d298312d44

**Most importantly** **and the reason why I'm writing this post right now**, ONCT will be presenting its most updated results for cirmtuzumab on MCL and CLL patients and TK216 on Ewing sarcoma in the **2021 ASCO Conference on June 4th and 7th**. This is **highly anticipated data** in what is the world's leading cancer conference, and I expect a huge run up to the conference. Just for reference, ONCT experienced a 78.1% surge in price after releasing an update on its phase ½ trial for cirmtuzumab back in November of 2020. Moreover, the embargoed abstracts for these results were released **today**.

# E. May 19th Data Updates

On May 19th, ONCT released its embargoed abstracts containing the most recent updates concerning cirmtuzumab and TK216. I'd encourage you to look into the updated data yourself:

1. Cirmtuzumab ([https://investor.oncternal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oncternal-therapeutics-presents-updated-interim-data-cirmtuzumab](https://investor.oncternal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oncternal-therapeutics-presents-updated-interim-data-cirmtuzumab)).
2. TK216 ([https://investor.oncternal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oncternal-therapeutics-presents-updated-interim-data-tk216](https://investor.oncternal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oncternal-therapeutics-presents-updated-interim-data-tk216)).

While the details of each trial will be discussed at the conference, I want to mention some key results.

**Cirmtuzumab for MCL May 19th Update**:

1. Objective response rate of **83%** in **heavily pre-treated patients with MCL, beating the historical ORR of 66%.**
2. Complete response rate of **39% for MCL, beating the historical CR rate of 20%.**
3. Median progression-free survival and overall survival **not reached.**
4. **Excellent safety profile** with slight improvements compared to historical treatment with ibrutinib.

**Cirmtuzumab for CLL May 19th Update:**

1. Objective response rate of **94%** in **heavily pre-treated patients with CLL.**
2. Median progression-free survival and overall survival **not reached.**
3. **Excellent safety profile** with slight improvements compared to historical treatment with ibrutinib.

**TK216 for Ewing Sarcoma May 19th Update:**

1. **2 patients with complete response** with a follow up of over 1 year each.
2. Stable disease reached for **35.5%** of patients.
3. Updated safety profile showing that TK216 was well-tolerated with no unexpected off-target toxicities or deaths.
4. Patients had **metastases at study entry and heavily pre-treated with a median # of 3 prior systemic therapies**

I wanted to spend more time writing a thorough DD highlighting additional factors such as the management team, details on market potential, expansion into CAR-T therapy, etc. but I wanted to at least post something up before the expected run up to the ASCO conference. If you are interested, I will be happy to write a part II and follow up to this post.

TLDR

1. Promising data on hematological cancers and Ewing sarcoma to be released in **June 4th and 7th,** making this a possible short-term play. Historically, large surges in price with each data release.
2. Embargoed abstracts for #1 released today with excellent data.",ngpzbi,[],0

3. Person A’s following KNOWS based on history that because Person A has a large following, whatever stock Person A calls out will immediately see a jump in price.
4. Person A notices the opportunity here and takes full advantage, buying massive blocks of shares right before they callout the stock to their following.
5. Person A calls out XYZ stock.
6. Person A’s following buys XYZ stock.
7. XYZ’s stock price jumps 10%.

9. Person A is now out of XYZ stock, making a clean exit.

10. The price of stock XYZ will now either A) continue to go up, B) stall out, or C) trigger a halt to the downside-- with C) happening more often than A) or B).

11. The price of XYZ stock is now marginally above, at, or below the price it started at prior to Person A's callout.

12. Person A makes another callout on CCC stock.

13. Person A’s following notices this and is left with three options: A) baghold XYZ stock, B) wait to see if Person A loops back to XYZ stock, anticipating Person A will continue to support XYZ stock, or C) cut their loss, regardless of how big or small, and hope to make money on Person A’s next callout on CCC stock.

14. Person A gets hailed as being a great trader.

15. On the other side of Fintwits, Person A also gets called out for frontloading pumps. Person A responds to these claims stating he isn't P&Ding because they aren't forcing anyone to follow their trades.

* ""Trade at your own risk. Those who lost money deserved to lose because they picked a bad entry.""
* ""Person A isn't misinforming their following on XYZ stock, and therefore, can't intentionally mislead them which is the basis of a pump and dump.""
* ""Person A forms a symbiotic relationship. We make money with Person A. Person A wouldn't dump on us.""

**The most common responses I get from those who believe it's** \*\*\*Person A'\*\*\***s fault normally follow the logic of:**

* ""Person A knows what they're doing. They know they can make the price of XYZ stock jump 10% when they make the callout. Because Person A knows this and take advantage of this by frontloading, Person A is, therefore, pumping the stock for their own gain.""
* ""Person A causes more harm than good. When they make their callout, Person A is creating thousands of panic buyers where many will soon become panic sellers.

I honestly couldn’t find a lot of the science behind Zofin on Organicell’s website. But that’s okay. Their main achievement is basically a proprietary way of isolating certain stem cell excretions. 

Here is some science that shows how those types of products could be valuable.

I’d recommend reading the full article for anyone with a scientific background or an interest in biochemistry.

Here are the points I think are relevant to Organicell and COVID.

[these brackets are my additions and interpretations, basically a less scientific wording forgive me if I got anything wrong]


-The use of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as cell free therapy is a promising approach to stimulate tissue regeneration including that of the nervous system.

-The immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects of mesenchymal stem cells-derived EVs have been well studied, knowledge of this paracrine mechanism and the availability of these cells, positions mesenchymal stem cells as a potential source of EVs for cell free therapy for a variety of regenerative and nervous system disorders.

[they help modulate the immune system which basically means keep it balanced and working]

-Confirmation of the paracrine effects of stem cells and the relevance to tissue regeneration was a breakthrough in this area, paving the way for a series of subsequent studies to characterize and leverage this mechanism for therapeutic development.

[Paracrine signaling is a form of cell signaling, a type of cellular communication in which a cell produces a signal to induce changes in nearby cells, altering the behaviour of those cells. (Wikipedia) - that means that the chemical signals from the harvested cells will be in Zofin and affect positive changes to the patients cells]

-Gnecchi et al. were the first to show that conditioned medium from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) overexpressing the gene Akt1 exerted cytoprotective effects on cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia in vitro, reduced acute myocardial infarction sizes and improved ventricular functions in vivo

[technology similar to Zofin was proven to protect heart tissue which was starved of oxygen in a living model, and improved heart chamber function as well] 

-MSCs-derived conditional medium was reported to stimulate functional and morphological improvement in pathological conditions such as renal injury, myocardial infarction, and fulminant hepatic failure 

[technology similar to Zofin was proven to improve sick kidneys, help heart attack recovery and reverse liver failure]

-...It was subsequently established that these beneficial [effects] were attributable to soluble factors including extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from stem cells (Bruno et al., 2009; Lai et al., 2010; Xin et al., 2013a). The biogenesis and methodology of isolation of EVs has been described in several published reviews (Biancone et al., 2012; Akers et al., 2013; Koniusz et al., 2016).

[the beneficial effects were attributed to essentially “stuff the stem cells excreted” as opposed to the stem cells themselves, which is also what’s in Zofin]

-The anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of MSC-derived EVs and their paracrine mechanism of action have been well studied (Kalani et al., 2014; Börger et al., 2017).

[the chemical signals the stem cells send to other cells is the reason the cellular therapy worked to prevent inflammation and protect brain function. Those chemical messengers are in Zofin]

-EVs have been shown to be actively involved in processes of immune regulation such as stimulation of T-cell proliferation, apoptosis induction in activated cytotoxic T-cells, differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells and B lymphocyte-mediated tumor suppression (Bobrie et al., 2011; Chaput and Théry, 2011; Taylor and Gercel-Taylor, 2011). 

[EVs which are also in Zofin stimulate growth of T-cells (the cells your body uses to fight viruses etc), cause bad cells to die by making the immune system basically break them down...all sounds really good]

-The immunomodulatory properties of MSCs-derived EVs are reported to be the result of the suppression of TNF-a and IL-1b secretion, increasing the concentrations of TGF-b, regulatory T cells (Treg) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4, inducing Th1 to Th2 cell conversion, reducing IFN-γ production and the potential of T cells to differentiate into Th17 cells (Mokarizadeh et al., 2012; Blazquez et al., 2014; Del Fattore et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016b). 

[this explains how similar therapies help modulate the immune system, I think the important part is it increases formation of certain T-cells and also stops the T-cells being formed from turning into types of T-cells that cause inflammation, inflammation is a huge problem in COVID]

-It was found, that thus obtained EVs have enhanced anti-inflammatory properties partially due to COX2/PGE2 pathway alteration.

[the therapy prevents inflammation partly because it alters a pathway that often can also result in tumorous cell growth, which also makes it potentially cancer fighting]

It also goes on and on about a multitude of diseases where this technology looks promising.",ngt4up,[],1

Medolife Rx, Inc. (""Medolife"") is a global integrated bioceutical company with R&D, manufacturing, and consumer product distribution, which is a majority owned subsidiary of Quanta, Inc. (OTC PINK: QNTA). They are in the process of getting their diluted scorpion venom drug, Escozine, approved by the FDA as an Investigational New Drug (IND). Escozine is claimed to have positive impacts on cancer treatments and also reduce the symptoms of COVID-19.


They have been submitting pre-clinical trial data for IND approval to the FDA since at least March. Approval from the FDA would allow them to conduct clinical trials in the US for Escozine.

https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/QNTA/news/story?e&id=1842198


Where Escozine has made the most progress is in the Dominican Republic.


They are opening a scorpion venom extraction facility there to get raw material for their drug. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medolife-rx-announces-extraction-facility-120000538.html


They are planning to conduct double-blind Phase II clinical trials there on human patients. 
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medolife-rx-completes-initial-meeting-120000454.html


The drug is approved for sale in Latin American countries. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medolife-rx-announces-historic-product-120000114.html


""The Company has compiled large amounts of clinical data validating Escozine’s ability to not only improve quality of life in cancer patients, but also its potential ability to kill cancer cells, as shown in numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies on various forms of cancer that led to this historic registration. Medical professionals in the DR have embraced the use of Escozine® in cancer treatment regimens for some time now, including one providing a full recommendation on the drug’s cancer-fighting and quality-of-life improving attributes.""


The main goal/gamble with this stock is, diluted scorpion venom treatments have been seen as purely anecdotal by the medical community. What would be really huge here is if they are able to clinically prove Escozine has positive impacts on treating cancer and COVID-19, among other ailments. 

https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/scorpion-venom

""The claims made for blue scorpion venom marketed to cancer patients as Escozine, Escozul, and Vidatox (a homeopathic version) are mostly based on anecdotes, testimonials, and experiments which may or may not have been properly carried out. In Cuba where these products originated, the government rejected the use of Escozul in 2009 because there was not enough data. The homeopathic version, which uses very dilute solutions of the active ingredient, has not been shown to treat or prevent cancer. The properties of blue scorpion venom are just starting to be described more thoroughly in scientific research. Therefore, like venoms from other scorpion species, blue scorpion venom compounds one day may be isolated and properly developed to create cancer therapies, but much more research is needed.""


tl;dr: $QNTA is trying to clinically and scientifically prove the efficacy of scorpion venom treatments with their drug, Escozine. They are making great progress towards this in the Dominican Republic and the US, and the price action of the stock reflects this short and long term. Something to think about!",nh0dag,[],1
