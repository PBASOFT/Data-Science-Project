100,gzsrwtw,2021-05-28,t1_gzskrte,wallstreetbets,"Well if you go on YouTube and search ‚Äústock options trading guide‚Äù you can probably find some people who can explain it to you on video and if you have any questions or are confused still after watching some guides, investopedia is a great site for learning too. 

Basically you have to understand how ‚Äúthe Greeks‚Äù work (look up that term on investopedia) before you even consider buying an option. A quick rundown on some of them is that IV (inherent volatility) has a huge influence on how expensive or cheap an option will be at the moment you buy it. The more volatile the stock is, the more each option is worth. So ideally you will want to buy when the volatility is relatively low so you can buy for cheaper. Another big factor is Theta. The sooner the option is set to expire, the higher the theta will become. Basically, options become more expensive the further out your strike price is. If you buy an option that expires a year from now, it will be way more expensive than buying one that expires next week. This can work in your favor, but it can also fuck you in the ass. If you buy a call option that expires a month from now with a strike price of say 30$, but it takes a full month for the stock price to reach 30$, even though your call option might seem like a success, theta (time decay) will ruin the price of your contract and you might lose money even though the stock reached your strike price, because basically it didn‚Äôt reach your target fast enough.

Generally speaking, most people don‚Äôt execute their options, they just sell them back to the market once they‚Äôve gone up in value. It‚Äôs actually uncommon for people to buy a call option with the intention of actually using them to buy shares.

It‚Äôs a lot to take in and it‚Äôs not as simple as betting that the stock will reach a certain price and making money once it does. The prices of options can change wildly throughout the day as the IV changes (along with the stock price).

If you are having trouble timing your entries/exits on just buying and holding shares, you‚Äôll have an insanely hard time timing options correctly. 

I am still learning the flow of options trading myself so currently I only have 1 single contract open right now. If it falls through and expires worthless then I lose 100$. I already know I messed up on timing my entry but it doesn‚Äôt expire till august so I still have time to bail on it and sell at a slight loss, or get lucky and make a little money. You definitely won‚Äôt be seeing huge gains from options until you really really understand how they work. So yeah, watch as many YouTube tutorials and if you have any questions at all just research research research until you‚Äôre confident with the knowledge you gained, and then MAYBE buy ONE single option contract to test the waters.",[],0

872,gzstki8,2021-05-28,t1_gzssrmx,wallstreetbets,"In the instance of the call option, yes, the most he could lose is what he used to purchase the options. 

Are you referring to the hedge funds?  If so, they shorted stocks. That is they borrowed shares of stock, and sold them. They are responsible for returning the same number of stock shares, no matter what the price is.  So let's say they borrowed 100 million shares at $4 and sold them, they have $400 million. They are gambling that the price of the stocks will go down.  No matter what the cost of the stock, they owe 100 million shares to the people they borrowed it from. So if the price of the stock goes down to $3 a share, they give the hundred million shares back at a cost of $300 million, and get to pocket the other $100 million.  

So now let's say the stock goes up in value, if their shares are called, they have to return that quantity of shares no matter what the cost is. A bunch of people buy into the stock, and hold the stock, and are unwilling to sell it, the price goes way up.  So if the price is now $400 a share, they still owe 100 million shares of stock to the entity they borrowed them from. No they have to buy those hundred million shares at $40 billion dollars and return them.

The stock has been under heavy attack from shorts & MM. Still struggling to break $3 despite having a catalogue of M&A worthy of at least 3x the current buy price. Wanna hear your thoughts and potential PT for 2021-2022

Hear me out the recent M&A includes

- WAVE charging
- Energica Motor Company
-Medici Motor Works (MMW)
-Mobile Energy Global (MEG)
- Treelektrik
- Timios Title & Escrow Services
- DBOT
-Solectrac
- Silk EV
- Intelligenta

Recent blowout earnings revenue increasing 8500% YOY to $32M. With $355 mil cash on hand for more M&A. For me this stock will blow in 2021-2022. Analysts have issued a PT of $7. My PT is at least $10 EOY. 

CEO Alf Poor has likened the companies prospects to the android of EV where Tesla is Apple. For sure, they're going in the right direction but it seems it needs a hand with regards to investor exposure.

‚ÄúIn Keynes' description of a liquidity trap, people simply do not want to hold bonds and prefer other, non-liquid forms of money instead. Because of this preference, after converting bonds into cash, this causes an incidental but significant decrease to the bonds' prices and a subsequent increase to their yields. However, people prefer cash no matter how high these yields are or how high the central bank sets the bond's rates (yields).‚Äù

Basically, if we are in a liquidity trap, the central bank loses it‚Äôs control of the interest rates and people will never hold debt instruments regardless of how high the yield is. The central bank has not lost control of the interest rates yet, (since the debt is still serviceable for now) nor have they raised rates to test whether people are still willing to hold debt rather than cash.",[],1

They will give you what‚Äôs called Intraday trading funds. In my case it‚Äôs been about 50 or $60,000 . which has been about double my balance. You can buy whatever you want with that money but you must sell off the same amount in the same day. Either by 4pm or 8pm. If you don‚Äôt sell off about what you used before the end of the day you Can‚Äôt get a day trade violation. Which in some cases you have to come up with the money out of pocket to get out of the violation. Yesterday I made about $2500 day trading amc. Today I lost $4500 day trading gme amc and koss . I have experience in the market and was a licensed broker for a year for Stratton oakmont( wolf of Wall Street) but I‚Äôm new to day trading and probably going back to my buy and hold strategy until I learn more about day trading.

GME closed at $222 a share. That's about $217 higher than what I believe it might be worth, maybe. So AMC? Who knows. It's the same folks holding, buying and trading it. So it can go as high as the ""apes"" conviction will allow.  


Just yesterday someone said, AMC $50. And other peeps laughed. But it could have just as easily topped at $50 as it did $35 on a day like today, a Friday ahead of a holiday. This $25 looks like a natural consolidation area, similar to the $10 had been, and may well be again. Who knows. Again, this is not a rational way.

Phones can become cheaper (lower prices) over a period of 10 years even as the money supply increases dramatically (inflation). One of the reason we don't see very many things go down in price (vehicles, housing, healthcare, etc.) despite massive productivity gains is because of inflation. Prices would otherwise go down (cheaper both nominally and in real terms). Instead, prices are now mostly stable or increase slightly every year because our policy is to steadily inflate the money supply over time. This is the same reason a good job used to pay $100 a week; now the same job pays $2000 a week.

Don't confuse velocity, money supply, inflation/deflation, price theory, and supply and demand. These are all very discrete concepts. It gets complicated when you factor in credit expansion and fractional reserve lending, but at its heart inflation is a simple monetary phenomenon, and our currency is permanently inflated in only one place (otherwise it's called ""counterfeiting"").",[],0

3615,gzt061h,2021-05-28,t1_gzsdxy0,wallstreetbets,"The theory is roughly accurate, the big point is that the premium will most definitely be higher than that if you‚Äôre buying in-the-money calls, so you could (and if it‚Äôs a stock with any show of growth, probably would) be paying a $5 premium for that call, so you‚Äôd be barely at the breakeven point.

The other point of issue that comes into play with options is that you need to have capital to exercise the options, so if you‚Äôre exercising your $10 call you‚Äôll need $1000 available to pay for the shares.  It‚Äôs generally not doable to exercise and simply try to turn around and sell the shares to recover the costs to pay for them, it starts breaking liquidation rules.

So what you may do instead is see what those calls are selling for.  Let‚Äôs say, people are paying $5 for the premium over your $.50 initial premium.  You can just sell the option to one of them for a x10 return on your $50, so $500.

You don‚Äôt need to have cash to exercise with in this case, and the returns are a lot better than what you‚Äôd have made exercising the stocks.  So if you were to buy $1000 of shares, or $1000 of options, you‚Äôd have a higher potential return from the options.  They can also crash and expire worthless, which means you‚Äôre out the $1000, whereas shares probably will still have value.",[],0

That is because inflation is measured by looking at the prices and not by the money supply. Inflation is not the money supply. I have studied economics. There is a type of inflation, demand-pull inflation, that is caused by an increase in demand relative to the supply, resulting in higher prices (again high prices is how inflation is measured, not by money supply). This demand could come from an increase money supply, but an increase in the money supply does not cause inflation. Inflation is not the money supply. Money supply increasing is not inflation. 

Traditional Fee said that money printed doesn't equal inflation and that is true. The rest of what he said, I'm not sure because I agree with your sentiment that CPI is cooked.

""**As a currency loses value, prices rise** and it buys fewer goods and services. This loss of purchasing power impacts the general cost of living for the common public which ultimately leads to a deceleration in economic growth. The consensus view among economists is that sustained **inflation occurs when a nation's money supply growth outpaces economic growth**.""

This is what I was conveying earlier about increasing the money supply to match productivity gains (to achieve price stability). As a society, we try to measure inflation by looking at prices, which is a symptom of inflation. But they are not equal. CPI is consumer price index, not consumer inflation index. There are millions of products and services which have prices, which can vary over time and space, whereas the money supply is a single concept (the supply is inflated or deflated by a central authority which issues and/or destroys said currency, in the case of our fiat system).

One of the reasons our recent (20+ years) of inflation has resulted in only ""gradual"" price increases (if we think of +10% annualized increases to healthcare, tuition costs, etc. as ""gradual"") is because most of the newly created money is concentrated in the very top 0.1% of society, and much of it is exported to other nations which use the USD to settle international trade. Hence, the things consumed only by the super wealthy (which are also very scarce or difficult to produce, such as real estate in very exclusive areas, super yachts, certain artwork, etc.) have actually increased in price dramatically. That's where a lot of actual inflation really shows up (the prices of those things consumed by the people with the vast majority of newly minted money increase in price first).

Check out the ""Cantillon"" effect, it's very fascinating. Eventually, the newly created money finds its way into the broader society and permanently elevates prices of things consumed by the common people, too",[],0

For me, at this point after watching BB take a hit in the market for months, it comes down to a few main points. 

1. The market does *not* seem to favor BB in the way that it‚Äôs lenient to the rest of the tech sector in terms of growth potential vs current revenue.

2. Good tech does not necessarily imply good revenue. BB hasn‚Äôt yet fully convinced me that they stand to make a killing off their tech, even if it‚Äôs the best in its niche.

3. Opportunity cost. How long am I willing to let this thing trade sideways before it starts reflecting the quality of its tech? What if it hits a valuation in the meme craze that reflects what its valuation should be on fundamentals in a year?

I can‚Äôt give you a price target, and anyone here who confidently throws a number out of their ass is completely full of shit. I‚Äôd honestly be surprised if it becomes stable at or above $15 EOY on non-meme valuation.

For example, you buy Stock A for $10 a share, and sell it at $12 a share. You made money. However, say the stock rallies later in the week to $30-40 a share. You could describe the experience as ""Ah shit, I paperhanded and sold at $12, now it's $30, fuck."" Generally, I've also seen it used to refer to people who sell at the first sign of trouble, instead of holding through ""paper"" losses (e.g. losses not becoming realized until you close a position). 

Profit taking is when you have already made a lot of money. Using example from before, you held Stock A from $10 to $30 a share. You can (and should) take profits. You do this by selling some of your position. So if you had 10 shares, you'd sell 5-6 depending on comfort, in order to ""take profit"" while keeping the other 5-4 in play to see if the stock continues to rise. It is basically a hedge against being up a huge % and then seeing it all wiped out by holding.

Fidelity is, IMHO, the best place to go for your situation.  Been with them for decades.  You can transfer ($75 fee waived on >$25,000) your RH in a couple days.  Initiate on a Monday and usually be up & running by Wednesday/Thursday.

You're account will be margin from the start.  Then, you can apply for Level 1: Options. The basic covered call writing & buy-writes. Stay there for a while AFTER your feel comfortable with trading those.  Option Trading is split into five level based on complexity with each level adding more advance strategies.

Level 2:  Purchase of calls/puts and straddles/combinations (equity and index)
Level 3: Spreads and covered put writing

1. Find chart patterns/analysis that works for you. There's like a billion out there, play around with a few

The maths doesnt add up, e-toro said their 1.2 GME holders are only representing 1.5% of the shareholders total, it s the most traded stock on the planet and many foreign brokers are actually changing their fucking vote policies because there re a shitton of GME holders that are asking to vote everywhere in the world.

Maybe nothing will ever happen and so be it, missing a few thousands in profits doesnt bother me at all.

Having such a massive big dick energy swing today on relative low volume is crazy bullish IMO.

It's capable of 35% or even 50% gap ups and isn't afraid to pull back to shake out the weak. Look at 12/1: opened 15% up, peaked 55% up then closed 26% down from that peak. Was that the end?

Nope, just the beginning...

1/14 was a +22% day, then it gapped 8% and peaked 26% up the next day before closing 14% down from that new high. 1/23: 28% gap up w/ +48% peak then corrected down 11% from that to close.

Still not the end...

1/27: opened up 6% then peaked 50% up to hit its momentary high of $28. Many of those happened on 300M+ volume vs 115M today.

I hope you don't think today was the end, because it was just the beginning. Don't be scared, don't be discouraged. Be happy...enjoy the long weekend and the holiday...get your exit strategy in place, because the coming week or two could be insane.",[],0

I don't know how covering the shorts is going to end, but if it's anything like 2008, there will be some serious quasi-illegal fuckery involved and retail will get screwed.

Bottom line this has turned into a speculative and emotional crusade rather than an investment in an actual stock. Nobody except us and the hedge funds are touching this with a 10 foot pole at current prices. These companies might succeed in the long term, but at current valuation guaranteed massive success is priced in, with no room for actual profit outside of muh short squeeze. Once the squeeze is squoze, if you're still holding you'll be bag holding for the foreseeable future. 

As for going whole ""going digital"" story with GME... It doesn't make any sense to me as a hardcore gamer. Why the fuck am I going to be buying anything digitally from GameStop when I can just buy it directly from steam or the appropriate console store. Maybe they buy licenses in bulk and offer them at a discount, but there's already websites that do that. If GameStop wanted to go digital they needed to start 10 years ago and establish themselves, they missed the boat at this point.

I don't know enough about AMCs fundamentals to comment on that one, but traditional movie theatres are not exactly a growth sector, especially now that people are going to expect straight to streaming releases. Maybe if they start expanding into those dinner theatres as the economy reopens there's room for growth there.

Vote with your money if your conscience demands it, but keep in mind you could be missing out on solid gains in actual companies with growth potential while your life savings are tied up in a moral crusade.

So say your average is like .50¬¢ if you sell a call at like 1.50$ strike right now on a bi monthly basis(every two weeks) you make like 7 bucks per contract. Keep in mind that it also essentially drops your average cost by the premium sold at. So if I sold covered calls against all of my shares at .07 per contract I net 7$ per contract x 50 contracts= 350$ plus I've now also dropped my average from .50 down to .43¬¢

I've been doing that with a much smaller position lately to average down and reinvest the earnings into sndl so I can sell more calls. 

I just try to go deep otm so that way my assignment risk is pretty low. If I were to get assigned on my calls I still make money... But it limits my profit potential. If I set my strike at 1.50 and the price jumps to 3  my profit potential stops at 1.50 whereas the dude who bought the call can keep on riding past 1.50.

People lose money when they act on emotions instead of sticking to their tested strategy.  Being retarded and just YOLOing on a good stonk and then never selling is an entirely viable strategy.  That's what I did with AAPL, MSFT, BIDU, and GOOG back in like 2008 when the market bottomed out and my basis on those stonks is so low that the market could lose 80% of it's value tomorrow and I'd still have made a profit (if that happened I'd actually just YOLO my entire emergency fund into something and keep holding).

I originally bought 737 shares for a lil for about $2,992 @ $4.06. I've added a lil over 200 shares since then and occasionally sell 5-10% to buy options. Since the GME Robinhood incident where they restricted selling, I ditched Robinhood and got a Ameritrade account and never looked back. That pissed me off because they also restricted Nvax on the day it biggest gains of the year. Anyway my autistic ass paniƒá sold in the February market crash to rebuy a falling knife and get a wash sale üôà. I know, I know bonehead move. So my wash sale got added to my position and gonna pay the taxman a nice visit next year. But over all not bad about $6k invested and I'm sitting at $139,720 altogether now with options and stocks. Could be worse could be better but I'mma take it with a chip on my shoulder and get ready for round 2. With all their contracts this will moon to $800 easy over the next year or so.

Now, if you want to expand that knowledge and learn more go on youtube and just watch some videos on options or Google it if you prefer reading. Search for ""options greeks"" and also just look for a video on the basics of options. Once you get this you can watch so many videos about different options strategies like covered calls, spreads, cash secured puts, etc. 

 Best thing in my opinion to follow this up is to sign up for TDAmeritrade and download Think or Swim (TOS). If you then sign into paper trading It allows you to trade stocks and options just like you would normally, but the money is fake, so you can practice any strategy or test trades you think are good to see if you're right.

8708,gztd5ez,2021-05-28,t1_gzrraz4,wallstreetbets,"I don't trust any of these analysts. With AMC, for example, most analysts were saying to sell, that it's only worth $2/share (when it was at like $8). And I was like well shit, and eventually succumbed to the groupthink and sold all mine for a small loss. If I'd ignored the ""experts"" I would be up pretty big today. 

Same with BB. Last month I sold 75% of my shares after all the analysts suddenly downgraded it from bullish to bearish (the dumb little Fidelity analyst scores on the positions page went from like 8.2 ""GOOD BUY"" to 2.0 ""SELL NOW"" like overnight). I basically broke even selling at \~8.50 but again, if I'd just ignored the BS I would be up like over 10% on those shares right now. 

I'm no longer giving these analyst ratings any credence. Plus it's the financial sector anyway, lots of money at stake and so much abstraction, who knows what fuckery is really going on. Maybe it was in some powerful player's interest for more people to sell the stock so some analysts got paid off to tell people to sell, and vwa-la; share price goes down and they can swoop in and get a free discount on bulk shares. Then later change the rating to a ""MUST BUY"" and watch the price go back up, sell for profit. Maybe that's just overly paranoid on my part but really it wouldn't be that hard to make serious money by just advertising some ""experts"" opinion to sway public behavior on a stock. But that aside, I've already missed out on profits twice now by acting on analysts' opinions instead of my own. Analysts also said GME wasn't worth shit, just about every single one of them was wrong","['GME', 'AMC']",1
