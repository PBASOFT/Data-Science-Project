47,2021-05-18,stocks," I posted this in the options subreddit but since this deals with a stock split...

Assertio (ASRT) stock split overnight

I have an open call option - 9/17 C 0.55, breakeven is 1.14

After the split, the share price jumped up to $1.60. By my dumb math, that means I could exercise the option and sell the 100 shares for a $46 profit. And the expiration is so far away, plus with the volatility of the split, I'd imagine some nice extrinsic value, too.

The problem is that the option is only trading for $8...

Why? How? If the option contract has a an intrinsic value of $46 and it has intrinsic value in it's far expiration and volatility, how is this option contract not currently valued at $50+?

EDIT: I just noticed you can't buy/sell options for Assertio right now...is this standard after a stock split?

Is this possibly the only time it makes sense to exercise my call and sell the stock? Or do I hold and the option price will catch up with reality soon?",nfdimu,[],1

462,2021-05-18,stocks,"I've embarked on creating a software that automatically detects fraud attempts through analysing a transaction history stored in CSV files. I must first fully understand the idea bheind Quote Stuffing before emplementing the necessary code.

So from my basic understanding. The fraud dude will post a large buying order of stocks of X. This would be done through HFT algorithms to ensure a large order in a small amount of time, which will task the system a lot of processing time to deal with it. When the price goes up as a result, the fraud dude will cancel their buying order and sell whatever X stocks they've got at that price, making profit.

My questions are: 

* In what form is this Large buy order executed? Are we talking about a high number of consecutive micro buys, or a single big order of an insane number of stocks.
* If, it's a successsion of micro orders, what's the appropriate time interval, from the first fake order to the last, for this to be considered a Quote Stuffing attempt. e.i a 1000 orders in 2 seconds? Can the system detect orders from other traders in between the fraudulant orders?

Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office took up new stakes in Palantir, Citigroup, and Coupang during the first quarter of 2021, regulatory filings show.

Druckenmiller scooped up 5,983,992 shares of Palantir worth $139,367,000 at the time of the March 31 filing. It's the opposite move from Third Point's Dan Loeb, who sold all of his Palantir stake in the first quarter of 2021. The big data surveillance company is down nearly 9% year-to-date. 

Like Loeb, Druckenmiller trimmed his stake in Amazon, selling 7,105 shares. His fund now holds 75,648 shares of Amazon for a value of $234,061,000 at the filing time.

Druckenmiller also added a big bet on newly public company Coupang. The Korean e-commerce company was the largest US IPO in the first quarter of 2021, raising $4.6 billion, according to Renaissance Capital. Druckenmiller added 714,285 shares.

The investor also appears to be betting on the financial sector. He took a new stake in Citigroup, purchasing 2,124,909 million shares worth $154,587,000 at the time of filing. He also scooped up 258,420 of JPMorgan Chase, and added positions in Visa and Mastercard.

Druckenmiller liquidated his positions in cyclical stocks like Disney, cruise liner Carnival Crop, and Live Nation Entertainment. However, he appears to be still betting on the rebound of travel out of the pandemic, as seen by his new $69.7 million stake in online travel company Booking Holdings Inc.

743,2021-05-18,stocks,"Full disclosure I do have some just a thousand shares. This stock was popular on wall street bets a few months ago hence the spikes. But now it’s getting close to reinstating its monthly payouts which will be hugely good news for the stock. It’s a oil and gas royalty trust and they suspended their distribution last year after the crash and racked up debt for a couple months. Because of this, distributable cash has gone to pay off the debt. It was coming off about a hundred grand a month but with the high oil prices the last month (not affected by the cold weather event in Texas which shut in production) was four hundred grand in the month. There’s approximately five hundred grand left to pay off which ought to be covered this period. So, I expect their next monthly operational update to announce dividend reinstatement.

946,2021-05-18,stocks,"This is original content copied from my other post as this community doesn’t allow cross posts but is an equally good home for it.

I’ve been doing really well and I feel like sharing my thoughts for anyone interested. These are the things I wish I had known which would have saved me a lot of setbacks.

Ignore the charts. Don’t even look at them when making a decision. Regardless of what anyone says. A chart will only tell you what has happened so far. It will never tell you what will happen next. There is one exception to this I have found but I will bring that up at the very end of this post.

Use critical thinking for any single piece of information you read about a company or the market. Who published it and why? I haven’t yet found (and probably never will find) a single news article or post with neutral information on a company. And it’s never going to happen. In the stock market there are many different players and they all have different motives. Don’t trust what a Reddit investor tells you. But also don’t trust what CNN or CNBC tell you. There is something called “bias” and you have to be able to adjust the weight you give to any information you receive based on how biased the information is or might be. Any time you get information check multiple sources. Never rely on one single source. Or even one single type of source. If you only trust major news outlets you will be mislead or worse be behind the curve. If you only trust what investing forums say you are likely to run into people who are bagholding and trying to pump the stock to be able to dump it for a higher price before it keeps tanking. The truth is somewhere in the middle. Do your own research and don’t hesitate to use Google’s “past 24 hour” search filter to make sure you’re getting the latest information.

Stay open to criticism. If you have a good idea but someone knows better, it’s not just a learning experience but it can save you from losing your money. However, only take criticism seriously if someone can properly articulate their point and isn’t just spouting catchphrases or being an asshole.

Dollar cost averaging. It’s better to make several buys into a stock than one giant buy. It’s impossible to perfectly time the market. But you will almost always get a better entry point by averaging than by throwing down all the chips on the first move.

Always do your own due diligence. If you can’t write a thesis explaining why you’re making an investment (that’s not only convincing but free of confirmation bias) then you probably shouldn’t invest. Don’t just research the company, research the market the company is in. If the company is poised to do well and corner the market but there isn’t much of a market in general then there is no future for the company. In addition, research the “target audience” not for the company but for the shares themselves. What type of investors are buying shares? Are they the opportunistic kind? Are they buying just for a quick profit to scalp before they dump the stock into oblivion, or are they buying because they see a future for the company and plan a long term hold? This can be true of institutional investors as well as retail. It’s a better sign (for now anyway) when a happy whale like Cathie buys shares banking on the future of a company than if a super-predator like Chamath is buying them for a quick flip. Always keep other investors in mind when you make a decision. Investors are the consumer that drives the price of a share.

Buy the dip but only if you have a good reason to! Don’t blindly buy every dip. I see that pushed too often on Reddit. Buying a dip is good if a company is on an upwards trend and the dip occurred randomly. Do NOT buy the dip if it’s part of a larger downtrend or if it’s possibly due to an overall change in sentiment. Worst case scenario you will multiply your loss and best case scenario you will tie up further capital on a loser which results in decreased ammunition if you suddenly find a winner. Your $500 you could have used to buy a gainer will now be $300 you can use to buy another stock.

Don’t ever hesitate to cut your losses. If a company is in a downwards trend and it looks like they will be for a while (and there is no catalyst around the corner) cut the loss. Put your money in a better place. But keep watching the ticker. You can always buy back in when the sentiment turns positive. Keep a watchlist of stocks that look promising but don’t make it so big that you lose oversight and don’t make it so small that you’re missing too many opportunities.

Gauge your performance by your method and not by your gains and losses. If you’re up 100%, be honest with yourself. Are you up because you got lucky or because you have a solid strategy? If you’re down 40%, was it because of unpredictable factors or was it your own fault because you bought due to fear of missing out which clouded your thinking? Never beat yourself up. Learn from every move you make. Remember it’s impossible to perfectly time anything. If you sold and secured a 10% gain but it could have been 15%, that’s normal. You’re never going to catch the top of a spike or the bottom of a dip. That’s like waiting in the ocean for the perfect wave. It won’t happen and you’ll drown unless you’ve learned to surf when the wave gets to you. Same with buying. Most of the time when you buy, the stock will move down. I’ve lost a small percentage at the start of almost all my well planned and well timed moves. I kept holding and the losses turned into significant gains.

Manage risk and reward. The higher the risk, the lower percentage of your profile you should put into it. Be psychologically prepared to lose everything. The more you’re willing to live with that possibility, the more you’re going to be able to keep a cool mind when taking a calculated risk.

Never stop learning. The more you know, the more of an edge you have. Get in the habit of reading several articles per day. Focus on your existing investments so you can learn how what type of news affects the markets in which ways.

Never stop looking for opportunities. They don’t come to you. You have to find them like a needle in a haystack or a diamond in the rough. You’ll get much better at finding them with time. If you don’t get good at looking for opportunities and evaluating them then you won’t have any opportunities.

Never buy in to hype. The more hyped a stock is, the more likely it is that it will tank later. Even if you find a promising company for a good long term investment, wait until the hype dies down and the share price goes down. Otherwise you’ll start your investment with a slow and steady loss.

Shares are priced based on supply and demand. There are bids and there are asks. The higher the demand is on shares the higher the bids will be. The lower the demand is on a share the lower the bids will be. What this means is that when there is more buying pressure than selling pressure the cost of a share goes up. When there is more selling pressure than buying pressure the cost of a share goes down. In fact, that is all a chart will really tell you. Think of a chart as a historical look at past buying and selling pressure. Nothing more and nothing less. The price direction is determined only by buying and selling pressure.

The value of a share is subjective. You can run any equation you want to but there is no equation which links any of the variables of a company to the price of a share. There are many different ways to “value” stocks. DDM, DCF, price to earnings, price to book, enterprise value to EBIDTA, Technicals...and they all mean nothing. Why? Because the value of a share is what people are willing to pay for it. A stock is no different than a consumer good. Take, for example, iPhone. If you compare the iPhone 12 to android phones with similar specs the iPhone 12 price tag more than doubles some lesser known brands with the same specs. But people are willing to pay more for the iPhone. So the iPhone costs more. The value of a share is the same. If people are willing to pay more for a share of a company then those shares will cost more even if there is no mathematically verifiable reason.

There is no formula based on the specs of a phone which will predict what the retail cost of the device will be. Just like there is no formula which will take any company metrics into account and determine the price of a share.

Stocks go up and stocks go down. Everyone hates red days. But they’re normal and they’re not a sign you’re doing something wrong. They mostly move when there are catalysts that have either positive or negative effects on sentiment. The rest of the time they will trade sideways or slightly downwards. As long as the slope isn’t steep and there have been no bad news about the company having a red day is fine. In fact if a stock was only green all the time I would probably sell it because that could be a good sign it’s in a bubble and bubbles are known for bursting.

The biggest gains and losses in the market are driven by the biggest changes in investor sentiment. And investor sentiment isn’t rational. It’s irrational. For example there could be some slight bad news about a company which will have no bearing on the bottom line (for example a brief delay in a crucial step) which hits a nerve and causes an emotional overreaction which causes the stock to tank. Or there could be some neutral news about a company which investors mistakenly perceive as positive causing the stock to skyrocket.

Catalysts don’t matter. People’s reactions to the catalysts matter. If you look into a company that has upcoming catalysts, don’t focus on how the catalysts will effect the bottom line for the company. Focus on how the catalysts will impact investor sentiment. For example, if a company decides to increase the cost of a pharmaceutical product and they are now going to make 12 billion more dollars over the next 5 years, that’s great for the company. But if people are upset and there is bad publicity like “My mother died because she couldn’t afford her diabetes medication after the price hike.” then the value of a share will go down.

The biggest gains are in speculative investing but they also carry the highest risk. The reason that speculation has the biggest potential for gains is strictly due to human psychology. Investors are going to be a lot more fearful to invest in a company which isn’t generating revenue or where the future of a company has no proven results to back it up. Even if that company is going to cure cancer. But that’s also why there is the potential for a huge reward. If you can find a company investors are fearful to invest in now and you have enough data about the company to conclude that they are going to be successful, then you can actually turn a speculation into a somewhat more secure investment. 

For example, if a company announces that they found a cure for alzheimer’s. And you just happen to be a neuroscientist. If you understand the science and you instantly realize that they have a disruptive breakthrough, you can now use that to your advantage. You can invest in the company now with the knowledge that the science is solid. This gives you an edge. You know that you know the company will be a success. But you also know that anyone who isn’t a neuroscientist will have little faith in the company. As a result, you have now found a company which is setup for a massive change in sentiment. So you buy 10,000 shares for $0.03. Eventually, the company moves through to phase 3 clinical trials and the product gets approved. The news headlines hit that a company cured alzheimers. Now the shares you bought for $0.03 are suddenly worth $15. Your degree in neuroscience just paid off better than your actual day job as a neuroscientist. As the stock keeps trending upwards the $300 you spent is now $150,000. This gain is mostly attributable to using your existing knowledge to get ahead of a pivot in investor sentiment.

Use what you know. Just like the example above. Everyone has areas they are more or less knowledgeable about. If you know a lot about technology, focus on technology stocks. If you are a geologist, focus on mining stocks. Anyone can have an advantage. Even if you’re working at a deadbeat job and you get a free sample for an air freshener that finally actually gets rid of the smell of stale cigarettes in your well used car, invest in that air freshener. Any single piece of knowledge you have about any single thing can be used to your advantage to make a trade.

Which company evaluations actually do matter? Is the company going to be able to survive? That’s the main thing I’ve been looking at with my speculations. A company could have come out with a technological breakthrough. But do they have the funding or an existing revenue stream to carry it out? Are they going to be consumed by debt and implode or are they getting funding in one way or another? Another important one is if another company will buy them out. If a company has mediocre performance and is going to be bought out by Microsoft that can be great for your investment. But if a company has a breakthrough, doesn’t have the resources to commercialize it themselves and has to give in to the highest bidder for a buyout then the upside to your investment is going to be a lot more limited.

Those are really the only company metrics I’m focused on.

Stay up to date on your investments. Don’t just look at your portfolio once a month and complain about it going up or down. Is your chart going up? Find out why. Is your chart going down? Find out why.

Stay ahead of the news! If it’s 5am and you have to get up for work, get in the habit of quickly checking the news on your tickers so that you can stay on top of any changes. The sooner you know bad news came out the more likely it is you will be able to hit the sell button before anyone else does. If you have tickers you’re watching, try to buy in the moment there is good news or in advance of the good news. Especially if the sentiment is positive.

Be careful with stop losses. If you don’t know what a stop loss is, it basically means that you have set up your purchase so that your broker will sell your shares for you if they dip below a certain amount. They can be great for risk management but they can also screw you over. If you bought a company for $10 and you have a stop loss at $8 you won’t be happy when it dips to $7.50 before shooting up to $20. Because now your stop loss actually worked against you. You lost a +100% gain and you secured a loss. Another time stop losses can be unhelpful is if your stock is trading on a foreign exchange as well. For example, if you have a stock on the NASDAQ trading for $10 and a stop loss for $9 but it also trades on a European exchange. It the stock closes at $10 but tanks overnight and trading opens at $5 on the NASDAQ, your stop loss will have done nothing. Even worse, it’s possible your stop loss won’t be triggered at all now because the system won’t pull the trigger while the price of the shares continues to drop.

Market buys, market sells, limit buys and limit sells. I see a lot of confusion about this online and quite a few people get limit orders mixed up with the bid-ask spread. Small fish investors like retail have nothing to do with the bid-ask spread. When you place a market buy order through your broker you are agreeing to purchase a set number of shares at the current market price. I never use market orders. Why? Because if you execute a market buy or a market sell and the price of the security changes rapidly it won’t fill at all. And in order to cancel it and place a new order you first have to find it, then cancel it and then place a new order. I always use limit orders. If I’m buying shares and the cost looks like it’s on an upwards trend I will always place a limit buy for a price quite a bit higher than the current market value. Some people seem to think you won’t get the best price possible that way but this is wrong. If a stock is trading for $8 and you put in a limit buy for $8.50 but the stock only goes up to $8.10 your broker will fill it at $8.10. If I’m buying shares and the cost of the security looks like it’s currently on a downwards trend I will place a limit buy just a bit above what I think it will drop down to. That way I don’t have to stare at the chart all day and I can check throughout the day and place a new order if the direction changed and it didn’t fall below that point yet. As far as selling goes I will always place limit orders as well to guarantee the trade goes through instead of putting faith in a lack of volatility and risking the sell not going through. If the stock is going down I will place a limit sell for a lower price. If the stock is going up I will place a limit sell for a higher price. I won’t make them too much higher or too much lower though because this is the opposite of buying and I don’t want the stock to get stuck to my hands when I’m trying to dump it.

Since investor sentiment drives the price of shares, wouldn’t it be nice if there was a single quick way to gauge the current investor sentiment towards a company? As it turns out, you can! And you can do it really quickly by eyeballing a chart even if you don’t have a clue what you’re doing. Here’s how. Take a look at the chart. Focus on points in the chart where there have been sudden upwards and sudden downwards movements. And look at what happens following those movements.

If the stock dropped 12% due to some bad news, what happens next? Does it stay down or does it climb back up? The quicker it climbs back up out of a dip, the more positive investor sentiment is.

If the stock jumped up 12% due to some good news, what happens next? Does it stay up and slowly keep rising or does it tank back down to levels even lower than before the spike? The quicker it drops back down after a spike, the more negative investor sentiment is.

Keep in mind though that investor sentiment can change and just because there has been overall positive or negative sentiment in the past does not mean that the sentiment will continue. Check news for any updates on the company. Make sure nothing is in the works that could cause the sentiment to change to the negative when you are buying in. Check stock message boards. Check financial news. Use your brokers news feed, they are often quicker to the punch.

It’s definitely more profitable to buy something that has overall positive sentiment.

Edit: I will add, don’t ever be afraid to re-evaluate your strategy. If it isn’t working there’s a good chance it will keep not working. It’s better to try something new than to watch your portfolio slowly erode while you have plenty of time to research and make new moves.",nfj008,[],0

On the inverse, the price dropped to 8.30 but the sell price was at 8.43. What’s up with the price difference? Is it just behind the actual market?",nfj9h4,[],1
