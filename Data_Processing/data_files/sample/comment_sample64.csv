1091,gzoiu89,2021-05-27,t1_gzo57sg,wallstreetbets,"7.75 is a better price than mine.  I'm averaging about 8.20.

Definitely sell the options rather than exercise if they have any time value left.  You can always use the money to buy more shares if you want.

For example if the share price is $9.50 but you can sell your options for $0.55, that's better than exercising.  Exercising would throw away $0.05/share.  If you want to own the shares you can always use the $9 you would have used to exercise, plus 50 cents of what you go out when you sold the options to buy shares.  That way you pocket the extra $0.05/share.

The only time it really makes sense to exercise is if you can't get the full intrinsic value because of liquidity problems.  Like if the share price was $9.50 but you couldn't sell the options for $0.50 or more, then exercising makes sense.  That's pretty rare though; usually it's pretty easy to close the position at a fair price.",[],0

For example, if you put all that 365k into SPY, assume an 11% average yearly return for 10 years with dividends reinvested and you'd have about 1 million in 10 years without adding anymore money. 

That's not including the 150k more that OP made and it's not including any further investment. If you just take OPs 500k and put it into SPY, use the 10% lifetime historical average return, add no extra money to it AND don't reinvest your dividends, they'd be just shy of a million in 8 years.

And shorts surprisingly have not covered. Yesterday, amc had 90 million short volume and si actually went up the past few days. Amc had went up 20% and shorters lost over $700 million that day alone.

So when I bought the $15.50 call the stock price was around $13 and I paid $.59 ($59) per contract. So at the time of my purchase the break-even price would be $16.09. (15.50 strike price plus .59) ... 

Now immediately after I bought it the stock price went up to $15.50. I then sold the calls for $1.12 each because value of the contracts go up in relation to the stock price. So the person who bought them from me would need the stock price to get to $16.72 ($15.50+$1.12). 

So I took the money from my calls and I rolled them to cheaper options which were $18 strike price calls that only cost .55 ($55) per contract. So I was betting that the price was going to go above $18.55 by expiration day Friday. It allowed me to buy more contracts at a cheaper price but with a lot more risk because I don't know if the price was going to go past 18.

You have to wait for the shares to settle so you can't do it all in one day. But maybe if you rollover the cash it would be faster. The goal of doing the rollover is that you aren't allowed to fund a Roth IRA if your income is high enough in that year. If GME/AMC shoots the moon then your straight Roth deposit would be invalid.

By putting it in a traditional first, then rolling it over, you can bypass the income requirements.

Because if people sell on friday your shares will be null and won't count towards the total shares held by retail. Thus helping to hide the amount of synthetic/fake shares hedgies have injected into amc.

And shorts surprisingly have not covered. Yesterday, amc had 90 million short volume and si actually went up the past few days. Amc had went up 20% and shorters lost over $700 million that day alone. 

Now today amc runs up to 36%? Shorters are fuk, and they fucking dumb too",[],0

3866,gzonlv9,2021-05-27,t1_gzolel4,wallstreetbets,"Sure. Let’s ignore whether there are hidden shorts, fails to deliver, etc. etc. for a second. For purposes of this discussion, I will concede the validity of all of that due diligence (even though I think 99.9% of it is complete nonsense, just for full disclosure). 

During the first short squeeze at the end of January, large swaths of retail were disallowed from buying GME which ultimately alleviated the squeeze. There is zero reason to suspect this wouldn’t happen again. If hedge funds, the DTC and brokerages really are staring at potential insolvency and financial collapse, there’s nothing they won’t do to prevent it. Likewise with the SEC itself. They will not let a single stock bring down the global economy - they’ll halt trading in it long before that happens. So what if they have to go testify in front of Congress again - they’ll still be in business and people will move on. Retail simply does not have a way to counter this. Retail is playing a game where if by some stroke of luck they caught lightning in a bottle again, hedge funds, brokerages and the SEC would change the rules again before the squeeze approached anything resembling $1,000,000 a share. It’s not going to happen - it’s a pipe dream.",['GME'],0

Watching the hedgies fight it and make it stronger is also very satisfying but the charts show gme will win and very soon they will be a $1,000+ stock permanently due to the number of people who just wont sell ever.

“Smart money” traders went to schools that taught to sell to lower the price. But degenerate apes are not respecting that principle. Stock goes up apes buy, stock goes down apes buy more. This unknown behavior is making them dig a bigger hole.

So retarded it's brilliant.  

This is why you Buy and Hold. 
Don't be shocked if they cause panic tomorrow.   They are dying for people to sell off their position with the June 2nd stock count starting.  If your stock isn't settled into your account by then, then you won't be counted for those shares. 

Today wasn't even  remotely a squeeze. Just Retail FOMO glomming  on.  Imagine a day with 1 billion in volume.  

Shorts lost over 800m just today on AMC, and are still doing it- which means they haven't even begun to cover.   

The next few weeks are huge, but the rules are simple.  
1. Buy
2. Hold 

Enjoy today's success!

4743,gzop9tt,2021-05-27,t1_gzo7gi2,wallstreetbets,"There’s a chain of responsibility for failing entities. It goes something like this:
hedge funds, market makers, etc. -> banks -> DTCC -> Federal Reserve and/or Federal Government (Treasury)

If a hedge fund can’t stay afloat, they get liquidated and that money goes to covering the costs of their outstanding liabilities (including buying shares to close short positions). If that’s not enough, the entity that margin called them (e.g. a bank) will have to pay the difference. If the bank can’t stay afloat, then they will also get liquidated (or get a bailout or get acquired by a competitor).

If the group of all involved entities fails (hedge funds and banks and whoever else that has outstanding short positions), then the DTCC has to pay the costs…i.e. buy the shares to close out short positions. The DTCC reported has a $63Trillion insurance policy. If that fails, then the FR/Treasury have to step in.

Note: i’m repeating/summarizing part of the DD that is available in the other subs, so apologies if i got something wrong. But the gist of it is: someone is always responsible and will have to pay to close out the outstanding short positions.",[],0

MT5 trades use static margins which don't change for a position once opened. In a demo account whenever you open a position, you will have a column telling you the margin.
Your account value has to be always above that value.

If it goes below that value, you will get a mail, to put more money in. If you didn't and you account value drops further, reducing the account value at 50% of margin number, your positions will be closed.

On one hand, just because something has a 1 in 50 chance doesn't mean it'll happen within 50 attempts. It could take 100 attempts or 200 attempts. Theoretically, you could try it a million times and not succeed once (although this is very unlikely). So, you'd probably want to have enough money for more than 50 attempts. On the other hand, in reality there are more outcomes possible than simply either winning $500k or losing all of your money. You could pull your money out early if things don't look good and cut your losses. You might also have some attempts that result in smaller wins than $500k. Like, maybe you turn your $10k into $20k.

Calculation Formula:  
Margin = current price x trading volume / leverage  
For ex, Its 1% of the contract value for 1:100X leverage  
  
For example, if an account has 1:500 leverage and opens a 1 standard lot (100,000) in EUR/USD, assuming EUR/USD price being 1.19107 then the required margin is as following:  
(100,000\*1.0588)/400 = $238.214

5712,gzoqxbs,2021-05-27,t3_nmg57b,wallstreetbets,"Listen retards, today was a crazy day, not only for GME and AMC, but for a smaller not known company called Provention Bio (PRVB). Knowing that this is bound to get some downvotes because some of you will think I'm distracting from the larger MOASS goal, I think it would be wise to read this. 

For over two decades, multiple companies have been trying to get a drug called ""Teplizumab"" approved by the FDA. For various reasons that are very complex, it hasn't been. Today, Provention Bio went in front of an FDA advisory committee to get their blessing on approval. While the FDA is not bound to the committee's recommendations, they very rarely dissent. About 10 minutes ago, the advisory committee voted 10-7 IN FAVOR of approving the drug, however, they had serious concerns about the safety data and would like to run post-marketing trials. 

This is a HUGE win for Provention Bio as it greatly improves the likelyhood of FDA approval which is slated to review Teplizumab on July 2nd. What that means is the stock price is probably going to rocket up tomorrow first thing in the morning (most likely pre-market). Today the FDA halted trading on the stock so the price is still very very temporarily suppressed (it would have cratered if the committee voted no on approval).

Stop for a moment and think: what are my life goals? Why did I enter this trade? What do I want to get out of it? What can I do with the profit I'm looking at right now? If I was looking at this for the first time, with $0 in, would I enter now at these prices?

Take it from me, I left $100k+ of GME profit on the table and watched it all burn because I lost sight of the bigger picture. What do you think will feel worse: Missing out on a few % more gains, or watching it crash and being left with 90% less than what you could take now. Do you want to be able to tell a story about how you got 10x, 20x, 100x gains, or a sad sack story about how you ""could have"" had whatever you have now, but blew it and missed out.

You can't call the top, if you try to achieve some magical beautiful exit where you sell everything exactly at the top, you will get burned.

So if I am poor and can only afford $1 for the stock I can still get in on the gains.  my losses are also limited to $1 since I can’t go below $0.",[],0

It’s useful to buy one when you are worried an investment of shares you have might go down in value (below the strike). If it does you get to sell your shares for the strike. If not, you bought peace of mind for the premium. 

The seller of the put has to put up collateral to buy the shares (so 100 * strike price). And they get paid a premium. If the stock goes below they start losing money. If the stock doesn’t go below strike, they got free premium.

>Since late November 2020, 85,918,776 total shares of the company have been sold short in the U.S., according to the Buyins.net report.
That means an average of 57.16% of the company’s shares traded every day in the U.S. look like they have been sold short.
In Canada, the numbers seem even larger. The report shows that a shocking 113,188,174 shares of the company have been sold short since May 24, 2016 (inferred from US short selling average in RECAF).

so hell - heres a **different** subject : 

Here's a game to play when you're bored.. toss a coin once.. it will land either Heads or Tails = 50:50 chance .. easy, right? .. We know that. 

Now toss it ten times - on AVERAGE ten tosses will give you 5 heads, 5 tails. Right?  
So will you put your money down and bet you get 5 and 5  just throwing the coin ten times only. (not 4 and 6 - not 3 and 7.. just 5:5 to win)

Should be 50:50  chance that you get 5 of each

.. er .. right?

Made some cash, lost it quick. Rode the second wave of GME and started feeling really good. Thought all I touched turned to gold after nailing the RKT jump too. Made some wrong moves but was still ahead. Dove deep and invested more money and then grew my portfolio from 10k to 14.5k. I know that’s small but as someone who believed it was index funds or nothing it was a high I won’t soon forget. However, after feeling like hot shit and making some bad moves while folding like a little bitch I was down to 2.8k. Don’t ask about my shit moves lol. However, I’m getting back on track and this is my fun money. I’m hoping I’ll be able to change my families financial outcomes majorly in the next 5 years. It’s been a lot of fun, but recently I’ve found myself down a lot with my current account balance, we are now back to 4k though. So all that to say, just remember you may find the right move, you may find 5. But there are many moves that will crush you. Be smart, be safe, don’t invest what you’re not willing to lose. 

And most importantly remember your family, friends, and people around you matter a lot, and you matter a lot to them.

Oh! And most importantly…

Q1 2022 is the foretold date of FID at which point this should be a $15 dollar stock.

My family is going to be homeless on Sunday. My dad is in a coma and his work is fucking him out of his retirement money. The city bought the place we were living and are kicking us out to the street. The USPS won't let us get our mail and are returning it all back to sender. Shelters are full of the 100k+ prisoners California released because of covid. People who are convicted child rapists, people involved in theft rings, people who go around shooting other random people just because. This last week alone 3 people, including a 6yr old kid, were shot and killed while in a car on the freeway! Its getting worse rapidly. Each one of us is medically jacked up in some form and even when we tried to get a job recently as things have been opening up, we are turned away because we don't have an address, don't seem reliable because how much is going on, and we don't have everything they want. We've been living in poverty our whole lives and I dont want to see my parents suffer anymore. My dad's worked for the same place for 35 years and when he went into his coma, they basically stole his retirement. My moms had a heart attack and has 8 stints and now sleeps alone without her husband after 30 years next to each other. The long term care facilities that my dads been to have been mistreating him. They've dropped him on his face, he's had infections, rashes, and sores they couldn't explain (except the bed sores he has), and he even ended up with a UTI. Thats absolutely unacceptable. My dad's sacrificed everything he ever had and always chose others over himself and this is how he gets thanked? We've been trying every day to make a better life and get anywhere to live and every day some agency or organization steps in and shits all over it. Its pushed me to the point where I'm only living to make sure my dad gets taken care of. I've sold everything I have just to make it this far. I dont understand the market or how to get started and I dont have any money to invest. I found all my pokemon card collections going back to at least 98 but I dont have the time to sell them or wait for them to get graded. My dad is laying on a cold hospital bed able to hear everything but unable to see or move. Imagine being in that situation. I love my dad and I never got to spend a lot of time with him and the morning he had his asthmatic episode, we all did what we could to keep him alive. He ended up dying on my shoulders and with the help of a stranger, my brother, and the paramedics, we got a heartbeat after 5 minutes. The system is not helping us, the city state and government assistance programs refuse to help, and we're 2 days away from living on the street. Im not asking for free shit, im asking to barter your skills for my skills or time once I can secure somewhere to live. This is no fake b.s. and im not a prince from Zimbabwe. Im from a shithole town in Southern California full of fucked up people. I just want to see my family smile for once..",[],0

Alright retards listen up this is a huge play that keeps getting auto-modded out because of market cap but it's on fire, still cheap, and institutional and HFs are buying it on value.

Stock has been beaten down, with a current market cap under 200mm, despite the fact that they will have 60mm in net after-tax cash on hand at the end of the year. They also have a state of the art manufacturing plant built in 2010 for 400mm, which is finally operating at a profit.

And as of Q1 this year, their Cash on hand was greater than their outstanding debt. The balance sheet is shaping up beautifully. 

Retard math:

400mm plant built in 2010, say it could be liquidated for 200mm

60mm in guaranteed govt incentive a/t cash flow left in 2021

At least 10mm ebitda in 2022 from newly signed CABOT deal

Newly acquired water purification segment saw positive ebitda for the first time, about $2mm

$200mm + $60mm + $10mm + 2mm / 19mm shares

=

$14.31 in liquidation value based on immediate financials. No debt.

Why is this stock only 8 dollars?

It was picked up in VIC last week and the stock has been running ever since. Cool to see one of my ideas picked up by real time traders!

If you *strongly* believe your meme is higher quality than all the memes currently on r/wallstreetbets/hot, then you may message the moderators.

It's fine that you can't afford to buy all 50 contracts back because in the same trade you're selling 50 new contracts for an overall credit (preferably). 

In Robinhood go to AMCs options and set your settings to buy calls, then go to your contract and just long press on it (in the menu with all the contracts) and you'll see little boxes pop up next to all the options in the chain, and your may 28th 19c will have a little check in it's box. Now switch the settings to sell calls, and change the expiration to any date past your call, and then you can just tap any contract and then you'll see the order menu at the bottom change from ""Long Call"" to ""2-Option order"", hit it and roll that motherfucker.

Also it's preferable to sell calls for more than you brought your calls back for, so you overall earn a credit.",[],0

9646,gzoyhh9,2021-05-27,t3_nmitn3,wallstreetbets,"Lots of disparaging comments here; this is certainly the wrong subreddit for AMC these days. So, here’s a different view point for you:

Yes, 500k sounds overly excessive. Yet, the point is that there’s increased short interest against AMC again, and today’s share ride actually increased the amount of shorts despite now crazy high loan fees.

The idea of people holding on to AMC for better or worse is this (in a nutshell):

a) not many big whale‘s are left holding AMC, they nearly all cashed out at this point. The 3.5 Million individual share holders are mostly “retail investors”, and they are not as quick to cash in. A big majority is waiting for the stock to go WAY higher (as in ballistic) before even thinking of selling based on the group thinking (which happens on other subreddits). People are calling to wait for truly life-changing money. A lot of the small investors are still doubling down by buying more.

b) if the stock price keeps increasing at this rate, the banks will start asking hedgies and other shorters for increasing risk coverage on outstanding shorts, which will result in the first Margin calls. That will mean some of those shorters need to cover by buying real shares. With not much float out there, that will drive the price way up, which will result in more Margin calls. Do that cycle a couple of times, and you have calls on all shorts… which means they’ll buy whatever they can get at any price, at least that’s the theory. When that first big amount of calls might start, there’s several different opinions I’ve seen amongst the more savvy redditors. Some say as soon as $30 (we got briefly close to  that today), others $50, $80, $100.

Make up your own mind. I’m personally enjoying the current ride. I love green numbers in my accounts.

TLDR, its possible.

Long answer:

There is a pretty serious theory - arguably it is actually just a fact not a theory - that due to the fact that more shares have been shorted than exist - the stocks can be sent into an infinite loop short squeeze.

This got very very serious with GME in particular a couple months ago.

The trouble is that this will bankrupt the people who run the entire financial system.

But the infinite loop never triggered, instead the market makers stepped in and halted buy trading, but allowed sell trading on like 1/4 of all trading platforms.

Some folks in suits went on record in some federal hearings and confirmed that most people don't realize the market almost collapsed.

AMC could go to $1000. 

If it does, it will bring the whole fucking stock market down.
