Perhaps Thiel recognized the value of data integration at PayPal but PLTR was founded significantly through Cohen, Thiel, Lonsdale, and Gettings. Karp got brought in as interim CEO and ended up being such a good fit that he was kept on as acting CEO.

That said, agree with your reasoning for why PLTR will be a giant in the marketplace, their potential success within government and it's timeliness with AI investment in the west to keep pace with China. Also believe people are underestimating the commercial growth they are likely to see. Very exciting company, I am essentailly all in as well.

71,gzqh3bm,2021-05-28,t1_gzp1qt7,StockMarket,"I don't even know how you can claim this bullshit. Short interest on AMC has been floating below 20%, and more than likely ~5% of those shorts are retail shorts betting on the asset going back to the norm, so maybe just maybe there's an institutional short volume of 10-15% on AMC, not nearly enough to cause any sort of short squeeze. 

I very do much agree the recent uptick in price is caused mostly by the options chain expiring ITM and retail pumping it, but the most AMC could be with all 10-15% of those shorts covering at once would maybe be $35-40 total given the massive sell volume, but they won't cover all at once, and it'll probably decline tomorrow. 

No one was selling GME, more AMC today was sold than the top 500 companies. GME had a greater short interest than there was available to buy, while AMC just has a small fraction of what is available to buy. 

The whole purpose of a short squeeze on the caliber of 500-1000% gains is having to buy up the whole ask side of the order book, they don't have to do this with AMC, as there's enough volume to only increase the price a bit while covering the entire position.

You need profit targets and the most CRUCIAL part to a trading plan.....A stop loss.
Have to stop that will say ‚Äúif my TA fails and I am wrong i will exit here‚Äù

You say your charting is perfect, but yet you are bag holding.

I‚Äôll give you an example how i traded BNGO yesterday. 
I saw Bngo consolidating within a tight bull flag on the 30 min at around 6.03-6.07 before market opened.  I built out a position at 6.04.
Now on why i love bull flags, is because your stops can be a little tighter.  If this flags fail, under 5.95 i can say this pattern will fail and i can exit here for 9 cent loss.  

Pattern fails, i get stopped out around 100 dollar loss, about 1/3 my max loss.
I reevaluate the play.  Market all tanked at open but then show signs of strength on the dip, so i built a position on the next dip. 5.88 with a 5.76 stop.  1 cent under the low of the day , so if it hits my stop im either changing to short because the trend is now downside or i move on to a different play.

Bngo runs up to 6.20 i make up my losses and then some and im holding to 1/3 shares of my current shares to see how far it will go with my stop at my break even.

Its ok to be wrong, im stopped out often, thats a good thing.  Now if you are constantly getting stopped out, then your TA actually sucks.

My strategy is to first check 1 month chart with daily intervals.  I plot the upper and lower levels of the channel that SPY seems to bounce around in.  I wait for 3 different signals to give me the go:  When it reaches near the bottom of the channel, when MACD begins to reverse, and when SQZ MOMO begins to reverse or revert to the green.  At this point I buy call contracts for the next monthly expiry 30+ days out.

I find that SPY has enough liquidity that can I can often times even do a market order and have a nonexistent spread.  If it makes a big move, often times I will take profits and reopen a later expiry if there's still room to grow.  It's not subject (as greatly) to bad earnings calls, dividend payout dates, bad news within a company, and a bunch of other common causes for volatility.

Also they have massive amounts of cash they're extremely financially healthy go look at their last financial statements. They have almost no liabilities at all it's just lending rates are so cheap they basically would be irresponsible not to borrow a little and compared to the cash they have it's nothing. 

You realize that they're issuing that amount of shares because of how much they know they're growing and about to grow. It's because their current prospects are that good. You realize giving stocks to executives like Karp is how they become a public company right?? They give him X amount of overall shares and that represents his previous ownership from when they were private..... stock based compensation isn't like the company spending money lmao. It's also only worth billions because of the share prices of what the public investors are willing to pay... Regardless its not coming out of the companies pocket and it's a fixed amount of total dilution that was decided on before they DPO'd.... 

They don't sell shares on the market and then give the cash to employees.... that's not what sbc is... sbc is the best way for people NOT to cash out early....

If you even read my post you'd realize that NOONE is cashing out. I mean I don't think you read a single thing I said. It's almost pathetic. They have a normal stake in their company. They're not squandering anything. Thiel talks about stock based compensation as being the best way to motivate employees because they have the most incentive to make the company better.

I bought 158 shares at roughly $12.02 AVG ($1,900ish). Once we hit $19.5, I started slowly securing some. I only intended to make 50% on the trade as a whole and secure my original investment. I sold 108 Shares and secured my original investment plus a little. I'm still sitting on the 58.

I'm not new to the stock market but I started trading Cryptocurrency in 2015. I've learned what works best for me is to set my goals from the beginning and try to stick with that original goal as much as possible and be happy. That can be more difficult than it sounds though especially with a Stock like AMC when it's getting so much attention.

Not sure if you guys in the adult stock subs are aware but GME has maintained an average between 10x and 100x it‚Äôs 52 week low for the last 5 months. 

In recent news, they have seemingly solved the biggest problem of the gaming industry, digital resale of games using NFTs.  

Despite recent developments, Wall Street speculators continue to short it, probably because they don‚Äôt understand the tech behind crypto well enough and they also think they can trick us into selling. 

I think GME is still undervalued at 250 given the potential of their team with the amount of cash they have, but as an added bonus they are set up to squeeze like we have never seen due to the amount at which they were shorted at 3, 10, 40, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 dollars.

1: Having a position in a stock in no way shape or form makes a source of information untrustworthy. There's no such thing as bias here there is being wrong about your information and being right about your information. If anything those (in this situation me) have the most to lose have done the most research so my ""bias"" aka my interest in the stock is just that. Interest in the stock. I didn't buy it and then develop bias I researched it and therefore saw a reason to buy it. 

If consider someone doing research and therefore gaining conviction in why a stock is worth buying as a sense of something not to be distrusted than you're going to have a really hard time in markets over the long term. 

Just because people have written say 10 bear cases and 10 bull cases doesn't mean that there's no real answer or even that the answer is somewhere in the middle because they were both ""biased"" . The answer is one of them is correct and it's about the quality of information they found. High quality information of course gives me a ""bias"" of being bullish. But it doesn't have any relevance or relation to the accuracy of my information. 

You can check my information in a few short minutes and discover that it is accurate. You just don't like someone calling you out for having an absurdly uninformed opinion. 

You can claim its defensiveness all you want but no its not having an appetite for LOW QUALITY information which is what you're putting out. It's not because I'm biased it's because I know with 100% pure certainty that you're wrong. Because I've done the research. If me doing intensive quality research makes me ""biased"" then that's the dumbest thing I've ever had. 

Stocks don't go up based on belief. I don't buy stocks on belief. I do research and develop probabilities in my head and buy based on my risk/returns that fit my goals and situation. 

Your information was entirely wrong and I'm not being defensive by pointing it out. People who point out flat eathers are wrong aren't being defensive but if they seem incredulous at the level of misinformation that gets out then that's just an externality of how wrong they are. My incredulity which you are painting as defensiveness is just a factor of how incorrect you are. If anything you're the one being defensive by turning the debate about my ""personality' and painting me as biased because I've done actual research. 

If you were right you had literally ample time to prove me wrong it would've taken minutes, instead you sit here claiming I can't be trusted because I'm vested in a company that I've put actual 100s of hours of research into. Like duh. No I have better information because I'm so invested. I'd be an idiot not to do research on something I've put so much money into. 

Also if you think me making a post on reddit is actually going to get me significant gains on a stock of a 30 billion dollar company than you clearly are insane. What reason do I have to convince people on here? There's thousands of posts every week. Mine isn't needed I just see so much dump posts that are completely incorrect like YOUR comment that I wanted to set the record straight. The fact that your only response has been to call me defensive and biased and untrustworthy instead of pointing to ANY tangible information of why my information is incorrect just proves 100x over that I'm at least way more informed than you on the topic. 

Good luck and I hope you learn to digest information based on quality comparisons of tangible proofs rather than relying on your personal beliefs about someone's tone of the text they wrote on the fucking internet and your Freudian analysis of my intentions. Like woah the guy who wrote pages of DD on palantir thinks its going up???? Mind blown. Guess he's wrong because he has conviction enough to buy the stock based on all his work he put in üòÇüòÇüòÇ",[],0

428,gzrs3wj,2021-05-28,t1_gzr22cu,StockMarket,"Because SI isn't reported like you think it is. Those are SI estimations, while SI is only reported accurately twice per month. 

It's almost always close to correct, but usually wrong by percentages. For instance with GME, it was reported that the estimated short interest 2 weeks after the first squeeze in January was still over 100%. When the SEC finally reported, it showed it was less than 40%. Therefore, 100% of the short volume closes their positions, but estimations weren't aware of that, and chose to believe they didn't. 

Also, keep in mind that gamma squeezes on volatile stocks like this are almost non existent, why? Most options are covered calls and PUTs on volatile assets, meaning they have already bought the shares a long time ago, and just transfer them when they expire. When you exercise a PUT for the right to buy shares at that price, you're 99% likely to not actually buy the shares, but to receive them by someone who bought them when they sold you the contract months ago. 

If your cost basis is as low as you think it is, sell today. Even if you're bullish still on AMC against all odds, remember that we have a 3 day weekend and that usually isn't good for volatility, people will likely sell off today EOD and buy back on Monday, you should take profit now and buy back lower if you truly believe.","['GME', 'AMC']",0

That's not the case at all. I'm just trying to share my viewpoint on this stock that I feel doesn't get enough love. WSB gatekeepers threw me off that sub because this is ***not*** a pump & dump. So I picked up and moved over here.

This seems like the kind of comment in the same ballpark as ""This band... all their stuff sounds the same.""  
Well, yeah. It's the same 4 dudes with the same 4 instruments who wrote all of the songs in the same 2-month span. Of course all of the shit on that album sounds the same.  
Yeah... I took the same information over to a sub that wouldn't kick me out because my post wasn't meme-worthy enough, and people who are interested in the same kind of information or the same company or the same writing style seem to be leaving the same kind of comments.

To imply that such a thing is nefarious is to totally ignore that every GME and AMC post on WSB has basically the same kind of comments on them as well.  


What I also find odd about the WSB gatekeeping is that they were saying RVP wasn't overnight-success-worthy and that the market cap wasn't quite right.  
Like... what the fuck was GME back in November when that started getting thrown around on WSB? It was basically this... what I'm doing... just some guy who was like ""I like the stock"" and posted his reasons for it and openly said 'it's not going to happen overnight but ya gotta buy and hold.'  


Whatever data anyone collects on me is going to be boring as fuck.  
All I do is swing trade, run, watch soccer, and occasionally talk about space stuff on r/ForAllMankindTV because that show is awesome. If you're looking for a nefarious pumper&dumper, Zack Morris can be found over on twitter or just go back to WSB and pick your nose over there.","['GME', 'AMC']",1

If you dont believe me, look into short selling violations on FINRA, all the documents are public.

Their phones are stagnating, no innovation. They‚Äôre selling based on prestige but even that‚Äôs tapering off significantly and they‚Äôre having a hard time in China. They need to capture China and India if they want to keep the iPhone relevant well into the future.

Their services are mediocre. Apple Music is great but Spotify is still the clear winner in that space, Apple TV (streaming not the box) sucks. Netflix, HBO, Disney, Paramount, Amazon all have a better selection of shows.

MacBook sucks, iPad innovation is ok

Apple Watch is the only real growth prospect the company has right now. Health and well being tech but there‚Äôs really no clear sign Apple is going to completely pivot into this aside from enhanced Apple Watch capabilities.

Apple Store lawsuit with Epic doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôll end well for Apple. At the minimum they‚Äôre not going to get away with keeping the status quo.

I laid out completely how that's not happening in the last half of the post. I've detailed it in multiple comments. I've mentioned videos that detail what is going on with the selling claims. There's literally beyond an abundance of evidence that this is incorrect. 

They're as dedicated to their company as any leadership in the workd and they're still completely engaged in the long run. No one at the top has sold any amount or shares that represents even remotely a significant portion of their ownership. 99% of selling was automated sales done by their lawyers for the taxes on the ownership of their shares as granted by the vested stock options that simply represent their share of the company that they had when it was private then becoming public. 

When you own 5% of a company that goes public and is worth 30 billion dollars the government says you owe taxes on the SHARES that you recieved as they went public. You owe taxes in CASH on the shares. We're talking taxes that are owed on the entire sum of what their shares are worth. So they owe cash for the taxes on the SHARES that are worth billions and they have to pay cash that they don't have. So they do automated selling of shares that works well within the SEC guidelines in order to pay the taxes in CASH that the government says they owe for their shares of the company becoming shares of stock.",[],0

What should really be talked about here is this....
Stocks trade at rough multiples of their revenue, earnings, and cash flow. Its that simple. Increase in these parts of their finances equals increase in stock over medium and long terms.
