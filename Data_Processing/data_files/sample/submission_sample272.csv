I am a college student currently writing my bachelorthesis on hedge fund replication. 

Unfortunately my university does not poses a bloombergterminal so I have to use Reuters. For some reason the Barclay, BofA and Citi bond index families are not included.

I love to code, I think I'm pretty good at it. I do it professionally as well. Algotrading attracted me because of potential upside, maybe working for yourself someday. Because myself like many others here, at the end of day would just like to make some money.

I've realized though, I just don't love learning about markets. I don't love studying charts, it just isn't for me. I like building systems/improving them/ debugging them/watching them work. Unfortunately that is obviously much less valuable as anyone can do it. I remember a relatively heavily upvoted post of a guy (claiming obviously) that too many of us in here just want to code, and don't really want to trade. Not sure who true that is, but I could see that being possible

Those of you who find/found yourself in my shoes, what did you do? Did you focus on other things besides algotrading? Did you focus on particular parts of algotrading? Did you go into building tools? Did you work with other traders? Curious to hear peoples thoughts/ideas",[],1

It seems reasonable me that it would happen on smaller timescales, since there are thousands of trading bots self adjusting to live orders coming in.

However, I would think that it would happen to less of a degree on timescales greater than daily / weekly candles, since orders from individual traders much more easily fly under the radar, aggregated with the day's / week's volume.

4,2021-05-11,n9pacd,algotrading,"Hey guys, I'm a university comp sci student who had the sudden idea to create an automated trading system and was very happy to see that this sub existed for exactly that,

I've already written down the pseudocode for my strategy and all that's left to actually write the damn thing around whichever trading site I decide on. 
I've heard good things about Coinbase given that it has pretty good open source and a wide variety of cryptos to choose from. I've also heard that Coinbase Pro is specifically really good for algotrading

My question has to do with the rates, I've tried looking online but I can't seem to get a straight answer, I can adjust my code to account for fees and I'm hoping that it at least gives profit the majority of the time

What are the rates and fees for Coinbase Pro? After all is said and done how much can I expect to lose each time I buy and sell? 

Let's say I'm starting with $1,000 in my wallet and trading in increments of $250, how much loss do I have to account for? (Percentage and flat fees)

Alternatively, if there are other options that you think are better than Coinbase Pro I'm all ears! I also toyed with the idea of having my own wallet and, if possible, buying and selling crypto without having to deal with third party fees but I've only ever traded through a third party before so I have no idea about the logistics of that but if it's worth it, I'm willing to put in the extra work and learn.

6,2021-05-11,n9sxa5,algotrading,"If the overall market is up, your picks are probably up, and vice versa. There is some variation (including your ""alpha"" whether +ve or -ve) and also randomness, events like earnings etc.

In a crisis, large fund flows dominate the entire market. But it also seems like the market largely moves in tandem on a daily basis, as if the market is constantly repricing macro variables that result in bid/ask prices moving higher or lower ""across the board"", but this kind of seems weird to me outside of short-term financial crises. Why should everything move so closely together? It just seems irrational.

Hoping for a good explanation of why this is the case so I can understand it.

For instance, large institutions might decide to de-risk and sell off large ETF holdings affecting mostly S&P 500 stocks. I guess it then makes sense that all the stocks inside those ETFs might get knocked down a bit. But why should that also affect surrounding stocks, and even stocks in other geographies? If SPX is down 1%, it's likely that Japanese small caps are also going to fall, possibly even by a similar amount. How does this make rational sense?",[],1
7,2021-05-11,n9u82z,algotrading,"Hi all,

I have been searching around for an affordable real time API for stocks prices. The Finhub free API has what I'm looking for (60 calls per minute is OK for me) but it's only for the US markets and I want for international, or at least for Europe.

I am just starting out that's why I'm looking for something affordable at say max 50-100 USD per month. The real time accuracy does not need to be super great, it's enough if it's somewhat accurate on a per minute basis.

I've been searching a lot but I really struggle to find something affordable for Europe that is real time and not with 15 minutes delay etc.

If I can't find any I will consider web scraping, but I would like to avoid it since I want to get prices for many stocks at the same time. I reckon that if I scrape a website for say 60 stocks per minute they will block me or at least limit my connection a lot).

12,2021-05-11,na27ox,algotrading,"I recently built an efficient frontier app that is built on python and hosted on my github. App [here](https://share.streamlit.io/diegodalvarez/streamlit_efficient_frontier/efficient_frontier_streamlit_base.py). 

But sometimes I would run it an get a plot that would look something like this

https://preview.redd.it/lkfv57yutey61.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=a54a0635e1b0c80de79d5a45e6fec964bcd13dc6

I thought it was interesting that I would get this shape with outlier points when I am used to this shape

https://preview.redd.it/5z3ysybwtey61.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba84c2da02893c6805dd1a5b0237dc193af5b71

So I started looking into the problem and my first assumption was the number of tickers. The first test was around 30 stocks and the second test  was 6 stocks. Each used the same calculation method 10y of daily historical adjusted close data using mean returns and covariance with 100,000 simulations. I then built a function in python that drops tickers and then runs the efficient frontier and this is what the results look like. 

https://preview.redd.it/idwa0dmxtey61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=0046bb4a209de931b8aafeb2816ce1e3050d86a7

The way that this function works is that it pulls stocks from S&P 500 and then it drops a random amount of tickers then runs the efficient frontier over and over. It uses 10y of historical  adjusted close prices, mean returns for returns, covariance for risk, and 100,000 simulations. The title of each graph is how many tickers are used. Also the algorithm doesn't redraw after each calculation, it drops from the previous test. 

I ran around 10 test which you can find in my github repo ([here](https://github.com/diegodalvarez/efficient_frontier)). I also kept track of what tickers are used in which test. What I've noticed is that the efficient frontier starts to fit a more ""curvy"" shape as we decrease the numbers of tickers used. Later tests will involve using different groups of stocks separated by industry, risk, and return characteristics. 

I have also added this function to my app above which you can find by selecting the ticker drop function on the left side bar. It does take a long time with 16 efficient frontiers, more than 300 stocks, and 100,000 simulations each so it takes some time. You can also pull the code from my repo and run it in python yourself.

Something that I've also started working on is using anomaly detection to get rid of the outlier points for the minimum-variance and the mean-markowitz portfolio. 

I was also wondering why this shape occurs. If anyone has any ideas that would be great. I'm not sure why with more stocks it looks this way.",[],0

16,2021-05-11,naa633,algotrading,"1. My lesson started from contrasting my calculated EMA values with platform such as TradingView and Webull
2. I was surprised that even large platform gives me ***different value*** of EMA for the same symbol and same window size.
3. For example, symbol **COIN** has EMA10/MA10 = **274.08**/286.53 from Webull, but TradingView gave me **283.77**/286.53. (on 05-07-2021)
4. The EMA10 of COIN between two platform is having delta **-9.69** = 274.08 - 283.77 (**3%** of diff.)
5. Then the question here is which one is correct? and why they are different?
6. (Spoiler) TradingView is correct.
7. (If I jump to the conclusion) Fortunately, the delta **only happens** in the scenario that the symbol does not have long enough of price history and **will not happen** if price history is long enough.

[EMA formula from Wiki](https://preview.redd.it/lkcro5megky61.png?width=286&format=png&auto=webp&s=005b6f674016de3a13344dd5a322befefe962353)

1. The root cause comes from the EMA formula itself. The very first value (S1) of EMA is very critical, since all subsequent EMA values will dependent the first EMA value. (e.g. S2 = Y2\*1/3 + S1\*2/3, when alpha = 1/3)
2. Let‚Äôs call the first value of EMA as **initial value**. The interesting part is there is no a strict way to define what is the initial value. However, the common way in trading is **using the SMA value as the initial value of EMA**. Reference \[2\].
3. Fun fact, If you look into tradingView screen shot, then you would notice the first value of SMA10 and EMA10 are the same.
4. Then how do we calculate correct EMA value? In theory, we should calculate the very first value of the price history and all the way to latest. But, isn‚Äôt it inefficient? Then AAPL has so long history, should I calculate from 1980?
5. The answer is it depends on the window size. As long as we prepare long enough of price history versus the window size, then the EMA value will becomes the same. In an other word, as long as the the overall price history is **X** times larger then the window size, then **the effect of initial value will drop**.
6. I did a small experience using Python, in the case of EMA10, as long as your total price history is larger than 4 times (**X**=4, window=10, price history=40), then the EMA10 value will be the same to the **second decimal.**
7. **Key takeaway**: Be careful when the symbol is just IPO, the EMA value could be different depend on which library you used to calculate. Also **MACD** value might be variant a lot since it is based on EMA12 and EMA26.

An Empirical Assessment""](https://jai.pm-research.com/content/23/2/162) published last fall in the Journal of Alternative Investments.

I am not a finance researcher so I can not speak to the credibility of the journal or the author, but the analysis the author presents for his claims seem credible enough from my layman's perspective (understandable, all models and sources used, etc.).

Main takeaways I had from the paper:

* No significant correlation between cryptocurrencies and other traditional asset classes on returns or volatility. 
   * Only significant correlation was with commodities like gold, on both volatility and risk. 
      * Share common features like a limited supply and their price being driven by aggregate demand and being seen as ""alternatives"" to traditional financial institutions.
* Negative, but not significant, correlation on volatility compared to other assets.
* Significant correlation between trading volume and returns occurring at the same time, as with assets like stock.
* Correlation between lagging returns (returns in the past) and trading volume, hence also future returns.
* Positive and significant correlation between trading volume and volatility (more trading --> more risk), but lagging volatility lead to less trading volume.
* Trading volume effected by both volatility and past returns, but more so the latter.
* Trading activity not significantly correlated with macroeconomic indicators.

**If you can create a backtest to setup an algorithm for a bot to trade off of, can't there also just be a bot that auto backtests every variable on every currency that's available to you to, to generate the best possible trading algorithm on every currency(for the time it was created) without spending hours on 100's or 1,000's of backtests? Sure that is a large amount of data processing, but I'd assume the ends would justify the means.**

I have a strategy that I am running on the 1 min or 5 min interval.  It is getting eaten alive by slippage.  Right now it places market orders.  I am working on optimizing which trades to let go in order to minimize slippage.  I believe this will create a profitable algo, but it is leaving a lot of money on the table (80% reduction in profit due to slippage, which is better than the 120% I was getting before).  Just to illustrate, this strategy can return 10% daily if slippage were not a factor, but loses money in production.  I think I can get it to a couple percent return daily by being more selective on which trades to take (going to test this tomorrow).

If I were to move to limit orders, my fear is that on the best trades I won't get filled and on the worst ones I will, so ultimately I will be worse off.

I was looking into strategies to sell covered calls on some of my shares, and was basically wondering what ideal threshold for otm calls (always selling at 1.5 times the current price for example) to maximize the premiums collected and limit the number of times where my shares get called. Did some python and matplotlib to investiguate and i wanted to share with you.

Obviously the further away from the price the safer it is (first graph), but then I simulated spreading out contacts between two thresholds (sell calls from 1.2 to 1.5 times the price) and how effective that would be (graph 2). As you can see in the second graph, risk gets used with an acceptable loss in premiums, so I can prefer such a scenario.

161,2021-05-18,nf0hbd,algotrading,"I have always been curious about game theory, but have been to intimidated to try to learn it. This week, I have decided to try and shake my fear and begin to learn about some basic principles in game theory:

I am looking at this basic problem in game theory that asks how should the owner of a company split the profits between her and her workers:

https://imgur.com/a/aDa5jiE

I am having some difficulty in understanding the notations:

1) "" Formally, a coalitional game is defined as: There is a set N (of n players) and a function and a function v that maps subsets of players to the real numbers: v : 2^N -> R , where v(""empty set"") = 0""

a ) Why does "" v : 2^N ""? Is the point of this expression to show all the possible interactions that can exist between any groups of players? 

b) When considering the ""value function"" (i.e. ""v"") , why does v (""empty set"") = 0? I guess this is an obvious statement, but is it supposed to mean that the potential value of the interaction between ""no players"" (i.e. the empty set) is ""0""?

2) Now, the problem where the owner of a company split the profits between her and her workers:

- The owner is represented by the symbol ""o""
- There are ""m"" number of workers (w1, w2, w3 ... wm)
- Each worker contributes an amount ""p"" to the profit

I am having difficulty understanding how the ""value function"" for this problem is determined:

The value function for the coalition of players (the coalition is denoted by ""S"") is:

- v(S) = mp, if the owner is included in the coalition 
- v(S) = 0, if the owner is not included in the coalition 

My question: How are v(S) = mp and v(S) = 0 initially determined? Or are these values assumed?

3) In this question, ""m"" is defined both as ""the number of workers"" as well as the cardinality of : S / {o} .

I have generally heard ""cardinality"" referred to as the ""size of a set"". What exactly does cardinality mean in this question? Are you supposed to be able to compute "" S / {o} ""? Why does ""S / {o}"" = m?

4) Can someone please walk me through the calculations? Why according to the Shapley values, should the profit be distributed such that: the owner receive ""mp/2"" and each worker receive ""p/2""? 

5) Lastly : Why is this question important? Is the point of this question to show ""the fairest distribution of profits according to contributions""?

Thanks

211,2021-05-18,nf8sdj,algotrading,"Im 4k LOC and 60h deep into writing C/C++ bot with some ML for trading pairs. It is pretty fast and can make decisions 100 times a sec or even faster. The idea was to trade on intervals of 0.1-30 sec.

So far I had little success because of high fees and low price volatility. The main problem is that if I hold some asset for more than 30 seconds it becomes unreasonable because the bot itself cant see that far into the future. 

I know that HFT is a thing but in my case its about 250ms latency so its not that.

So before I spend another 60hours on this, since I have little experience in finance I want to know: does trading high volatility stocks make sense on intervals 30sec or less, or the profit will not cover transaction fees and Im better off developing longer period strategies?

So far I did binance using real time orderbook data, 0.01% fees, +0.02% take profit and -0.1% stop loss. At best it went from 10k to 10k+8$ in a few minutes and then bought DOGECOIN and went to 10k-50$. Average scenario it looses about 1-2$ a minute (OMEGALUL). I can see some ways of improving it but I feel like Im trying to achieve smth which is not feasible without collocation and other serious HFT stuff.

https://www.quant-investing.com/blogs/general/2015/02/16/truths-about-stop-losses-that-nobody-wants-to-believe

This article suggests that a 20% stop loss is best to use, because the 5, 10, etc stop you out too soon. Lower stop-losses tend to offset and major losses in a short period, but over a long term they are wildly less profitable. I was curious if anyone else had found the same?

Here's my backtests:

Over 1,200 trades a 10% stop-loss would net me a 1.35% return (per 100% of my account traded).

Over the same 1,500 trades a 20% stop-loss would net me a 2.3% return (per 100% of my account traded).

Now, I'm not suggesting that 1,500 trades is a good back test. I would probably aim for a number closer to 10,000. However, the article tested this method over 85 years! However, just using my specific test as an example, I was very surprised to find such a wild difference in profit. I was curious if anyone else has had similar results? If so, why do you think this is?

Note: I only throw about 10% of my account at any single trade. So if a 20% stop loss did occur, it would be a 2% hit on my overall account which aligns with the following article:

421,2021-05-18,nfgage,algotrading,"Hello everyone. I'm a programmer with about 15 years of experience and I've already written an application in C# that scrapes stocks and automatically places orders through an API. This all works well. The issue I'm experiencing is that I'm trying to make an intelligent machine that will make the decision to Buy, Sell, or Hold on every 1 second interval.

I've done a loooooot of research into ML the past three months and I'm currently using Google's Tensorflow to try and create an Agent that can do this. I'm having varying degrees of success

My first model was a modified DQN ( [https://github.com/benjamin-dupuis/DQN-snake](https://github.com/benjamin-dupuis/DQN-snake)) It was kind of close, but I just couldn't get a reliable sell to occur. It buys, and holds well, but the sell is unreliable.

I then discovered the Multi Armed Bandit model ([https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/bandits\_tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/bandits_tutorial)) and that sounded a little bit closer. I used some of Googles samples to build an MAB using a couple of different types: Linear Stochastic and a Drifting Stochastic. Neither worked quite as well as I hoped either.

Has anyone had good experience with autotrading using a specific DQN or MAB model? I'm wondering if I'm expecting too much from machine learning...  

My features are AskPrice, BidePrice, Delta (change in Ask Price over last reading), IsInvested (1 or 0), Profit ( -1 if invested, else ranges from -1 to 1).  

I'm using both positive and negative rewards. It seems I get the most variance in my results when adjusting reward patterns.

600,2021-05-11,na27ox,algotrading,"I recently built an efficient frontier app that is built on python and hosted on my github. App [here](https://share.streamlit.io/diegodalvarez/streamlit_efficient_frontier/efficient_frontier_streamlit_base.py). 

But sometimes I would run it an get a plot that would look something like this

I thought it was interesting that I would get this shape with outlier points when I am used to this shape

So I started looking into the problem and my first assumption was the number of tickers. The first test was around 30 stocks and the second test  was 6 stocks. Each used the same calculation method 10y of daily historical adjusted close data using mean returns and covariance with 100,000 simulations. I then built a function in python that drops tickers and then runs the efficient frontier and this is what the results look like. 

https://preview.redd.it/idwa0dmxtey61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=0046bb4a209de931b8aafeb2816ce1e3050d86a7

The way that this function works is that it pulls stocks from S&P 500 and then it drops a random amount of tickers then runs the efficient frontier over and over. It uses 10y of historical  adjusted close prices, mean returns for returns, covariance for risk, and 100,000 simulations. The title of each graph is how many tickers are used. Also the algorithm doesn't redraw after each calculation, it drops from the previous test. 

I ran around 10 test which you can find in my github repo ([here](https://github.com/diegodalvarez/efficient_frontier)). I also kept track of what tickers are used in which test. What I've noticed is that the efficient frontier starts to fit a more ""curvy"" shape as we decrease the numbers of tickers used. Later tests will involve using different groups of stocks separated by industry, risk, and return characteristics. 

I have also added this function to my app above which you can find by selecting the ticker drop function on the left side bar. It does take a long time with 16 efficient frontiers, more than 300 stocks, and 100,000 simulations each so it takes some time. You can also pull the code from my repo and run it in python yourself.

Something that I've also started working on is using anomaly detection to get rid of the outlier points for the minimum-variance and the mean-markowitz portfolio. 

I was also wondering why this shape occurs. If anyone has any ideas that would be great. I'm not sure why with more stocks it looks this way.",[],0

TD Ameritrade's API is very popular for those of us that are interested in trying to build their own trading tools. The TDA API is also nice in that it supports option trading and is a good source of data for current option chains. However, the method used, get\_options\_chain, returns a JSON object that has a pretty complicated structure. It's a nested dictionary that mixes dicts and lists, where (at least) one of the lists has a single member that is a dict (at least that is how Python views it). 

I really struggled to try deal with it, and the only way I found to completely decompose it to (key, value) pairs is to use recursion. To save others the pain I went through, I created a GitHub repo with a couple of examples that will:

* Print out on your console every key/value pair in the get\_options\_chain JSON object
* Write the retrieved JSON object to a JSON file on your local machine.

It's currently generating income for me and my partner and neither of us work for hedge funds or any investment funds, mostly just part time work accumulating over a few years. We started with promising manual strategies and added more automations as we went along.

This algorithm monitors a few thousand symbols, mostly US and CA stocks and executes anywhere between 1-30+ trades per day, almost every day but with more activity around quarterly reporting.

The strategy to generate the signals uses a few ML models trained on historical data over the past few years, on data extracted from Thompson Reuters, as well as on our own proprietary formulas (in total, a few hundred features we deem most important are used in training).

For trade execution, we wrote our own software in .NET interfacing with IBKR. Machine learning is almost all Python.

For backtesting, we use QuantConnect as well as some in-house built software. This is mostly to try optimize certain parameters (entry/exit times, allocations, ...).

810,2021-05-20,ngr5jq,algotrading,"Hi everyone,

for a grad level Machine Learning Class I recently completed, I built a decision tree to predict whether  a stock from the 30 companies in the DOW would return 0.5% or more by end of a week using the previous 6 weeks of data.

Our data was limited to the 2011 Q1 and Q2 Dataset, and just included Weekly stock price, volume, days to dividend, and % dividend. we trained on Q1 and tested on Q2.  We found our tree performed best using an RSI indicator, MACD indicator, Previous Week Price Change, previous 6 Week price change, days to dividend, and % dividend return.

Moving forward, despite overfitting with too many parameters being a constant theme that people warn about (with good reason I'm sure), I'd like to try building some huge trees/neural networks using just about as many attributes as possible and then start eliminating those that seem to do more harm than good.

Like before I will be choosing from the DOW, but I'll be incorporating other factors.  Previously my only live Algotrading has been with crypto, and frankly has been very frustrating.  I've learned how TA indicators really are just a little better than a coinflip, and there are much fewer attributes to incorporate with Cryptos as opposed to an actual stock in a company.  Hence why I'd like to try incorporating as many attributes as possible since I've felt really limited to just TA indicators with crypto trading.  

I've listed all the parameters I want to start pulling data for below, but please add any that I have not thought of.  Please feel free to give any advice on how to best apply these indicators (eg, how long of a moving average should I use for tracking Number of Mentions in Social Media? 2 days? Hourly? Weekly?....)  Also feel free to point out if any of my suggested attributes are particularly important or totally useless.  Thanks so much for any insight! It will save me countless hours working with data that winds up being completely useless

&#x200B;

Currently, the list of params I think I would be useful and want to incorporate:

1) Use of 2-3 Technical Indicators at Most 

 \-> This is probably my biggest concern.  From what I've read on here, using multiple TA to make a tree  or neural network is essentially just mutating the same data over and over again, which doesn't produce distinctly different attributes that will improve prediction accuracy

\->That being said, I would think 2-3 TA indicators can help establish a positive market trend , and define whether the trend is long or short term (eg 2 week avg is above 200 day avg, and a positive MACD, I would consider a valuable set of attributes that Stock is Bullish). 

2) P/E Ratio.  This an obvious useful tool for company fundamentals.  

3) Related Raw Materials Costs (e.g. my neighbor works at a Brewing Company and mentioned how high aluminum costs and no bars pouring drafts means more canning, which has been cutting into profits despite record sales)

4) Overall Market Trend (is DOW/S&P bearish or bullish)

5) Relationship to Similar Companies (e.g. is Coke lagging behind Pepsi? Do we expect Coke to Rise or Pepsi to Crash, or both?)

6) Scan internet for major News Outlet Mentions (e.g. Did Jim Cramer recommend on his show?)

7)  Sentiment Analysis and Popularity Growth from Reddit,Twitter (is it increasing or decreasing? Is sentiment mostly positive?)

8) VIX to incorporate risk due to volatility, help define higher/lower bail thresholds

9) Strike Prices and Expirations Dates of Puts/Calls (essentially applying the Max Pain strategy where major Hedge Funds that sell options try to manipulate prices to not go above/below a certain range to ensure the vast majority of options expire worthless.)

10) Depth Charts to view major sell/buy walls

11) Days to Dividend, % Dividend Return

&#x200B;

\*As  a side note, I wanted to mention that I've found Volume to be completely useless attribute, but perhaps I'm not using it right.  Even if I'm able to see if most of the buying is Maker side (which is not always available info), I already can tell because the price is increasing, as one would expect.  The price and Buy Volume I've found are essentially just the same data, if buy volume increases, price increases proportionally.  The only strat I've heard that uses volume that sort of makes sense is that big money Firms tend to increase volume substantially, while keeping price as unchanged as possible, and eventually reduce supply until price eventually does jump.  Other than that, I've yet to find a way to use volume effectively, but please let me know if I'm completely missing something here.

I realize there is a separate TradeIdeas forum, but the activity there is low. So posting it here, hoping for some inputs -

* Can TradeStation be used to execute orders based on a custom built scanner?
* How versatile can the rule setting be?
* What can EasyLanguage be used for - Build scanners, backtesting, order management?
* Would  it be possible to send a bracket order (Limit buy/sell/stoploss) and  then after 10cents profit have an automatic trailing stop trigger and  remove the initial stop loss?
* Can  you build a scanner that scans the whole market for stocks with certain  parameters and then set up an automatic trade set-up to trade those  stocks based on a set strategy?
* Can you backtest only on single stocks or backtest on past scanner results?

Thank you in advance for your inputs.",[],1

828,2021-05-13,nbdan8,algotrading,"I'll preface by saying this is half hypothetical, as the strategy is still bring refined and I'm trying to improve it, but I'm just going to talk as if I have already fully made it because easier I guess.

So lets say I have a winning strategy, but it's a borderline HFT strategy if that makes sense. I have back tested and tested it live, accounted for commissions and spreads and all. And yes, I have asked myself why has no one else done this if this strategy is so good? And I have a reasonable answer I wont share because I would rather not give away the strategy.

The issue is it won't work well with a low amount of capital and this strategy is most profitable with millions of pounds or dollars being used. I dont have much capital at all because I'm a student so I can't really employ this strategy myself.

So I thought okay, I could sell it to a hedgefund who trade algorthmically. I dont know how to do that though. I'm based in London so I would ideally sell it to a hedgefund here.

How would I find a hedgefund to sell it to? And more importantly how do I decide on a price for the algo? Let's say it makes 1% a day (literally just a random number), how do I decide it's worth?

Also is it worth pursuing a masters or PhD in what I'm studying (mathematics and physics) to gain more credibility before I sell it?",[],0

Am I totally off-base to ASSUME that my max total system drawdown COULD be if all the pairs hit MAX drawdown at the same time (unlikely but to be safe?)  Therefore I can reduce my entry sizing in the higher drawdown pairs to keep it to something more reasonable?

Current systems I think are needed

An Empirical Assessment""](https://jai.pm-research.com/content/23/2/162) published last fall in the Journal of Alternative Investments.

I am not a finance researcher so I can not speak to the credibility of the journal or the author, but the analysis the author presents for his claims seem credible enough from my layman's perspective (understandable, all models and sources used, etc.).

Main takeaways I had from the paper:

* No significant correlation between cryptocurrencies and other traditional asset classes on returns or volatility. 
   * Only significant correlation was with commodities like gold, on both volatility and risk. 
      * Share common features like a limited supply and their price being driven by aggregate demand and being seen as ""alternatives"" to traditional financial institutions.
* Negative, but not significant, correlation on volatility compared to other assets.
* Significant correlation between trading volume and returns occurring at the same time, as with assets like stock.
* Correlation between lagging returns (returns in the past) and trading volume, hence also future returns.
* Positive and significant correlation between trading volume and volatility (more trading --> more risk), but lagging volatility lead to less trading volume.
* Trading volume effected by both volatility and past returns, but more so the latter.
* Trading activity not significantly correlated with macroeconomic indicators.

Obviously you can backtest whatever currency you want on whatever chart period you want with whichever timeframe/indicators you want. BUT I've done about 60 backtests in the last two hours just tweaking small things to get the best results and it got me thinking:

**If you can create a backtest to setup an algorithm for a bot to trade off of, can't there also just be a bot that auto backtests every variable on every currency that's available to you to, to generate the best possible trading algorithm on every currency(for the time it was created) without spending hours on 100's or 1,000's of backtests? Sure that is a large amount of data processing, but I'd assume the ends would justify the means.**

I have a strategy that I am running on the 1 min or 5 min interval.  It is getting eaten alive by slippage.  Right now it places market orders.  I am working on optimizing which trades to let go in order to minimize slippage.  I believe this will create a profitable algo, but it is leaving a lot of money on the table (80% reduction in profit due to slippage, which is better than the 120% I was getting before).  Just to illustrate, this strategy can return 10% daily if slippage were not a factor, but loses money in production.  I think I can get it to a couple percent return daily by being more selective on which trades to take (going to test this tomorrow).

If I were to move to limit orders, my fear is that on the best trades I won't get filled and on the worst ones I will, so ultimately I will be worse off.

As the moment, backtesting it.....it seems pretty impressive.

873,2021-05-16,ne0501,algotrading,"Hey guys,

I was looking into strategies to sell covered calls on some of my shares, and was basically wondering what ideal threshold for otm calls (always selling at 1.5 times the current price for example) to maximize the premiums collected and limit the number of times where my shares get called. Did some python and matplotlib to investiguate and i wanted to share with you.

Obviously the further away from the price the safer it is (first graph), but then I simulated spreading out contacts between two thresholds (sell calls from 1.2 to 1.5 times the price) and how effective that would be (graph 2). As you can see in the second graph, risk gets used with an acceptable loss in premiums, so I can prefer such a scenario.

I pretty much found that for $PLTR the best historic threshold is around 1.3 (you get all the shares called for at the spike that happened in february, but otherwise pretty safe) and spreading from 1.2 to 1.4 can achieve similar outcomes.

I have already studied an elementary econometric course covering regression, multiple regression, binary, logit and probit etc, etc. In the next year or so I will  have the option to choose some more intermediate level to advanced econometric courses. I'm just wondering how applicable the models ill learn in econometrics are to issues outside the social science spectrum? That is, the application of econometric models to data for purposes of non-formal analysis, maybe even call it ""recreational analysis"". For example, i know that certain models when meeting certain conditions, can be applied to social science type issues/experiments, but what if i wanted to try leverage econometric modelling to perform analysis on more niche things such as sports (like is presented in moneyball for example) or even other games such as card games or stocks(though i know econometrics is already prevalent here).  I love finance and have an avid interest in statistics, stata and other programming languages, and want to deepen my statistical modelling capacity  beyond that of regressions, etc. I am really considering chasing this pathway, however, i am worried that the absence of applicability to anything outside of social science type experiments , in addition to a high focus on theoretical content over practical implementation will lead to growing boredom of the subject if i were to study it.  Hence, why i ask whether what i learn can be to at least some extent applied to recreational type ""experiments"", where my knowledge feels more tangible as i can actively apply what i have learnt to things that can be analysed with statistics and that are of interest to me, outside on my studies of course.",[],1

I am looking at this basic problem in game theory that asks how should the owner of a company split the profits between her and her workers:

https://imgur.com/a/aDa5jiE

I am having some difficulty in understanding the notations:

1) "" Formally, a coalitional game is defined as: There is a set N (of n players) and a function and a function v that maps subsets of players to the real numbers: v : 2^N -> R , where v(""empty set"") = 0""

a ) Why does "" v : 2^N ""? Is the point of this expression to show all the possible interactions that can exist between any groups of players? 

b) When considering the ""value function"" (i.e. ""v"") , why does v (""empty set"") = 0? I guess this is an obvious statement, but is it supposed to mean that the potential value of the interaction between ""no players"" (i.e. the empty set) is ""0""?

2) Now, the problem where the owner of a company split the profits between her and her workers:

- The owner is represented by the symbol ""o""
- There are ""m"" number of workers (w1, w2, w3 ... wm)
- Each worker contributes an amount ""p"" to the profit

I am having difficulty understanding how the ""value function"" for this problem is determined:

The value function for the coalition of players (the coalition is denoted by ""S"") is:

- v(S) = mp, if the owner is included in the coalition 
- v(S) = 0, if the owner is not included in the coalition 

My question: How are v(S) = mp and v(S) = 0 initially determined? Or are these values assumed?

3) In this question, ""m"" is defined both as ""the number of workers"" as well as the cardinality of : S / {o} .

I have generally heard ""cardinality"" referred to as the ""size of a set"". What exactly does cardinality mean in this question? Are you supposed to be able to compute "" S / {o} ""? Why does ""S / {o}"" = m?

4) Can someone please walk me through the calculations? Why according to the Shapley values, should the profit be distributed such that: the owner receive ""mp/2"" and each worker receive ""p/2""? 

5) Lastly : Why is this question important? Is the point of this question to show ""the fairest distribution of profits according to contributions""?

Thanks

So far I had little success because of high fees and low price volatility. The main problem is that if I hold some asset for more than 30 seconds it becomes unreasonable because the bot itself cant see that far into the future.

I know that HFT is a thing but in my case its about 250ms latency so its not that.

So before I spend another 60hours on this, since I have little experience in finance I want to know: does trading high volatility stocks make sense on intervals 30sec or less, or the profit will not cover transaction fees and Im better off developing longer period strategies?

So far I did binance using real time orderbook data, 0.01% fees, +0.02% take profit and -0.1% stop loss.

893,2021-05-18,nfgage,algotrading,"Hello everyone. I'm a programmer with about 15 years of experience and I've already written an application in C# that scrapes stocks and automatically places orders through an API. This all works well. The issue I'm experiencing is that I'm trying to make an intelligent machine that will make the decision to Buy, Sell, or Hold on every 1 second interval.

I've done a loooooot of research into ML the past three months and I'm currently using Google's Tensorflow to try and create an Agent that can do this. I'm having varying degrees of success

My first model was a modified DQN ( [https://github.com/benjamin-dupuis/DQN-snake](https://github.com/benjamin-dupuis/DQN-snake)) It was kind of close, but I just couldn't get a reliable sell to occur. It buys, and holds well, but the sell is unreliable.

I then discovered the Multi Armed Bandit model ([https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/bandits\_tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/bandits_tutorial)) and that sounded a little bit closer. I used some of Googles samples to build an MAB using a couple of different types: Linear Stochastic and a Drifting Stochastic. Neither worked quite as well as I hoped either.

Has anyone had good experience with autotrading using a specific DQN or MAB model? I'm wondering if I'm expecting too much from machine learning...  

My features are AskPrice, BidePrice, Delta (change in Ask Price over last reading), IsInvested (1 or 0), Profit ( -1 if invested, else ranges from -1 to 1).  

I'm using both positive and negative rewards. It seems I get the most variance in my results when adjusting reward patterns.

Thanks for taking the time to get this far =)   Any thoughts?",[],1

895,2021-05-18,nfkgfs,algotrading,"Through both backtesting, as well a few articles I've read here's one: 

https://www.quant-investing.com/blogs/general/2015/02/16/truths-about-stop-losses-that-nobody-wants-to-believe

This article suggests that a 20% stop loss is best to use, because the 5, 10, etc stop you out too soon. Lower stop-losses tend to offset and major losses in a short period, but over a long term they are wildly less profitable. I was curious if anyone else had found the same?

Here's my backtests:

Over 1,500 trades a 10% stop-loss would net me a 1.35% return (per 100% of my account traded).

Over the same 1,500 trades a 20% stop-loss would net me a 2.3% return (per 100% of my account traded).

Now, I'm not suggesting that 1,500 trades is a good back test. I would probably aim for a number closer to 10,000. However, the article tested this method over 85 years! Using my specific test as an example, I was very surprised to find such a wild difference in profit. I was curious if anyone else has had similar results? If so, why do you think this is?


Note: I only throw about 10% of my account at any single trade. So if a 20% stop loss did occur, it would be a 2% hit on my overall account which aligns with the following article:

I am currently working on a DCA strategy which is working pretty good so far in backtests. But, I want to add some more complexity to it. 

Right now, I have profitable independent strategies for pair X/Y, X/Z and Y/Z.  What I am looking for, is to keep running the strategies on pair X/Y and X/Z, but somehow also run Y/Z at the same time and use those profits to scale the first two pairs.

905,2021-05-19,ngbjiy,algotrading,"TD Ameritrade's API is very popular for those of us that are interested in trying to build their own trading tools. The TDA API is also nice in that it supports option trading and is a good source of data for current option chains. However, the method used, get\_options\_chain, returns a JSON object that has a pretty complicated structure. It's a nested dictionary that mixes dicts and lists, where (at least) one of the lists has a single member that is a dict (at least that is how Python views it).

I really struggled to deal with it, and the only way I found to completely decompose it to (key, value) pairs was to use recursion. To save others the pain I went through, I created a GitHub repo with a couple of examples that will:

* Print out on your console every key/value pair in the get\_options\_chain JSON object
* Write the retrieved JSON object to a JSON file on your local machine.

910,2021-05-19,ngfjqg,algotrading,"Hi algotraders, spent a long time developing a working strategy which can be used live, thought I'd share some live results with you all. It's currently generating income for me and my partners and neither of us work for hedge funds or anything, mostly just part time work accumulating over a few years. We started with promising manual strategies and added more automation as we went along.

This algorithm monitors a few thousand symbols, mostly US and CA stocks and executes anywhere between 1-30 trades per day, almost every day but with more activity around quarterly reporting.

The strategy to generate the signals uses a few ML models trained on historical data over the past few years on data extracted from Thompson Reuters, as well as on our own proprietary formulas (in total, a few hundred features we deem most important are used in training).

For trade execution, we wrote our own software in .NET interfacing with IBKR. Machine learning is almost all Python.

For backtesting, we use QuantConnect as well as some in-house built software. This is mostly to try optimize certain parameters (entry/exit times, allocations, ...).

Here are the results from my actual IBKR account so far this year:

Basically I was frustrated how shitty the sec‚Äôs api is and how there is no defined format for a lot of forms which makes it very difficult to algorithmically use the data.

This project was quit tough but I managed to make it work. It checks for latest sec filings and parses certain forms and then sends a message to my other bot through a websocket. It is at a point where it serves my needs and I could stop developing it further.

On the other hand, I could see potential in this being expanded in a full fledged api to query parsed sec filings and connect to a WS to include qualitative live data about recent filings.

I‚Äôm curious to hear if you guys would find value in such an api mentioned above. If so, I‚Äôd be happy to further develop it and make it publicly accessible.
