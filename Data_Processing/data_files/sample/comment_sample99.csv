Bonus thing is that there is major movement to stop huawei's western expansion. Very bullish for long term investment in nokia imho. (I have 1871 shares).""

Also nokia offers fastest inhouse switch fabric (FP4) and competitors have nothing to compete against that. Nokia is gaining market share from cisco etc. Because of this chip.

When supply catches up to demand (which isn't happening for another year at least), their sheets will still look great because they'll start chipping away at Intel and Nvidias market share. With the Xilinx merger they'll become the largest customer at TSMC. As they start transitioning to 5 nm, they'll be able to allocate 7nm to lower margin GPU products, a segment which is currently neglected due to shortages, both by Nvidia and AMD.

Besides that, they just announced a $4b share buyback. AMD have never had this kind of free cash before. This is going to prevent any sub $70 targets, unless there's a very sudden macro cause, and even then they'll eat it up because they want to buy the shares at a decent price. The reason they're doing share buybacks and not investing in the company? They have no factories, so they don't need capital to increase production levels. They've already effectively maxed out on R&D, and as Intel have proven over the last 4 years, you can't throw extra money at semiconductor R&D to get better results.

Their product roadmap for the next 5 years is amazing and they have a proven track record of delivering.

They said themselves that their gpu lineup should get another 50%+ per/watt improvement next gen, and leakers who have been pretty reliable previously are pointing to much higher numbers.

In the CPU space, Intel's next two generations are no threat whatsoever, and AMDs iterative design approach means consistent gains in performance and power consumption every year. Intel's 10nm laptop CPUs can increase their performance by 10% for a 50% power consumption tradeoff. It proves how bad the state of their foundries really is.

The Xilinx merger is a big brain play if it goes through, which it should. It gives them the FPGAs necessary to chip away at Nvidias monopoly on machine learning. Xilinx already easily outperforms Nvidia here, but Nvidia has an ecosystem that needs to be broken. As we move towards smaller processing nodes, transistor size reductions will no longer be the way to get better performance. A mix of FPGAs, ASICs, and general compute units is the future. That's what AMD have recognised and why they're building an arsenal of integrated CPU and GPU products now. They're building the experience required to meet the demands of the future.

I don't have much money so I've got 265 shares via CFDs on 5x leverage. Assuming the Xilinx merger is successful, $100-130 EOY is easily manageable imo. It will likely take a hit after the merger as Xilinx owners sell their converted shares, but that's to be expected. With the guidance AMD have for this year it's also plausible they may increase the buyback program depending on demand/shortages, which could alleviate Xilinx sellers.",[],0

2287,gyz1bb0,2021-05-21,t1_gyyd6u8,wallstreetbets,"Yes, just make sure you stop buying and selling it 30 days before the tax year changes over.  

Hypothetical example:

March 1- Buy 10 shares of XYZ for $100 = $1000
March 15 - Sell 10 shares of XYZ for $50 = -$500 loss.  
March 25 - Buy 10 shares of XYZ again  for $100 = $1000 + 500 (from -$5000 carried losses) = $1500 total cost basis.  

Now let's say you sell 10 shares at $13 on March 31.  

March 31 - Sell 10 shares of XYZ for $13 = $1300.  DO I OWE TAXES ON $1300?? 
Total cost basis from carried forward losses = $1500.  

$1300 - 1500 = -$200 in total losses = no taxes

The catch is that total cost basis will ONLY kick in if you wait 30 days after that last sale on March 31.  So on May 1st, you won't owe taxes as long as you never buy XYZ again throughout April.  

People get screwed because they do this toward the end of the year. Switch out the March example above for Nov. People trade all through Nov and keep doing it in Dec and then it's too late to wait 30 days for the wash sale rule. If your total cost basis doesn't kick, you could owe taxes on gains you don't really have, and it could be huge.  Just take the month off starting Dec 1st if you don't want to worry about anything.",[],0

I don't claim to be familiar with the math so going from a very simplistic approach. I think the basic physics are what they are even if you lack the math knowledge to measure it.

Here is some data I could pull from the SF250 which may shed more light on this.

A typical trophy truck would have completed that 40 mile stretch in 35-60 minutes (I think about 50-70 mph). They put out around 850-900 hp (maybe more).

Kyle Seggelin, took an off-road 4 runner and swapped a Nissan Leaf motor in (which puts out about 107 hp) and using an otherwise typical off-road truck setup averaged about 20 mph on that 40 mile section (took about 2 hours).

The Endurance supposedly puts out about 600 hp using the all wheel drive. It completed that 40 mile stretch in about 2 hours at an average speed of 20 mph.

We can speculate all we want, but the fact is, that regardless of their miscalculation of the energy usage, the Endurance with its 600 hp averaged the same speed over the 40 miles as the modified 4 runner with 107 hp. Neither is close to the top speeds. For the 4 runner, well it simply lacked an engine with sufficient power, but for the endurance either the guy driving was an idiot or there was something about the way the truck is built that prevented it from going faster (heck, it went the same speed as a truck with a lawnmower engine). I am going to stick with what seems to make sense to me that it was primarily due to issues with unsprung weight (as the performance aligns with that expectation).

I agree this is speculation on my part (as to unsrprung weight being the culprit) and I agree that the SF250 is mostly irrelevant for anyone buying a truck, but the concerns about unsprung weight are what they are and they have not yet shown a vehicle that performs properly.",[],0

1) to have a STANDARD of LIVING you have to have WORK. 

2) If you can't compete with the next country (especially in wages) and you buy your shit off them instead of MAKNG it for yourselves, then pretty soon you have no MONEY to buy shit, because your country aint making anything so you have no job, & nowhere to work to earn wages unless you EMIGRATE . Get it? <duh?>

Why pay an American to make phones or underwear or TVs or garden chairs, or games, or lawnmowers or music centers, or computers, or underwear, or clothes or whatever-the-fuck, when you can get an Asian to do ity in an Asian factory. So you end up that America has no factories and nobody working in them.

3) So THEY (foreign industry)  have your money AND  your jobs and THEY make the shit YOU USE .. and you OWE them your country. 

Trump had the idea of putting tarrifss on imports - but he didnt seem to understand that he was not fining the Chinese, he was just making Chinese goods more expensive in teh USA.. the American consumer pays that extra, and if you dont have a CHOICE where you buy your shit, if it is not MADE in the USA, then you pay extra or you go without. Like - NO ONE in the whole USA makes phones... get it? Noty even effing telephones .. **zero** Made in america in the whole continent.

Why do you think the USA owes (right now) a sum equivalent to  **100% of it's yearky GDP** in overseas debt?.. AND does not ever try to pay of ANY of it (hasn-t paid off ANY for decades) - AND only pays SOME of the yearly interest on top of that.. so the total sum keeps building up ..hmm?  Reached 100% GDP end of last year

I aint talking about radicals or communism or good or bad, wtf? this is NOT some moral crusade, dothat for yourself. 

 .. I'm just talking about **economics** and not being STUPID.

 Ask your bank manager - you're now **100% in debt** to that bank for your **whole** yearly income, and you can't pay the interest.  
So you want to give him IOU's for the interest,  AND ALSO take out another loan on TOP of your 100% income you already owe (and cant pay), and offer him more IOU's?

THATS going to work, aint it?  = Try it.

Predator: man vs monster, but it's a team of highly trained humans vs a highly trained monster. I place it in the ""monster action movie"" sub genre.

Alien: also a man/woman vs monster, but the situation is so different, and I dont mean space vs jungle. Alien is a group of ""everyday blue collar"" individuals stuck on a space ship with limited supplies and no where near the same combat skills as the elite soldiers in predator. They had to figure out a solution to their monster problem that wasnt just, ""lets do what were best at: kill"". I put this in the ""horror/survival monster movie"" sub genre.

That way, I can legitimately say they're both my favorite movies for their ""sub genres"". Both amazing movies.

Yesterday I decided to try options for the first time (see my previous post) and I used BNGO. Then today I had an idea. I have about $2,680 invested in 121 QYLD dividend stocks which pays roughly $28 a month. But I had an idea because I have serious brain damage. What if I take that money, plus $200 of the $396 premium I got from my first option play, and buy 500 shares of BNGO. Then what if I sell some covered calls expiring on June 18 with a $6 SP. I'll get roughly $255 premium which is more than the $28 I likely would have gotten from QYLD in June. And if BNGO reaches $6 on ED, I'll profit more in addition to the $255. If I bought 500 right now at $5.61, I'd roughly profit $440 total, which includes the premium, when I sell for $3000. This is my dividend stock money so I don't mind if I have to sell since I don't want this to be in bngo long-term, I have other shares for that. But I know there's a huge risk of BNGO actually dropping below my intial buy price as well as QYLD rising higher by mid June, causing me to not being able to at least by 121 shares again, which would reduce the potential monthly dividend. Idk what do you think about this play. Smart for the intial short term or completely brain damaged?",[],0

At $65k/yr/patient in revenue they will need about 3000 patients to break even by then. In Q1 they were able to get 250 new patient signups, if they get 250 new patients each quarter and those patients use the drug for 3 years (FDA approval guidance was for 1 year!) they will NEVER make $50mm/qtr.

Cheapest: ok, I should've said cheapest *European* broker as other brokers like Etoro and Webull are also active in EU, but they're not European.
Why does it matter (to me)? In Europe many countries have a *""transaction tax""* every time you B or S. Degiro (I don't know all of them) will collect that tax on my behalf and pay it to the taxman, so I don't have to do it.

It's following tech, more specifically, Tesla.

I've you've seen my comments Ive shorted Tesla before and might jump back in late next week depending on what the 8 ball says. 

This means I'm effectively hedging my own gains...

After the may event not really turning heads, and I've not read anything about it yet, I think it might rise but collapse with other stocks too. Growth stocks don't look good for a potential market crash next month.

You may also want to go look up what a factoid actually is before you keep using the term.

And I'm thinking it's less an issue of the quote being stupid and moreso that you can't understand it. It's often cited for a reason, and that reason isn't because you're actually just smarter than everybody else.

But hey, go ahead and miss out on exponential growth to avoid a few downturns. Even though it was just pointed out to you that taking those downturns just mathematically isn't worth missing out on the growth days, I'm sure you're just smarter than all those dumb people.

stock market is like a shop where like the limbs of a company is sold.  Now, the money you used to buy their limbs will be used by the company to fund other things for their own. U might wonder why some stocks are expensive. Well let's put it this way, let's say that Angelina Jollie announces that she's selling her parts. And we know that Angelina Jollie is very popular, so that's the reason why her parts are more expensive. We can also say that she have done some controversy so her value declines and people will be selling her parts to somebody else. People sometimes will take advantage of this because the value is now cheaper. But we know, Angelina Jollie is can regain people's trust and again will boost value. How do we know this? It's publicly displayed in the media. Media will be our market. We check the TV for news and see what's currently happening. From there, we can see the current status although in real world, their are tickers for this. Ticker names is like Apple is to APPL. Now let's say that Angelina Jollie's stock price was $50 when you bought her back in 2000 and today the price is $150 because you know, Angelina gains so much popularity she was all over the media. You decided to sell the stock and now you just made $100 out of your $50.",['AAPL'],1

Some brokers signed it with not reading the ""$50,000 penalty if it was violated. Very plainly UWM was getting beat by a couple competitors and the Cry baby CEO didn't like that and gave brokers an ultimatum. I don't think I would believe what you see on the news. They probably are and will be hurting for business. Example. They used to have a minimum credit score of 640 and woulnd not take a modular home, nevermind a manufactured home. And I was told on the past they never will take lower credit scores and manufactured or modular homes, because they want good high quality deals. Lo and behold they lowered their minimum credot score and taking manufactured and modular homes. TRANSLATION: they lost so much business from brokers not signing the addendum that they had to change their business model and lower their requirements and add manufactured housing to try to get more loans in the door to keep their employees busy.

- They've been working on cutting down Liabilities
- COGS and SG&A costs have been cut down
- They've had consistently negative operating income,  but that's consistently and drastically (as COGS and SG&A costs improve)
- Net Income is still negative but has improved drastically
- Total Equity has doubled
- Long-term Debt has been nearly halved
- CapEx is consistently negative but improving
- Accounts Receivables is inconsistent
- Net Cashflow is now positive and improving

8883,gyzn77v,2021-05-21,t3_nhtxml,wallstreetbets,"I have a IBKR and Schwab account and here are my observations:

Things that bother me with Schwab:

1. Higher options trading level approval is pain in the ass 
2. Margin rate is much higher
3. Pre/after hours market is not open for the whole duration, rather \~2h pre/post market
4. Street Smart Edge is unnecessarily complicated and slow to use. Besides, you can't trade all instruments in it - Futures can only be traded in Street Smart Central via browser. Although IBKR's TWS looks archaic, I find it more streamlined and faster in use.
5. You have to set up separate trades to buy/sell during regular and extended trading sessions (In IBKR you can tick the ""include extended hours"" box). This one is really annoying - for example, I want a GTC order to buy AAPL at $100. I don't care if it will be executed during standard trading session or after hours or tomorrow morning - I just want it bought (or sold) at a particular price. That's impossible to do with Schwab. You have to set it up separately for each and every extended hours trading. Super annoying.
6. Pre/post market is unavailable for 5 mins just before or just after standard trading session. There's no such 5 min break with IBKR. Super annoying.
7. Standard margin requirement for holding particular shares is 30%. If I sell cash covered put, it will require 100% margin. If put gets executed, and I'm assigned shares, the required margin will again be 30%. I guess this has something to do with your option level approval but I don't see why higher options approval level changes the basic math. Very illogical and super super annoying.

Good things with Schwab (comparing with IBKR):

1. Zero fee shares trading
2. Schwab zero fees debit card
3. Support is generally more knowledgeable and accommodating. IBKR has a great support as well only if you get a US customer service representative. The problem is most of the times you'll get Indian with poor knowledge of the products.

And here you are apes, those are my observations.",['AAPL'],0

It's a mortgage that is higher than allowed by the ""Agencies"".  It is the oposite of what is know as a conforming loan.  The limit varies by market.  The mechanics mean the broker can't turn arround and sell it(as easily) as a conforming loan.  The take away is it can't be sold as easily as a non-jumbo.  They are particularly popular in California & NY.

In the past(before the metldown), jumbo's rates were higher.  Nowdays, it's the opposite, the risk on jumbo's is lower(mostly because the lenders tightened up, because it was on their books).  

For a wholesaler, it means more money is tied up vs the fees he would get for a conforming loan.  In other words, with the same money, the wholesaler could originate 2-3 mortgages, and collect the same fixed fees on each instead of just one jumbo.    In the end it means when the wholesaler reaches his in house money limit on the books, the less fees he collects.  I don't know how much day-to-day operations money UWMC has or what limits they face.  But, I do know it used to be wholesalers/lenders were compensated by higher interest rates of jumbos.",[],0
