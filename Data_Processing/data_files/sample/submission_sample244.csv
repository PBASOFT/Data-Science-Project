They take custody of binance and coinbase deposits, and in turn, created their own network called ""Silvergate Exchange Network"" to fund loans, which is collateralized by bitcoin. This statement is worrying to me. I'm not saying it will happen, but I wouldn't be surprised if btc collapsed and suddenly they're stuck with worthless collateral on bad loans.

45,2021-05-26,investing,"I’m wondering if this is very much discussed and more importantly, whether an expectation that they’ll be getting into this sector is already being priced into the current valuation.

I don’t think it’s particularly much of a secret, but just hear me out. They tend to start up a small business operation for a while, and just run within their org. If things turn out well at the experimental stage, they invest hard and fast, through acquisition and/or expanding the operation rapidly.

I’m looking at some tidbits where they’re mentioning employee-internal health services, basically clinics with doctors and such.

It seems to me this is a classic R&D effort inside a controlled environment. If they find they have a special sauce that could work in the marketplace, I would imagine there is going to be an announcement at one point where they’ll position a new Amazon product (whatever it’s going to be branded as, but I wouldn’t bat an eyelash if it was simply Amazon Health).

It’s an enormously profitable industry, it’s very hard to make inroads without serious capital and lobbying capacity, and Amazon has both. The incumbents have for the most part a pretty lousy customer experience, and between the software, the retail, and policy influence experience, I’d wager there is some serious potential. Add to this the currently heightened awareness about health care facilities and services.

I believe there is a 2 year time frame before there would be a significant announcement that would essentially put PPOs and HMOs on notice and make them sweat. There are plenty of successful boutique providers, small local hospitals, specialty clinics, a handful of franchises, but they’re all small scale. Acquiring a business that has the right real estate, and then implementing a health services model that allows people to get most ambulatory treatments without the enormous hassle, admin overhead, and time.... seems like a solid proposition in my book.

Wondering if anyone has some more info or related data about this, with specific angle to find an anticipated valuation for 2023 and beyond.",nlt418,[],1
85,2021-05-26,investing," **Business:**

LMP Motors $LMPX 's business model as “Buy, Rent or Subscribe, Sell and Repeat.” This means that we “Buy” pre-owned automobiles primarily through auctions or directly from other automobile dealers, and new automobiles from manufacturers and manufacturer distributors at fleet rates. LMPX Rents or Subscribe” by either renting automobiles to our customers or allowing them to enter into our subscription plan for automobiles in which customers have use of an automobile for a minimum of thirty (30) days. LMPX then sells its inventory, including automobiles previously included in our rental and subscription programs, to customers, and then we hope to “Repeat” the whole process.

**IPO and Price History:**

LMPX IPO'd in December 2019 at 5$ per share and has steadily increased throughout the past 18 months, reaching a peak of $45 earlier this year. It has since retraced in price and is currently trading at $15.8. This retracement is largely due to investors believing revenue guidance for 2021 was overstated based on December 2020 Q4 revenues of 4M.

**Revenue Growth and Forecast:**

LMPX reported 10.8m of revenues in 2019 and grew revenues to 30.4m for 2020. Representing a 180% increase in Revenues YoY.

LMPX forecasted revenues of 29m to 31m for Q1 2021 representing a 650% increase in revenues from Q4 2020.

LMPX full year 2021 revenues forecasted at 535 million

Shareholders called out the CEO on these revenues forecasts after Q4 results and the stock subsequently sold off.

**Q1 2021 Earnings Preliminary Numbers (To be reported after close tomorrow)**

LMPX quietly released its preliminary numbers last week directly to the SEC.

Reporting Revenues of $33m, representing 725% increase in revenues from the previous quarter.

Gross profit increased to 6M from 500k the previous quarter.

Cash increased of 1.4M to 19.4m through net operating cash flows.

These preliminary numbers beat the Q1 Guidance of 29M-31M by 15%.

The earnings call tomorrow will prove to shareholders and investors that this company is achieving substantial growth and the the forecasts are obtainable.

Guidance for the 2021 year is expected to increase above its 535 million to 570 million+.

**EBITDA:** EBITDA expected at 4.4% for 2021 of total revenues amounting to 25million which is to be used for repayment of loans on recent acquisitions.

**Valuation to Peers:**

**CVNA:**

Market Cap of 44.7B

Sales of 5.5B

P/S: 8.12

Revenue growth YoY: 41%

**VRM:**

Market Cap of 5.9B

Sales of 1.3B

P/S: 4.53

Revenue growth YoY: 14%

**LMPX:**

Market Cap of 158M

Sales of : 33M for Q1 (570M 2021 full year)

P/S: 0.27 (based on 2021 revenue Guidance)

Revenue growth YoY: 1766% (2020 to 2021 growth)

**LMPX** **Fair Value based on 2021 Sales:**

Market Cap: 2.5B

Share price: $256

P/S: 4.5

**Used Auto Market Growth:**

The used car market is booming, making it a perfect time for resellers. The shortage of new cars as a result of the global chip prices has demand for used cars surging.

Used car prices have jumped 21 percent since April 2020 and 10% of that came directly during April 2021.

This factor alone should drastically increase guidance for 2021 above the 535 forecast. April price jumps and demand surge will be reflected in next quarters earnings resulting in increased guidance.

**Key Acquisitions and Business Moves:**

LMPX has been making key acquisitions over the last few months which will help play into the bottom line.

**LMPX Acquisitions:**

Hometown Subaru - May 2021

2 Dodge/Chrysler Dealerships - April 2021

Bachman Bernard Chevy Buick Dealership - April 2021

New Ecommerce Website - March 2021

LTO Holdings Acquisition - February 2021

Atlantic Auto Group Acquisition - February 2021

Landed 660M syndicate credit line for use of Acquisitions - January 2021

LMPX started off the year with a bang and secured 660m of credit to use towards acquisition's. Which has been put to use over the first 5 months, purchasing multiple auto groups and dealerships. Securing backlogs of inventory and entering into new markets throughout the U.S. These acquisitions will be even more profitable with the recent 10% surge in used car prices in April 2021.

**Float:**

LMPX currently has 10.01m shares outstanding of which 4m are owned directly by management/insiders. Making the tradeable float roughly 6m. The lower the float means the quicker the price moves. Institutional holdings is low but I expect it to drastically increase after tomorrows earnings resulting in a even smaller tradeable float.

**Summary:**

LMPX will report revenues of 33M tomorrow representing a 725% increase from prior quarter. This will bring back investors who dumped their shares after the CEO was called out for ""overstating guidance"". This earnings report will beat expectations by 10-15% and Revenue guidance is expected to be bumped higher to the high 570 million range. New investors will be drawn in from the quarter over quarter growth reported on the call. The recent boom in used auto prices and demand will further excel LMPX as a market leader. If LMPX continues to exceed revenues estimates and obtain 550M+ revenue for 2021 its fair value compared to its peers should be at $250+ a share representing a 1582% increase from its current share price.

Get in on the ground floor tomorrow before the earnings call. LMPX ran today as investors started to catch on to the SEC filing of preliminary numbers. We should see a 20% + move after hours tomorrow and quick run back to its ATH of $45.",nltrog,[],1
93,2021-05-26,investing,"I’ve been studying some of the new Fidelity actively managed ETFs, but I’m still trying to understand how the tracking basket effects the purchase and sale price.

125,2021-05-26,investing,"As I posted before, **you will** get a cash payout of $2.53 per share for each Hertz share you own. That is not in question.

Plus, and here is where the confusion is, you will get 1.04 Stock warrants for each share you currently own. Each warrant is good for buying 1 share of the reorganized Hertz for $10.

So, **what is a warrant** and **what is the warrant worth**?

**The warrant is** the right to purchase a share of a company at a designated strike price. So even if Hertz is trading at $15 a share, you would have the right to purchase a share at $10.

**The warrants worth is** market determined. You can choose to do 1 of two things (for this example, we will use $15 as the current price at which the new reorganized Hertz is trading):

**1)** Exercise the warrant - buy the share for the $10 and for this example you would instantly increase your position to from the $10 you spent to the $15 current trade price.

**2)** Sell the warrant - you can sell\\trade the warrant just like any option. The only difference is that you would instantly receive a cash distribution. You would essentially sell you warrants for $5 per warrant. The new owner would now own the right to exercise, and you will receive the cash difference to the current market price.

**Example (the one used by the investor group that is purchasing HTGQ):**

So, in this case the total value of the HTZGQ stock is the $2.53 cash plus the $5 warrant value. Which totals $7.53 on a stock that is currently trading at $6. That is a 25% ROI in 3 weeks if you invested today.

There is the possibility that the new reorganized shares will trade at less than $13.50 a share. Which would mean $2.53 plus 3.50 or less. Total of $6.03 or less. Which would mean you would only break even or lose money at today’s price of $6.

**Here is where I insert that I am not a professional financial advisor, and you should consult yours before investing.** *My belief is this.... Hertz traded in the* ***$20-$40*** *range for the 5 years prior to the pandemic. It had shaky financials for years leading up to the stress test of the pandemic and their failure. But now it has a reduced debt structure and a hot rental market. I must believe that the new Hertz will trade at the same or higher than its previously debt burdened self.*

I think the shares of the reorganized Hertz land in the mid $20's the first day of trading. if this happens 1 share will be worth $2.53 + $10 = $12.53. So, at today’s price of $6, you would see a 200%+ return in 3 weeks.

I just turned 30, and  while my total income is pretty low at only about $13,500ish a year  (YA, Phlebotomy Jobs suck, apparently...), my Living costs are ALSO  pretty low, only roughly $600-700 a month. This is combination of low  rent, the lack of any real vices (I don't smoke, drink, do any kind of  drugs etc etc) and not really going out and doing anything.

Most  of my entertainment comes in the form of games and novels and the  like.Suffice to say, that means despite being what most would consider  ""Poor"", I've not really had to ""struggle"" with much. Even now, I've got  about $2,000 invested in stocks that I play around with and use to  learn, as well as about $4,000 in savings for emergencies.

That's  even AFTER buy a top of the line 10th gen computer just recently to  replace my old one (again, even being ""poor"" by most standards). Now I  know this probably isn't impressive to a lot of people here, more so  those who make a lot more and probably quicker too, but for where I am  and what I've had available to me, I think I'm going pretty well.

That  being said, I know I have to start planning for the Future as well.The  Only problem Is, I don't really know HOW.

1. S & P 500 might be in bubble considering current and historical PE
2. USA is still great, probably best country in the world, with many good companies. But USA is challenged by China and in next decades Asia will simple have higher growth of GDP. 
3. USD is world reserve currency and by far most traded currency. However importance of dollar might decrease 

S&P PE ratio is high currently. If it gets bellow 20, I would be exposed more. Probably 70% to 80%. If S&P PE ratio goes to 90 +, i would cut index and buy big cap companies with low PE

However most of world is still garbage. Including China

One way to go around this, is invest in competitive industries abroad, where Americans lost edge.

For example semiconductors in Taiwan and Korea. They profit from China growth, yet is a industry which Chinese will not control in next decade or two. However I wouldn't be comfortable buying whole market index there. Anyway both governments (Korean and Taiwanese) heavily subsidies semiconductors. So bet on whole semiconductor industry, is actually bet on their government too. Their currencies, especially TWD is super stable (look Taiwan forex reserve).

When bet on Japan, i would go for dividend stock index in Japan. Many great, big stable companies with 4 % dividend

And I would consider betting on index in India, cause whole market will raise up crazy in next 30 year.

I still work up my portfolio but roughly idea is:

- 50% american stocks (market ETF)
- 15% Taiwanese and Korean semiconductors (ETD for semiconductor)
- 15 % India (market ETF)
- 10 % EU (Just 2 companies Airbus, Volkswagen. Again bet on them is betting on EU)
- 10 % Japan (either dividend index or I would pick 5 dividend stocks)

So I am covered for currencies risk, plus betting on India. As well having mix of ETF and few stocks i personally pick up. And in Japan I cover dividend stocks

533,2021-05-19,investing,"Throughout the lifecycle of bitcoin, I've heard this statement over and over again. ""Bitcoin is gold for the 21st century""... ""Bitcoin is protection against jpow's printer"".... ""Bitcoin prevents against USD debasement""...

I have nothing against blockchain tech on its own. I think there are some wonderful aspects to the technology. With that said, the amount of narratives used to sell bitcoin to others that are just completely wrong on a variety of levels is getting to be rather stupid. And given today's selloff, it's a good opportunity to explain how the narrative is completely disconnected from reality.

**Bitcoin As Inflation Protection = Bad Narrative**

I have said for a long time that bitcoin is a RISK ASSET. It's yet another in a long line of strong performing financial assets that have done well in our environment of excess liquidity and low inflation. In this light, it's not that different from the growth investing asset class.

If bitcoin actually served as any form of inflation protection, then why in the world did it tank 12% on the day that we got the highest YOY CPI print in over a decade? And nobody can argue that it was a product of interest rates rising... since they haven't risen in any significant way since that inflation print. And it's now tanked almost 40% at a time when you would expect any idea of inflation protection to be the strongest driver of the asset class. Something... doesn't add up here.

Why make up incorrect beliefs to justify purchasing something, when there are perfectly reasonable bull cases to be made that aren't dependent on misleading people on the economics of inflation and ""money printing""? And for whatever it's worth, Gold suffers from some of the same problems, although it obviously behaves a bit differently than crypto.

**Bad Economic Narratives Dominate Bitcoin Beliefs**

* How many times do people need to show you M2 charts before they actually take a minute and compare M2 to the actual inflation levels? Hint for those who aren't aware, growth in M2 is 100% meaningless if it causes an equivalent drop in the velocity of money.
* How many times do people need to call quantitative easing ""money printing"", without understanding how quantitative easing actually works? Hint: the ""money printing"" comes from temporary fiscal stimulus, not from the fed pushing reserves that are never used onto banks' balance sheets.
* How many times do people misunderstand that ""asset inflation"" (which is just another word for a bubble) is different than consumer price inflation? Hint: Real consumer price inflation is typically rather negative for more speculative risk assets (such as bitcoin).
* How many times do people need to suggest the US dollar is ""getting killed"" before they actually look at a price history chart of the US Dollar? Hint: the US dollar is more or less right in the middle of it's price range over the last 50+ years, is significantly higher than it was throughout the entire time period from 2005-2015, and hasn't even dropped that far this year despite the massive amount of stimulus + fed swap lines used since the Covid pandemic. You would think that if the US dollar was ***actually*** debasing, we would get more than a 5% drawdown during the largest stimulus package ever. 

&#x200B;

My personal subjective opinion is that Bitcoin is yet another risk asset that benefits largely from too much money chasing too few assets. This IS actually in part a product of quantitative easing, but the irony here is that QE is not actually causing inflation. I think blockchain will likely be used in the future for a wide variety of uses, but I have no clue whether Bitcoin will serve any actual functions aside from speculative ownership. Note: I do not own any crypto or crypto-oriented stocks, so I don't have anything to either gain or lose here.

And by the way, this is not intended as a bullish or bearish post on bitcoin. Just trying to debunk some of the very obviously incorrect narratives that have been sold to the public over the years.",ngamt2,[],0

While I understand and agree with the previous statement, I am conflicted. When comparing a fund with a 0.015% expense ratio vs one with 0.7%, the fund with higher expense ratio comes out ahead when it out performs the lower expense ratio fund by 0.625%. 

When looking at Fidelity mutual funds it appears that most funds with a higher expense ratios out perform ones with lower expense ratios by significantly more than 0.625%. Examples:

&#x200B;

**Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX):**

\-Expense ratio 0.7%, 1yr +51.28%, 5yr +28.61%, 10yr +21.23%

In this example, and in several higher expense ratio mutual funds I looked at, it appears beneficial to pay the higher expense ratio.

546,2021-05-27,investing,"Coinbase pro is number 5 by volume with 7bn of daily volume as of yesterday. Binance with 40bn is the biggest. So if most of the revenue of Coinbase comes from transaction fees which is linearly correlated with transaction volume the market cap of All crypto exchanges together are insanely high. 

Coinbase at 63bn market cap implies a 9bn per bn transaction volume. So that makes the top 5 exchange  with total transaction volume of 77bn worth a whopping 693bn in market cap (while the value of the underlying cryptos at just 1.4trillion!!!)

670,2021-05-27,investing,"I looked into investing part of my portfolio into a Vanguard LifeStrategy 80 Accumulating ETF.

However, I use DeGiro for a broker and realized that there is very low volume - zero for most days, on this ETF.

I looked at the one traded at Euronext Amsterdam. 

Is it possible that DeGiro only shows volume of trades on its platform? That makes little sense, and even if I can’t believe there would be zero volume.

Is there something I am missing?",nm223d,[],0

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/121515/why-3x-etfs-are-riskier-you-think.asp

Some of these articles make it sound like some tooth fairy is going to emerge from the ethos and steal all the capital you have in your account. As if your position is just going to permanently vaporize forever.

I have invested in some inverse leveraged ETFs, and their performance over the last however many years has been just fine. If I buy the ETF at a low market price, why would it not eventually go back up, as it has cyclically over the course of maybe 10 years or more?

Is there something going on that is going to take money out of my position and steal some of the shares I own? Is the ETF somehow withdrawing cash from my positions?

Or is the concern limited to the simple performance of the fund? It would seem to me if the ETF itself has a long and successful track record of matching the movements of the underlying asset, why not buy low and sell high?",nm50u3,[],0

So I have some shares in a broker that I no longer fully trust I think I never should have trusted them in the first place, but had no idea what pfof was, or that they feel that it's their job to be defenders of the marketplace, rather than sellers of stock.

As it takes 8-10 business days to transfer shares,  I'm wondering what happens if the stocks are still locked up when the squeeze happens.
