In a few years I think I’ll be just fine, however, I’m definitely slowing my buying for the next few months with Disney. It’s got potential to go up from its current price, however, it’s more likely to go down I feel than rebound to its prior price. So I’ll be buying, just less so than I would if the price were 150-160 right now. Ya feel? :0

Also did you look at Intels chart in your research? Not sure why you pegged it as stable growth given its recent history and standing in the semi conductor market. It went straight down from 2000 to 2009, not exactly consistent growth. It then grew for a few years during the recovery and then consolidated. It’s now had swings of 15-20% like 6 times in the last 4 years. I like intel but you might be betting on a bad horse, TBD. Back to being new in the market, you shouldn’t be trying to chase earnings plays, and there’s no reason you need be stuck with MRNA if you want out.

As for TSLA, what gave you the impression it would surge for another day and why 15 dollars? If it was as easy as just saying wow it’s going up, it’s “surging” I think I can make 15 dollars, we’d all be rich. Was there a catalyst? Increase in volume?

In the end, they save no money on the mortgage. However, this does cause a jump in home prices. Honestly, buyers would be better off with a higher interest rate. Especially if they have a lot of cash on hand or can pay the mortgage off early. 

Low interest rates really benefit the seller, not the buyer. If you want to buy a house you should be hoping interest rates go up. Unless you have no cash and would never consider paying your loan off early. In which case it probably does not matter one way or the other.",[],0
138,gynbm02,2021-05-19,t1_gyn23m7,stocks,"The main reason some FAANGs will grow slower in the future is because they are running out of potential users. 

It was easy for FB to grow from 1 million to 1 billion monthly active users (a factor of 1000). It's impossible for FB to grow from 1 billion to 1 trillion users (another factor of 1000), because this many people don't exist. It's also becoming very difficult for FB to grow revenue per user without losing users.

To grow more, they will have to invent all new sellable technology from zero, like Apple did with iPhone for example, and this is a lot harder to accomplish consistently and open to competition by new startups.

Furthermore, there is significant regulatory headwind coming up for the ad-tech companies (FB and Google), and potentially higher corporate taxes in multiple big markets.

Amazon and Microsoft are in a different league, and in my opinion have more room for growth because the move to cloud computing is not nearly complete yet, and there is no limit to how much cloud computing power a single human user might want or need in the future.

This list is by no means exhaustive....

Processing and memory density:
The Bekenstein bound limits the amount of information that can be stored within a spherical volume to the entropy of a black hole with the same surface area.

Thermodynamics limit the data storage of a system based on its energy, number of particles and particle modes. In practice, it is a stronger bound than the Bekenstein bound.

Processing speed:
Bremermann's limit is the maximum computational speed of a self-contained system in the material universe, and is based on mass-energy versus quantum uncertainty constraints.

Communication delays:
The Margolus–Levitin theorem sets a bound on the maximum computational speed per unit of energy: 6 × 10^33 operations per second per joule. This bound, however, can be avoided if there is access to quantum memory. Computational algorithms can then be designed that require arbitrarily small amounts of energy/time per one elementary computation step.

Energy supply:
Landauer's principle defines a lower theoretical limit for energy consumption: kT ln 2 consumed per irreversible state change, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the operating temperature of the computer. Reversible computing is not subject to this lower bound. T cannot, even in theory, be made lower than 3 kelvins, the approximate temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, without spending more energy on cooling than is saved in computation. However, on a timescale of 10^9 - 10^10 years, the cosmic microwave background radiation will be decreasing exponentially, which has been argued to eventually enable 10^30 as much computations per unit of energy.",[],0

236,gynggyw,2021-05-19,t1_gyne9he,stocks,"What you would save on the house over a 30-year mortgage due to having a lower interest rate gets added to the price of the home.

Say a drop in interest makes it where the home ends up being 40,000 cheaper over the course of the 30-year loan. 

The 40,000 basically gets added to the sticker price of the home. So the house is now going to be 40,000 more expensive. 

But not quite because you would also be paying interest on the extra 40,000 too. So maybe you end up paying 35,000 more for the house and the other 5,000 would be interested in the 35,000. 

The issue is people like to max out what they can borrow. Lower interest means they can borrow more so they will pay more. The only thing stopping them from paying say 40,000 more is they can't borrow 40,000 more. When the bank says yeah you can have 40,000 more because of the lower interest. They spend 40,000 more. 

When the bank says now you can borrrow 40,000 less. They spend 40,000. 

 Since you will be competing with these people you will have to spend 40,000 more if they can borrow it.

410,gynosyp,2021-05-19,t1_gylkelc,stocks,"I see examples like this all the time and find them quite reductive. Human capacity to drive is at an end-state. All our biological/neurological advantages are baked in and essentially maxed out. In aggregate, humans will never be meaningfully better drivers than we are now. Computer are not yet great at city driving, but are getting better and *will only* *get better* (barring an inevitable hiccup in the form of a Therac-25-style programming disaster, ETA 2027). 

Here's a counter-scenario. It is obviously not where we are at now, but it's where we are headed: 

  
Ok, so a soccer ball rolls out from between two cars. You, a human, have two eyes and they are pointed elsewhere, and/or you're thinking about something else, and/or you're distracted by another person or beeping thing in your own car, and/or you're tired, and/or you're old and have poor reflexes. You see the ball, but at a delay—you stop but in the process a) you give the hypothetical lil tyke a love-tap resulting in a minor concussion and a major lawsuit and/or b) a car following you too close rear-ends you at somewhere between 0-35 mph, depending on their own confounding factors, because the same issues apply to them, people are impatient and self-centred, and they can't read your mind. 

  
Your car, an AI trained over several years at a rate of billions and then tens of billions of miles per year, has \~9 eyes arranged with full 360º coverage, redundant along the most important vector (ahead of you). They all feed data at a constant, manageable and predictable rate to dual redundant chipsets custom-designed for the task, at a faster FPS than humans can process. It is in constant communication with every car around you via a shared protocol designed to optimize the behaviour of unrelated vehicles in traffic and to coordinate reactions to unexpected events. Your car knows there's a meaningful chance that a child or dog follows that ball, because duh: this has happened literally millions of times in its training. It stops faster than you possibly could, and signals the car behind you to do the same, essentially in real-time. You probably avoid hitting the kid, but if you do it's at a much lower speed than you would have without a self-driving vehicle; ditto for your hypothetical rear-ender. If anyone hits anything the legal burden settles somewhere up the chain and isn't your problem. 

  
Like I said, this is not where we are but it is where we're going. The inflection point for cars outperforming human drivers in incidents/mile on highways has almost certainly already been passed by the most capable systems.

It's so easy to get caught up in worst-case scenarios and what-ifs and they need to be accounted for, definitely. But what about the possible upside? Don't we want the driving experience to become more frictionless (figuratively, of course), less fraught with biological, financial and moral hazards? Between human and AI, only one path leads to meaningful progress from where we are. We're not at an end-state unless we insist we are.",['AI'],0

415,gynox5d,2021-05-19,t1_gyn84ws,stocks,"Big thanks for the honest critique. I bought into Intel mostly because of its name. My impression of Intel going in was that it was a strong company with a solid credibility in the processor industry. That likely clouded my judgment when I read its earnings reports and compared it to AMD’s. I was aware that Intel had lost some ground, but for me at the time, it was a temporary hiccup. After all, it’s Intel, the king of microprocessors; why can’t they recover? Maybe it’s that same clouded judgment that’s making me hold it for the long run (or maybe it’s because it pays dividends, unlike AMD and Nvidia).

As for Moderna, consider it a major lesson learned. I’d successfully chased earnings for four straight stocks prior to Moderna (flipped both ATVI and AAWW on the same day for more than a $200 profit), so I was very much hyped for its earnings to get me some quick cash. Well, now I’m stuck with it until it crawls back up to 178 again because my stubborn ass refused to sell at a loss.

It's currently trading at $40. Even if it recovers to $50 that's a nice 25% bump. If you're a bull at it goes to $60 that's a 50% bump. I see it as a great opportunity for value, and I think investor sentiment and interest will improve too with all these media mergers happening.

562,gynxaoj,2021-05-19,t1_gynox5d,stocks,"No problem! I just think one month is far to short of a time frame to try and really label winners or losers for any position, let alone positions you picked while being fresh to the market. You're not day trading these picks, you think they could recover (and they may. I have hope, I like intel) but surely you didn't expect that to happen within a month, so why the regret? Why are you labeling it a loser at this point?  It's been a month in a weird market, let things play out a little bit. The comeback could be years in the making if Intel is able to pull it off, plus they do have a dividend as you note. 

Did you just guess those companies would have good earnings? Or what made you play those as earnings plays? Considering even good earnings have resulted in sell offs and things being ""priced in"" if you will, it seems like a tough thing to try and do consistently. If that's what you want to do, do it, but since the trade didn't work out, why hold it? Being stubborn is just tying your money up. Now I'm not saying to take the loss, but think about what you want to do, and that play in particular. If you want to trade earnings plays, are you going to hold every one that tanks because you're stubborn? You'll run out of free capital fast. Don't let your emotions change your trade plan. If your plan was ""I'm buying and its going to go up after earnings"" then you should add some more depth to your plan, imo. Now if you want to hold Moderna because its a good stock or it balances your portfolio out, great. Again I'm not saying hold Intel, or sell Moderna, but to just look at what you're doing and why. Stick to your trade plan/thesis.

>As for Tesla, the only indication that it would surge for a third day   
was that it surged for two straight. As I said, chalk that failed chase   
attempt to complete lack of experience.

If it was that easy, we'd both be sipping margaritas in margaritaville..or whatever it is rich people do, ha.

I'm personally not into some of the crazy astrology stuff like the triple flying rocket mutated doge seaweed pattern, but things like volume, moving averages, and basic support and resistance can go a long long ways.

Of course still a better hedge against inflation than lithium. :)

There are many companies pitching the same thing. Umicore (already doing that), a few ones in Australia, Vulcan in Germany.

In the end it’s all about supply and demand. If you won’t have batteries to recycle, then your technology is not used to its potencial (likely scenario in the next at least 5-10 years). If you have cheap and green source of lithium (possible in 10+ years) then recycling processes won’t be that important.",[],0

They've gone up over time and right now a lot of companies are doing well and will continue to do well as long as they are on the right side of a shortage. Nucor is doing well because of steel prices and this probably will persist for the year, but when supply and demand normalize, so will many of these companies profits, as 2020 and 2021 this far seem to be outliers as far as earnings go, and moving forward the market will have different expectations. 

I am bullish on steel until after summer, after that, I will worry a bit more.

I'm a fan of semiconductor plays like , QCOM, Lam research, AMD and intel (long hold, short is hairy.) I like big tech with good earnings and decently low peg and pe multiples. Tech is presenting some good buying opportunities, but the market is rampant with companies that just simply won't make it. Stick to blues chip names that have gotten beaten up and dca into a solid position. Anything else speculative, may be comparable to catching a falling knife.

Apph isn't terrible and has promise. 

EV is solid, but very expensive for most investments right now, as most don't turn a profit. Tesla barely even turns a profit and is the first mover. To play this space, I would go with legacy automakers like Gm or ford or volkswagen, as they are on a path to integrate EVs into their lineups. 

Other than automakers, I would buy lithium miners like Livent or albemarle. Precious metals like palladium and rhodium related stocks may also be good buys because PGM metals are used in EV cars as well as ICE cars. 

Right now, industrials are good, although with the inflation narrative, stocks with pricing power are in demand. Healthcare, tobacco, oil (eh, I'm bullish, but I'm biased), food and beverage (pepsi, Coca-Cola, etc) will probably do decent under this volatility, but won't make you heaps of money either. 

Banks are also decent buys, I like Citi and BAC. They will do well under inflation BUT have already went on a bit of a tear so dca into a position may be smart.",[],1

If something like that were to happen with steel I imagine it wouldn't be good. Although I find this unlikely, it's a possibility. 

Airplanes believe it or not I would short or sell, I would only hold southwest airlines, as only domestic flights in US are actually going to resume at a decent rate. With inflation happening as well, I'm not sure what I would do with airlines. People have wild expectations for these stocks but don't realize how indebted these companies are, american airlines is mired in debt, and has a pretty bad balance sheet to support their ridiculous rally. 

Restaurants and retail are dependant on an individual company basis as well. Certain companies have pricing power during inflation, some don't. Evaluate that, as it's only going to get more wobbly. But you're in the right place with industrials right now, I think it's rocky but my main conviction plays right now are oil, (similar concept to your steel) and financials with a touch of healthcare as a hedge for inflation.

I mainly buy shares and hold to invest, but oil I'm taking a swing approach and planning to sell most of my position when I reach my goal, and then hold the rest for long, that may be a good idea with your steel as well, as they are both ""commodities"" that are undergoing a massive cycle.

In a sense, DCA is really similar to a wide diversification - you have no idea when and where the market will go, so you just constantly buy no matter what is happening.    
Diversification - spreading out your investments across the whole market, since you have no clue which companies will go up and which will go down.

If you sold at a loss then you triggered a wash sale on 40 shares of the other lot because you may be inside the 31 day window. If you thought you were selling 40 shares at a profit it is possible you sold the wrong shares. For example the system sold 40 shares First In First out and sold 40 out of the first 50 shares at a loss thus triggering a wash sale on ten shares and 30 shares of another lot. When you have to separate lots with purchase dates that close together inside 30 day window you need to be careful to not sell at a loss.
