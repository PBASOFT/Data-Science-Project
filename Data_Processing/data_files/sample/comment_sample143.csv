I believe GM stock is undervalued by half at least. Usually a company like GM should be trading at a multiple, instead they are trading for half the market cap of total earnings. Not saying this is the only factor but is definitely there. The EV vehicle transitions followed by announcements, release dates, increased earnings, new jobs all could be leading factors why GM stock reaches $90.  
My plays are as follow:  
BUY GM OPTION $90 TARGET EXPIRATION JAN 2022 x 10 contracts  
BUY GM OPTION $90 TARGET EXPIRATION JAN 2023 x 10 contracts  
GM has the infastructure to support a massive takeover of EV, Tesla can barely deliver cars to people that ordered them 6 months ago. The market cap difference is $650 Billion. When GM siphons some of that market cap you can see GM stock trading anywhere from $150 to $300 making traders profits of anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million in profits. Check Options profit calculator for that option play and look at profit targets of $90 to $300. It will show what each option will be worth at each price level

Their customers may be the biggest beneficiaries. Except telecom was the most profitable space-based business, and SpaceX itself has cornered the satellite internet business (Starlink). And Starlink can do a lot of things that used to be done by multi-billion dollar geostationary telecommunications satellites. All other space-based businesses are pretty niche. Maybe satellite imaging, like Planet Labs? (Though they are not publicly traded.) Or perhaps companies that make avionics and satellite buses for smallsats and cubesats.

For day job income, no.  But with investing, if you realize a gain in the short term, it's taxed at your nominal rate.  Some folks, not being aware of this, will take all the gains from a single big YOLO, and spend it on additional investments, a home, lambo, etc.  The following year at tax reporting time, the IRS says ""hey based on how much you made last year, you either owe us more or we owe you.""  If they're a standard W2 employee, taxes are automatically deducted from one's paycheck so that come tax time, they aren't manually figuring out tax amounts owed from their job.  However with a large YOLO gain like this, no taxes are automatically deducted.  That gain will be reported to the IRS by one's brokerage as is standard, and during tax prep time, you have to report all your investment gains/losses.  Those investment gains/losses are added to your day job income, and that final number (minus any deductions) is the amount you will pay taxes on.  

All this to say, if you're not holding back some additional cash to pay the capital gains tax on a yolo gain like this, you're going to be in for a surprise come tax time the following year.",[],0

Too volatile to provide protection

Gold, the world‚Äôs most prized ‚Äústore of value,‚Äù has proven a poor investment over the past nearly half-century. Since 1980, its price has matched inflation, but with gigantic swings along the way. Over the next 21 years it lost over three-quarters of its ‚Äúreal‚Äù value and didn‚Äôt get even until 2011. It‚Äôs anything but a reliable inflation hedge, since it only keeps up with CPI measured across many decades, or even centuries. Gold does romp in periods of turmoil, as in the oil crises of 1974 and 1978, and the Great Recession. But if you didn‚Äôt sell the precious metal when the economy started to recover, you‚Äôd give back the gains.  Gold‚Äôs drawback is its big, unpredictable fluctuations. At times, speculators think it‚Äôs a jewel; in other periods, it‚Äôs viewed as a dog. Overall, gold displays about the same volatility as the dollar and other major currencies, and as the S&P 500. The difference with U.S. stocks is that over the long haul, you get well rewarded for the bumpy ride. With gold, you don‚Äôt.

Yet Bitcoin is four times as volatile as gold. From December 2017 to February 2018, its price collapsed from $19,000 to $6,300. It experienced another 65% drop from April 2018 to January 2019, then recovered by June of that year, only to plummet another 60% by December. Source Fortune Shawn Tully article",[],0

5/20/2021 9:48am EDT
By Ian Bezek, InvestorPlace Contributor


UWM Holdings (NYSE:UWMC) is a most interesting company. UWM, which is short for United Wholesale Mortgage, rose to prominence earlier this year thanks to the r/WallStreetBets excitement. Traders bid it up in hopes of a huge short squeeze. This did not happen. In fact, UWMC stock has crashed. However, unlike many Reddit stocks, this one appears to be a fundamentally strong company trading at a compelling valuation.

5339,gytrz2c,2021-05-20,t1_gysf3lq,wallstreetbets,"Sure, you take in all the factors and treat it like a day job and not a casino, and you do well. I did this betting $20/time over the course of hours. You see where the ball is landing, and where the other players are betting, and usually do well to not put your larger portion where everyone else is. Sometimes there are hotspots, but on big bets, the ball usually falls elsewhere. Slow and steady keeps the gains, and when the icer comes out, take a break. It also always helps to have a full table. 

When you're up, you don't bet big. This kills a lot of players. The same system applies to stocks. Some bets don't pan out, but with patience and proper attention, a lot do. Like I said, learn to Roulette. A system without modification and a plan only goes so far.

For the record, I've used and tested this system and my mods extensively on roulette apps before betting at the casino, and have beat the odds there too.

We were working on an $8M capital improvement project.  The largest costs on the program were 4 air compressors (2 COTS and 2 custom jobs).  The cost of the custom jobs was $2M.  These things took like 8 months to make by the supplier and a huge cost liability for them if GE (with their crazy net 180 purchasing terms) decided to not pay or take delivery.  So Atlas Copco (supplier) said we need you to make progress payments on these compressors to the tune of 10% per quarter until delivery or we will charge you 10% on top of the final value.  GE scoffed at the progress payments but decided the 10% upcharge was no big deal.  So GE paid AC $200,000 just so they didn't have to make progress payments.

Also, with GE's net 180 payment terms, a lot of suppliers won't even sell to them (see Unholtz-Dickie).   They have to pay this middle man (Ferguson) money to make purchases for them.

Until they can fix these issues with GE capital they won't become the force they once were.",['GE'],0

It was shorted 140% and the price was under 40$, whatever it went up it affected all 140% of shorts.

Now its like any other stock out there, shorted like under 30%, part of it shorted at probably very high prices and part also probably at around 180$.

Idk what else you all are waiting for at this point, its definitely not a short squeeze because there is not going to be any by the technicals alone. Nobody is going to swoop in and buy 55 mil of GME shares to force a short squeeze, they probably can't even buy so much of a company without huge documentation that will be public and allow every remainind short to run.

On top of that the price before doubled, tripled, quadripled, 10x, when you wake up and stock you shorted went up 10x, this is something. Right now nothing like that is even remotely possible, best you can get is the stock price doubling, and that is if you are lucky. Whoever is shorting it is just not going to be that affected.

There was even a case when it was 70% shorted still, but now the stock is like any other stock on the market, except for the army of cult retards following it.

The disrespect has been pushed too far lately, lame ass mofos litteraly praying for the market to crash, working relentlessly, even tho its clearly still bull for the rest of year-ish. 
Not cool to short so hard, in the end everybody loses cause it only emphasizes swings and places PT range in the low end cause' everyone scared, ultimately losing max potential gains on both sides just so a bunch of egoistic fuk-turds and snowflake idiots flip a few bucks!

Cant wait for the next big squeeze to happen, shit is inevitable now. I wonder which ticker it'll be?üëÄüëÄü§´

IMO it's to get some on the books before the possibility of a suboptimal US crop as the growing season begins. It is already known that a near-perfect crop will be needed to replenish US inventories this year. Big crop = lower prices and China backs out of the sales they have recently made. Bad crop = higher prices and they keep their commitments. 

We're seeing this take place right now. Argentina is undercutting the fuck out of US exports which is where a majority of the world's corn is coming from and China is backing out of a bunch of prior commitments. With Argentina exports coming to a halt (as of yesterday) due to a worker strike, nearby July corn could see some life yet. 

If you're going to play corn you better make damn sure that you're not in a position on 6/30 because it's going to shit the bed on higher than initially forecasted acres planted this year. It has been a remarkably dry spring and prices are the highest they've been since 2013. 

The market is going to be paying attention to domestic weather closer than ever this year and if the US does go into a drought and cannot produce a crop the size of last year or better, corn/soy/wheat will hit all-time highs.

It‚Äôs not like there was any way to prove that he‚Äôs not anyways. Plus I feel that there‚Äôs something suspicious going on with UWMC‚Äôs trend today and yesterday. My initial intention with UWMC options was a small gain. I‚Äôm going to sell the position sometime today or tomorrow if it feels good enough profit and observe the situation during the next week. The market volatility is crazy and the dumpings that we saw in cryptocurrency alerts me something. I‚Äôm not a financial advisor so if you have any other theory please share. During the past few weeks all the Memes stocks that were mentioned on Wall Street bets have not been working according to how they were mentioned on the posts. I feel and agree with the fact that something bigger is working the financial system and it is against the retailers. If you think about it, who takes the premium when an option is bought? And when it expires worthless, who really wins? 
The unfortunate but unassailable principle in economy is that the most lucrative income really comes from large number of small gains. Think how much the oil price has gone up.  It‚Äôs gone up by less than a dollar but if you think about how many people use the oil on a daily basis unless it‚Äôs a huge gain for the government. Likewise during this time of crisis imagine how many people started investing in the stock market and how many people became retailers and how much premiums can be collected from all of them.

Let me guess. You think that because the market goes up sharply, volatility increase and thus the VIX too increase ? negative delta, which doesn't make the VIX go up as the market increases. Even if it's sharply.

You might've heard of Black-Scholes, but I doubt you understand the formulas behind. There's something called negative delta, which doesn't make the VIX go up as the market increases. Even if it's sharply.

Of course, it's more complicated than just that, there is more factor to take into account, but basically, no the VIX doesn't go up as the market goes up.

Here's a quick and short explanation just for you :)

It's now trying to recover, but the action is a little shaky as this remains a rather illiquid stock (due to the fact it's mostly institutionally owned). But make no mistake, this has formed a solid base around $8 and once it gets a bid and increased volume as another institution steps in or insider purchases a few more shares, it will have a massive short covering. Last year, such an instance incurred and pushed the stock up intraday as high as 75%.  
Fundamentally, it is oversold and underpriced and I would be very nervous if I were a short. Some large shorts aren't able to cover because of the lack of liquidity as if they were to cover 100 or 200K shares, it would fly 10% higher in a matter of minutes, so they churn it.  
Good luck and welcome to the SDC trade if you wish to bet on a 50-80% upside potential within 6 months. Cheers",[],0
