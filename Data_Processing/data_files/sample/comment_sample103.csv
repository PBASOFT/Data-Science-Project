642,gz6jugj,2021-05-23,t1_gz6haap,wallstreetbets,"They have First-Mover Advantage, nationwide, they are the first to each state to offer a Sportsbook.

With this industry, mobile gambling, there‚Äôs literally variety or differences between companies so the only way to stay on top is through retention rates, and typically if you start with a specific book, you wont change over. For example, I started my offshore gambling career with Bovada and since i‚Äôve there‚Äôs be hundreds of different books for me to use but I always go back to Bovada. 

This will be similar with DKNG, since they have First-Mover or First-Market Advantage, players will always go back to use their platform. So right now, the only main factor DKNG should be focusing on his EXPANSION and RETENTION. If they can expand to as many people as possible and offer as many promotions as possible in the growth period in said state (1-3 years), they will retain those same people.  

You might ask, how does DKNG know that this method works, easy, New Jersey legalized in 2018, and FanDuel employed this same strategy. They were first and pumped insane promotions. Now they own the largest handle in that state. If you‚Äôre first to a state and offer promotions in the growth stage you will end up on top. I see DKNG and Fanduel being #1 and #2 in every state in the future. Whoever spends more money at the start of the race will win the race. I just think DKNG has way better promotional opportunities right now (mentioned in post) 

Also, to touch upon what you said about taking advantage of promotions, sure you may be up $1000 to year, but those promotions are only their to increase player activity on their app at this time. Those promotions are an investment that people like you will go back in 10-15 years, so it‚Äôs a $1000 out of there pocket today, for $2000 back in the next five years as you lose money.

Time to throw on the $CLOV tinfoil hats again

To my understanding, Greenoaks Capital recently converted their -96 million Class B shares to Class A common stock shares, which brings  the total outstanding shares to ~ 312 million. With this sudden increase in institutional ownership of common stock and lack of an offering, the float is now ~13  million instead of 110M, which is still being reported on Webull, etc. SI was originally 38%ish (38 million shares short, 110M float) but I believe with this new development it is the reason Yahoo Finance and Ortex are both reporting over 300% short interest (38 million still short, with 13 million float) All I know for a fact is that yahoo and ortex data are synced. Whether they‚Äôre both correct remains to be seen. Because it‚Äôs a recent filing all the data should be updated by the end of this week.

Facts:
- According to Greenoaks Capital‚Äôs filing they recently converted their 96 million shares from Class B to Class A
- CLOV‚Äôs 10k states Class B shares are classified as institutional shares, whereas Class A are common stock
- This conversion drops float from 110M to 13M while short interest remains at 38M shares
- Both Yahoo Finance and ORTEX show short interest at over 300% as of Friday afternoon",[],0

They helped publish a piece in Nat Geo last week with flimsy accusations and an accompanying call for a class action lawsuit by an ambulance chasing group called Rosen Law Firm. It's funny that Rosen is calling for ""investors with losses"" to inquire about a class action when the stock has basically only been on a positive trajectory for the past year or so. In other words no one has substantial losses yet which further underscores that this is part of a coordinate FUD campaign to serve the interests of the short positions out there. Should wait until the hit piece has some effect before throwing up the sham class action!

Tell me who's buying bonds at 2 or even 3% compared to investing in the actual market? Especially when the same people spreading fear about that are saying inflation will be 3%+. Your bonds will LOSE money.

I recall they mentioned that based on the phase 3 study, they were going to file for BLA late this year, so they were estimating FDA approval first half of next year if everything goes according to plan.  That was from what I recall in an investor conference earlier in the year.   No I am not a pump and dumper.  I've been in the stock since it was Nantkwest (now it's IBRX).  I had an opportunity to sell when the price was in the 40's but opted not to because I'm holding long term and to avoid high taxes for short term sales.  It's come down a long ways to a point where I think the prices are undervalued.  Yeah, with 71% complete response rate for previously failed BCG patients in bladder cancer, it will imo get the approval.  I think BCG cr rates alone were around 40-50% so a definitely a higher improvement over the current standard of care.  Other issues people may point to is their financials which with a lot of smaller biotechs is burning money.  But their owner Patrick Soon Shiong is a billionaire who actually put in 40 million of his own money last year to buy shares to help fund operations.  That is something you usually don't get with a biotech.  I'm getting the word out now because the price has dropped to levels that seem incredibly undervalued.  It was in the 40's earlier in the year and has had a big drop to 16 now.  All this dispite positive clinical trial results from the company.  They didn't have any negative news or failed trials.

But if a large amount of people bought and held shares, then the public float would decrease driving up the stock price, especially when hedgies are trying to cover their shorts.

For squeeze plays, I typically buy a few shares to help the cause, because if 10 million people bought and held say 7 shares, that would eat up 77.57% of the 90.23 million public float, which would prompt both a short squeeze and gamma squeeze. However, if the 10 million people just bought calls and no shares, all the hedgies have to do is drive the price down to collect millions in premiums every week.

tl;dr: Squeezes happen because people buy and hold shares. Calls are worthless without a diamond hand army to back them up.",[],0

**My question was:**

What is a support actually? If SP break some line and stay above that line? If don't stay above that line that's also support? What is resistance then? Based on your argument you can call any line above or below as support. Even when SP goes up and down above and below that line multiple times. You are now completely changing the meaning of support.

**Your response:**

>Since the price moves up and down - support and resistance are fluid - especially with short term trends - support can become resistance and resistance can become support. Supports and resistances are best used for determining your enter and exit points - to help you strategize your moves for the day.

**OP define support first and then discuss the properties of support!** You said support can become resistance and resistance can become support. But what is support? What is resistance? If you do not define clearly what is support first then rest of your text are pointless. Let me do the job for you from borrowing the definition from Investopedia, which you like to refer. The next paragraph is copied from Investopedia-

From here: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/support.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/support.asp)

**What Is Support?**

Support, or a support level, refers to the price level that an asset does not fall below for period of time. An asset's support level is created by buyers entering the market whenever the asset dips to a lower price. In technical analysis, the simple support level can be charted by drawing a line along the lowest lows for the time period being considered. The support line can be flat or slanted up or down with the overall price trend. Other technical indicators and charting techniques can be used to identify more advanced versions of support.

Similarly the definition of Resistance from the same source-

**What Is Resistance?**

Resistance, or a resistance level, is the price at which the price of an asset meets pressure on its way up by the emergence of a growing number of sellers who wish to sell at that price. Resistance levels can be short-lived if new information comes to light that changes the overall market‚Äôs attitude toward the asset, or they can be long-lasting. In terms of technical analysis, the simple resistance level can be charted by drawing a line along the highest highs for the time period being considered. Resistance can be contrasted with support.

**Simplify this way:** 

For the time being considered, price will be above the support level and below Resistance level.

**Why I ever asked you any questions:** 

*Because you kept referring 20 SMMA as support and then as resistance when it met the definition of neither for the time being considered. Because SPY went down that 20 SMMA level several time so it was not a support. Similarly SPY went above that level several times so it was not a resistance.*

**The definition of the support and resistance is the reason TA traders try to enter a long (i.e. call) position around support level because they believe that price will bounce up from that level and will not fall below that level. Which means he can sell his calls the way up and make profit**. But if he sees that price doing up and down from a level he will not consider it a support or resistance because that level (20 SMMA in your chart) does not meet the definition of support neither it meet the definition of resistance.

**TlDr: You wrote so much but never really answered my question.**

The guys who came in trying to turn the sub into ""WSB vs. [XYZ]"" were mostly outsiders looking to co-opt the place for their own cause (a lot of occupy wall street-types showed up in January, for example).

But WSB definitely doesn't have any sort of agenda or goal, other than to share risky, entertaining plays with each other.",['GME'],1

Anything that goes into someone's pocket comes out of some other person's pocket - that's what stock trading is about, right?  

If I buy 10000 shares at a dollar, and people get the idea they will be rich buying the same shares, demand goes up, they buy them at a higher price. Maybe they will end up paying 10 or 50 or 500 dollars (that's their judgement call).

Not my problem -  I can sell my 10000 at that high price, before they do. So I get their money.   
They lose their money.

Note: This is just talking about the 5m timeframe. Your SMMAs are going to be different on longer timeframes. This is why using multiple timeframes is very important in determining mid-term and long-term trends (with long-term trends this is why you hear ""stonks only go up"".) Look at spy longterm - it only goes up.The strength of a support is determined by how many times the prices ""bounces off it"" Same for the strength of a resistance. (I could get into top call/put strikes and max pain and other spotgamma data but I'm just really addressing SMMAs)

  
**This was one of my original questions. I asked you several times there are many variations in indicators how someone choose one because one of my main objection against TA is the lack of guideline to pick specific combinations. You wrote all these text to say what exactly? I can go one by one all of them but since none of the text really addressed my actual questions, I will touch some points-**  


You use SMMAs a lot but it appeared to me from your comments that you are not completely aware of what they are doing really. SMMA is a moving average filter and one of the parameter is the how many data points you are taking to calculate that average. You can take 20, 50, 60, 100, 150, 200 etc. If a stock or ETF or any financial instrument is on a consistent uptrend then following will be true-

  
1.	Price chart will be always above the SMMA lines except when there is a strong downtrend.  
2.	20-day SMMA will be closer to actual price movement, 50-day SMMA will be below 20-day SMMA, 100-day SMMA will be below 50-day SMMA, 1. 200-day SMMA will be below 100-day SMMA and so on.  


On a consistent downtrend, the exact opposite will be true. The larger day SMMA will be far above the instrument price. That's just the nature of the filter itself. A 200-day SMMA line is still influenced by stock price 200-days ago but a 20-day SMMA line is only affected by last 20 day price action. On a consistent uptrend a instrument price will be much smaller 200 days ago compare to 20 days ago because it's a consistent uptrend.  
For the same reason at extended consolidation period, these SMMA curves will go across the price actions. The less the number of days you take account (20 vs 60) the more it (SMMA) will be closer to actual price action.  
  
  
**What is my point here:** 

**You can not or should should not use an SMMA whether it's 20-day or 60-day as support or resistance because SMMA does not determine the price action of a financial instrument rather it's completely the other way around. Price action of a financial instrument (Stonks, ETF etc.) shape the SMMA curve/lines.** If you do not understand this ask me I can talk all day if I have time. Designing filters in Matlab or Python to analyze experimental data is what I do and have been doing most part of my life.  


**My next question was:**

  
You are saying at higher prices such as 419, 420, 422 you are bullish but you do understand that price goes higher when demand is more than supply, right? You also understand that if price goes up then RSI will also goes up, right? Which means RSI can go to overbought territory.  
Next Monday if SPY goes to $419.7 and RSI goes to 82. Now you are in bullish territory based of SPY price but RSI is indicating over bought. Will you buy call or puts? Because whatever you buy you will contradict yourself.  


**Your Response was:**  


provide bullish and bearish price targets for the day. This means that I'm trimming or taking profits if we hit those levels. I will also take profit if we are near a highlighted resistance or support level. Especially if indicators are telling me that we are overbought or oversold. If we break through resistance and find support on top of that resistance line then I'll enter back in. Inverse if bear.  
Yes. I know that RSI can go past 70. It all depends on risk management. If i'm playing 0dte and we are near oversold or overbought I will secure profits. I got kids to feed friend :)  
and  
some more text

OP, I asked you specifically with price and RSI whether you will buy calls or puts and you answered you will sell at that moment.   
When did you buy those that you are talking about selling at the condition I mentioned? Your bullish target was above $419 and bearish target was below $412 for 5/24. SPY was between $414.45 and $418.2 on Friday and closed at $414.94. It was never in your bullish or bearish territory based on the outlook you provided for 05/24 (Monday). Market is not open yet for 05/24 so when did you buy the positions you are referring to trim at my proposed price target and RSI?  


Your outlook for 05/21 was Bullish/Neutral. While SPY did gap up slightly but it was a downtrend for half of the day from the beginning of the market. The rest half was jerking off movements. It was never really bullish or bearish on that day. Now let me ask you again-  


**OP did you open position expiring on 05/24? If you did then based on what exactly? If you did not then why are you talking about taking profit for those imaginary positions that you have not bought yet?**  


Let me ask the same question with more clearly-  


**If tomorrow Monday (05/24) SPY gap up and open at $419.7 and RSI at 82 at market open, you will in bullish territory based of SPY price but RSI is indicating over bought. Will you buy call or puts? Because whatever you buy you will contradict yourself.**  


**If SPY open flat at $415 and moderate RSI at 45, you are neither in bullish territory nor in bearish based on SPY price and RSI is neither indicating over bought or oversold. Will you buy call or puts? Why?**

If you do research on the silver market there are pretty compelling reasons to try and enter in some way - if not buying silver, then mining stocks or royalty companies (and those can offer better returns).

My understanding is that in order to develop new models you have to use their proprietary language so if you ever want to stop using C3AI then you effectively loose everything you had worked on and you cannot bring in previously developed models to speed up development. These views were not expressed from a friend of a friend but rather from multiple coworkers who got trained to develop on C3AI's platform for the purpose of reviewing it for joint development efforts. This information was directed to me because I am also an ML developer. Overall, I would characterize the review as scathing, but the information above is all I am comfortable giving.

Those will always be profitable establishments and they aren‚Äôt going anywhere. What limits the two of them is they aren‚Äôt solely focused on expanding mobile gambling and igaming like Fan Duel and DKNG.

MGM‚Äôs approach is to wait for states to legalize and drop books a few months after legislation.

DraftKings plan is to establish a presence in the legislative process, and be the FIRST bookie offered in that state. 

Igaming and sportsbook market is the future of gambling and has the potential to be a $500 billion industry in the next 10 years. When people have ability to gamble from their couch they will go to the first book that was offered to them, hence, First to Market Advantage. 

Also, DKNG recognizes that the igaming and sportsbook industry is more complicated than just gambling from your phone. It is literally the next big tech, and they‚Äôre willing to make partnerships with these massive companies like ESPN, like Dish Network, possibly Fubo or Netflix to become another tech giant.

Because it is a liability, the banks must keep certain equity to the liability threshold due to regulatory requirements.

Dodging that bullet for the remainder of your life: priceless

After watching both of my brothers get taken to the cleaners from divorces (one tried to kill one of my brothers for life insurance money), I decided I was never going to get married. Could have, had several opportunities, but I shut them all down. Marriage isnt what it used to be these days. Loyalty is seen as inferiority in an egotistical society it seems. 

I did date a girl in highschool who was gorgeous. Prettiest girl I knew, everyone wanted her etc. She left me for a heroin addict... (talk about a blow to the self-esteem). 15 years passed and shes now living in a tent, missing all but a handful of teeth, and her family wants nothing to do with her.

Define $417.5 (or $418 doesn't need to be exact) as resistance and 413.25 ( or $413) as support. 

No moving average, be it simple (or smoothed whatever you call it) moving average (SMA/SMMA)  or exponential moving average dictate the price action, hence CANNOT  act as support or resistance. Price action determines how the shape of a moving average line will be.

Considering picking up more if it stays under $30 this week (always hoping for a dip on the strats I'm confident on).

4215,gz72id4,2021-05-23,t3_njaodl,wallstreetbets,"Fun story time. Grab a cold one and get ready.

I got in nearly perfectly before the initial BB hype caught on. I had 8C's + 10C's. Was even responsible and took some profits and rolled half the 10's into 15C's....I was jacked to the metaphorical tits to say the least...

I even told someone ""I've got a 1600% unrealized gain on BB calls""...the day was 1/27, shit was popping off...do you think I sold? **Nope!** Not even when it was a 2000%+ gain.

Fast forward several hours. All throughout that day I could have sold at great exit points and just taken the money and run. Even on 1/28 there were several hours where I could have taken insane gains before RobinHood did their rug pull bullshit https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-bars-users-from-buying-game-stop-stock-infuriating-its-users-144007484.html

I was aware they had blocked GME buying but because of the frenzy and my head not being clear, I didn't know they blocked BB too. Not that it would have changed anything because I'm too stupid to understand second-order effects. ""Oh, people can't buy? I can't believe it!"" is as far as my degenerate monkey brain got. 

Only afterwards was I able to understand that not being able to buy implies that people can only sell. (Or hold, but let's be real...apes together strong is bullshit, this isn't a team sport). If I didn't make the logical leap to step 2, I certainly didn't make it to step 3 which was: if people can't buy, and can only sell, then the price will go down bigly because of supply and demand.

All I needed to do was set some reasonable limit orders...or at least a stop loss. To have some kind of a plan.

But I somehow got it into my head that it could go to $40. It never even occurred to me think about *why* it was up so much and how precarious it all was. It had gone from $4...to $6...to $8...to $25+ in a matter of days. My brain thought that was somehow totally normal and it would be reasonable to not take *any* gains and to expect it to go up even more. 

Keep in mind I got in after *skimming* some DD, no reason for the position other than that and people saying ""you son of a bitch, I'm in"" -- yet somehow I fell in love with and believed deeply in a stock I had owned for only a few days and had no thesis about.


Don't be me. I couldn't imagine or internalize it at the time, but TRUST ME...*not* taking gains (or even going to $0, as I ended up doing) is MUCH MUCH MUCH more painful and psychologically damaging than missing out on potential upside. Sure, that will always feels bad and you'll kick yourself, but nowhere **near** as much as the soul-crushing regrets that will haunt you every single day afterwards forever if you don't take the money and fucking run.

If you care about yourself, your mental health, and your financial future...don't be me.",['GME'],0

This is a dip in the stock ticker of life. Buy the lesson, hold for the love squeeze, and refrain from expensive gifts until you're certain it's authentic. Find a girl who is fine with eloping or more impressed by the specialness of a  simple wedding and the shared moment it represents. The rest is just window dressing and vanity and a red flag for materialism. Use the money you would have wasted on artificially inflated diamond prices and the wedding industry to buy an experience for you both to have as a couple. An experience that you will carry with you an remember for years. Take a long vacation in another country and grow together.

Money is great, tendies are fine, but only to a certain point. The real benefit of money is control over your very short time in this world.

First of all, if the ring is not in your possession, get it back immediately!  It belongs to you, not her.  It is not a gift, it is a promise, and she broke that promise, so she is not entitled to it.  That is your money and you need it.

Secondly, in terms of the car, did you take out a loan for her?  Did you put money down?  Try to get the money back from her or get her name on the loan and get your name removed.  If she is uncooperative, contact a lawyer and find out what rights you have.  Maybe take her to small claims court.  If all else fails, just default on the loan and let the dealership repossess the car.  Just get out of it.  

Thirdly, be glad that you didn't marry her and she pulled this shit after a few months or a year of marriage, because it could be a lot worse!  

Things will work out fine for you.  I understand that it is very difficult, but trust me, you'll be ok.  Maybe stay with your parents for awhile if it is ok with them.  You can save money and you have your family close by to give you emotional support.  I give you this advice from my own experience, as well.  I went through some very hard times, but I wound up with a wonderful girl and we got married in August of 2015.

Peering gives you a warped and ""scientifically biased"" point of view. You want to examine, because you're told it's ""the right thing to do."" What you'll see is only what the microscope will let you. 

 The eagle senses all at once. The velocity of wind, the stability of the rock or branch it is positioned, the patterns of its sustenance. Their priorities aren't even a question. 
They are always where they need to be. Its in their nature. THAT IS NATURE. 

 Its knows nothing of greed, lust, envy, pride, wrath, gluttony, sloth. 

It knows nothing of ambition, yet its fierce. 
- If you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, while taking your dog for a walk, the eagle could snatch it up and there goes toto. The eagle won't think twice about your emotions. 

A person might say ""my dog was collateral damage to that SICK AND EVIL eagle."" Except, they'd sound pretty stupid, because everyone knows what an eagle IS and DOES. 

It pirches, watches..... watches... veers... senses... waits... 
Oh, and it can fly. Not too close to the sun, or to the moon, because it knows better. It mates when it has to.

6693,gz7clrg,2021-05-23,t1_gz79z78,wallstreetbets,"I've read a ton of the ""DDs"". They're all bullshit. The GME movement has been one of the biggest cases of confirmation bias I've ever seen. People can't comprehend that they lost all their money and got in late leaving them as bag holders. So you have a bunch of delusional people with zero financial/investing knowledge convincing themselves and everyone around them that they're all going to get rich quick if everyone just throws in their life savings into GME or crypto or whatever it is. 

Some people made a ton of money off it. I, myself, made thousands on the initial ride up. That ended the second RobinHood halted the momentum. Anyone who took their profits before that came out on top. Every other sucker who is now selling their car, living off ramen, has their life savings wiped out, and is now sleeping on the couch of their wife's boyfriend's house got suckered. 

People forget 2 key components of investing. Absolutely NOTHING is a sure deal. And only invest what you can afford to lose.

That first rocket from $20 to $480 was fun. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity fueled by hype, momentum, and rallying. It's over now. There is no squeeze. You're not bankrupting the hedge funds. You're not going to be the next Warren Buffet. There will be other opportunities to make money, but dont get conned by confirmation bias and ""DDs"" that aren't worth shit if you know even a shred of investing.",['GME'],0

Can make a ton of money buying options that never hit, if you know when to buy/sell.

When IV is super high, it's a good time to sell (and I've seen GME break 1,000% and 1,300% IV before on totally separate dates). When it's low, might be a good time to buy, as long as you have a firm belief on the direction the stock is going to move!

As for the administration, while they clearly don‚Äôt like fossil fuels, LNG is for overseas consumption. Many countries, even those that are developed like Korea still use a LOT of coal. In countries like India, the need for LNG to reduce emissions and provide for a low cost energy source is drastically greater. These are facts and issues that the administration can not ignore. And while they don‚Äôt like to admit it, they do realize that not every energy transition is going to be at the same level.

In my experience, and observation, long-dated options are way less of a gamble, as a stock can move consistently toward the strike/goal OR all at once do some short term crazy thing in favor of the option, and be profitable either way. Especially when IV is low.

Generally I prefer the thetagang strat for options (selling to the degenerates of WSB, as they say, especially when IV is high), but occasionally I see an opportunity to go long on an option, generally calls.

They promised better pricing and features.  They skipped over details like specification price points, and that availability isn't expected to start for a year (Spring '22 = as late as May).  Specifications won't be defined by Ford until Fall, and they will surely make the $90k models first.

9010,gz7kbgm,2021-05-23,t3_nje1e9,wallstreetbets,"I feel for you man.  I went through something similar except that I was with the girl for like 8 years.  A few bits of advice:

1. Give yourself time.  The pain/suffering will last the sooner of   
   a)  1 year    
   b)  First hotter/better looking girl you date
2. Focus on 1B and optimize your left to make more 1Bs happen.   This means go to the gym, make new friends, go out more and put yourself out there more, and travel.  
3. While focusing on #1b and #2, date with good intentions and be a decent human being.  Don't be one of those dicks who just goes out on rebound carnages and destroys others in the process.  Unless told otherwise, the women who are dating you are dating for something real and long term.  Women are not objects, they weren't created for your taking, and their time is just as valuable as yours, if not more so because you don't have a ticking biological clock -- DONT WASTE THEIR TIME.  If it's something purely physical, be upfront about it otherwise you are scamming them and that makes you a shit human being.
4. Focus on building/improving wealth for yourself.  A good woman and at least the hopes of making good money does wonders for rebuilding your self confidence.  The improved self confidence creates a positive vicious cycle on your personal and professional life
5. DO NOT contact or write your ex -- especially some heartfelt manifesto pouring out your love and emotions in a letter/email trying to win back your love.  This is a very common and male thing to do as we think we can negotiate or rationalize our way through anything because that's how our brains work.  Women are much more complex than us and on matters of the heart, they cannot be convinced and/or negotiated back to a previous state.  Basically, if she broke it off with you she is 100%, irreversibly beyond the point of return done with you, and she likely has already moved on to someone else or has her eye on someone else.  The sooner you accept this and make peace with it, the sooner the healing in #1 will happen.
6. Get the fucking ring back and sell it for a fraction of the money if you have to and put it into some LEAPS to try to claw back your losses.  If you lose that too, fuck it.  It's 10k, you'll make it back.  Dont hold on to the ring like some memento of a former empire that crumbled.  It's bad energy, you don't need it around.  Also, $2500 is better than $0.  DO NOT HANG ONTO IT WITH HOPES THAT YOU WILL USE IT ON ANOTHER GIRL (THIS IS A BSOD).  
7. Remind yourself every day that you could have had it A LOT WORSE.  You could have have kids, and you could have had alimony.  The car payments and loss on the ring is like a fender bender compared to getting t-boned by train wreck that you were headed towards if you actually got married.  
8. Take a video of yourself in a mirror and say 'this is me at one of my lowest points in my life'.  Save the video, don't look, not even once, for 3 years
9. Remind yourself that every bad thing in life creates ripples and good handful of those ripples also create good into your life that you never expected.  Likewise, every good thing in your life also create bad ripples.  The point with this is that a wise person who has been around the block a few times knows that good things lead to bad things and bad things lead to good things so know that although this feels like betrayal, it feels like your world got turned upside down, and it may feel like a blow to your self worth IT'S TEMPORARY and IT WILL LEAD TO GOOD THINGS.

I believe in god and general christian values, but chances are that the concept of hell was just made up to scare people into following the rules and paying shitty priests for forgiveness back in the day.

9062,gz7kitx,2021-05-23,t3_njfshj,wallstreetbets,"Zim is a trader and he has a proven technique that works and makes him money. He says that it doesn't always work but most of the time it does work. Let's say most of the times means 60% (that's barely a most)

Zim started trading using his technique with $1K capital. He just makes one trade with a day with options and then stops. He is not greedy and very disciplined. He takes profit at 30% and cut his loses at 10%. So he makes a total of 200 trades in a year and 120 of them are winners. So he made-

**$1000\*(1.3)\^120 = $47,119,673,969,698,375.12 = 47,119,673.9 billion!**

Nope too much he does not have time to do 1 trading everyday. He only makes 1 trade a week. So he made 50 trades in the whole year and 30 of them are winners. So, he made-

**$1000\*(1.3)\^30 = $2,619,995.64 = 2.6 millions.** 

Not bad! I mean some people makes millions within a good month here gambling but Zim did that with extreme dedications and discipline. Bravo Zim. 

Now Zim loses the rest 20 trades. So, by the end of the year his actual balance becomes

**$2,619,995\*(0.9)\^20 = 318,530.30 = $318.5K**

That's like 31853% gain! Okay let's say Zim could not get out of his losing positions at 10% due to rapid fall. Let's say his loses were 20% (see I can say the same thing about the rapid rises where his market order could be sold at much higher price than 30%). Anyway 20% loss is then. Let's recalculate-

**$2,619,995\*(0.8)\^20 = $30,206 = $30.2K**

Well this looks kind of believable although it's 3020% yearly return!

Now at 3020% yearly return, making a single trade in a week, starting with only 1K, taking profit at 30% only and cutting loses at 20%, with only 60% winning rate how much money he can make in 10 years? Let's see here-

**$30206\*(30.20)\^9 = $631,183,597,920,198,084.43 =$ $631,183,597 billions!**

Fun question what is the GDP of the whole world? 

**Well, you may say Zim is good at money management he take out 80% of the balance out of the market every year. Fair enough. After the 1st year he took out 80% of 30.2K and just started trading with rest $6040 and kept withdrawing 80% after each year. Let's see what happens now on 2nd year he makes-**

**$6040\*30.20= $182408 = $182.4K** 

he then take out 145.92K and start trading with the rest. After 10 years he will have-

**$36481 \* (30.2)\^8 \* (0.2)\^7 = $ 323,096,495,781.17 = $323 billions**

This is just the money he will have as balance in his trading account excluding 80% withdrawal every year. 

I want to be Zim. Give me a strategy with only 60% winning rate. That 60% has to be with every 100 trades. If you tell me that it works 60% but I have to make 287622548752547442 trades to get 60% then you know you are bullshitting. 

&#x200B;

**There is no technique, no set up, no system that can make 60% profit consistently when the sample size are limited like 1000 trades or 10000 trades or even 100 billion trades. If there is such strategy then you can write a program implementing that algorithm and be the world's largest person within years.**",[],0

9947,gz7n5wk,2021-05-23,t3_nig7e9,wallstreetbets,">How can we know this for sure? The NYSE literally cannot quote stock prices that high. Furthermore, the SEC and politicians literally think it is their job to reduce market volatility. When Gme went to $300 the White House got involved, there is no way they will let it go to $10,000 - much less $10,000,000.

Well, BRK-A is currently approximately $430,000/share so it can go to at least six digits. What makes you think it can't go higher?

>Think about it: would any president allow the economy to crash over a video game company? 

I'm pretty sure there's a lot of DD on this already saying even at a 1m/share payout, the overall economy would be just fine.

You do you. I don't think it'll go to 10m/share either but I don't think you're talking from any place of knowledge.",[],0
