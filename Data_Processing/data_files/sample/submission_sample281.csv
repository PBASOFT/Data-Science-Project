Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",[],0
1,2021-05-19,ngg05f,wallstreetbets,"Ever since the Feb peak, the sell pressure has been high and news pieces coming out one after another to give investors reason to sell. Sector rotation, tech bubble fear, jump in 10-year treasury rate marked the beginning of inflation fear. And mistrust in FED that JPOW will not raise interest rate until at least 2023.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen. 

At the same time, the indexes are still hover around all time high. Remember how excited this sub was when SPY edging $400 and we are now still at $410. Meanwhile small growth stocks have 5% - 10% up and down days regularly and overall down 30% - 50% from ATH. 

The pre-market can be deeply red and the day can end slightly green or close to it like today.  Market can reverse anytime in any direction like playing Uno reverse card. 

The world is still hella messy. Fear of second covid wave in Europe, Asia, and even America. Big government wants to spend trillions of dollars. More spending and more stimulus so the market should go up right? Wait a second, how about inflation?

4,2021-05-19,nggpql,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

7,2021-05-19,nghmhm,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",[],0

As with every investment there is always downside risk! The downside risk here could be from many different factors, however, these are less likely and at current corn prices already priced in. 
These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil. 
-The absence of supply chain disruptions which, let‚Äôs face it, is not the theme so far in 2021.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present

However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

**SPY Results:**

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

1348,2021-05-19,ng99i7,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. 

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

Now lets look at Hindenburg, who are always going after any company looking to short. They have thousands of followers who will jump the ship and short it as well. Its funny how when GME took the squeeze they called it market manipulation, and came after US. Our CEO had to go on LIVES with news reporters, senate, and all else. But when they do this, it is not manipulation. Its part of the broken and corrupt system. 

Anyways, if you listened to the CLOV earning call and this fraudulent report. You will see that they twist words just to manipulate the market and guess what? The SEC will never do anything.

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

1369,2021-05-19,ngfajd,wallstreetbets,"Alright ladies and gentlemen.... mostly just gentlemen. Hopefully y'all ain't gentle because this time we going HARD! I will be talking about Switch. A company that provides data centers to some of the world's most secure clientele.

  
What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

1374,2021-05-19,ngftx1,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

1375,2021-05-19,ngg05f,wallstreetbets,"Ever since the Feb peak, the sell pressure has been high and news pieces coming out one after another to give investors reason to sell. Sector rotation, tech bubble fear, jump in 10-year treasury rate marked the beginning of inflation fear. And mistrust in FED that JPOW will not raise interest rate until at least 2023.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen. 

At the same time, the indexes are still hover around all time high. Remember how excited this sub was when SPY edging $400 and we are now still at $410. Meanwhile small growth stocks have 5% - 10% up and down days regularly and overall down 30% - 50% from ATH.

1378,2021-05-19,nggpql,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

1381,2021-05-19,nghmhm,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",[],0

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter.

* 410 really needs to hold for bulls. 
* We could see a battle at 410 as pointed out  at around 4/13
* If 410 fails look for 407.70 - 406.65 - 405 - 404.02
* Major support at 400. 
* Best case for bears is that we gap down below 410 and test for new resistance in the AM.

1. WHO grows corn?
The 2 leading producers of corn include the US at 1 and China at 2 that is over 50% of total production. 
2. WHO consumes Corn?

As with every investment there is always downside risk! The downside risk here could be from many different factors, however, these are less likely and at current corn prices already priced in. 
These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

3766,2021-05-19,ng64vr,wallstreetbets,"Just a quick heads up, retards! We are getting famous! My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

I hope, you‚Äôre happy now, u/memetron9000!

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

3776,2021-05-19,ng99i7,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. 

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

PS The list also contained companies Codiak BioSciences and Dynavax Technologies, but the bot did not pass them through due to weak capitalization. Although in my opinion, they are the most promising among all mentioned above.

Perhaps this analysis is an obvious thing and many have published it, but maybe someone will find it valuable

3801,2021-05-19,ngftx1,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",[],0
3802,2021-05-19,ngg05f,wallstreetbets,"Ever since the Feb peak, the sell pressure has been high and news pieces coming out one after another to give investors reason to sell. Sector rotation, tech bubble fear, jump in 10-year treasury rate marked the beginning of inflation fear. And mistrust in FED that JPOW will not raise interest rate until at least 2023.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen. 

At the same time, the indexes are still hover around all time high. Remember how excited this sub was when SPY edging $400 and we are now still at $410. Meanwhile small growth stocks have 5% - 10% up and down days regularly and overall down 30% - 50% from ATH.

3805,2021-05-19,nggpql,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

3807,2021-05-19,nghmhm,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",[],0

4209,2021-05-18,nfl4hi,wallstreetbets,"I'm copying the abstract of the paper (Bradley et al. 2021 WP) -- don't blame me on that.

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit‚Äôs Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‚Äòbuy‚Äô recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

To complete, we need a bounce around 405-410 bottom and to cross 417.86 range. I believe if we cross 417.86 we will see all time highs in the near future. Bulls have a lot of work to do though.

These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

4242,2021-05-19,ng64vr,wallstreetbets,"Just a quick heads up, retards! We are getting famous! My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

I hope, you‚Äôre happy now, u/memetron9000!

**SPY Results:**

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

4252,2021-05-19,ng99i7,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. 

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

4277,2021-05-19,ngftx1,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",[],0
4278,2021-05-19,ngg05f,wallstreetbets,"Ever since the Feb peak, the sell pressure has been high and news pieces coming out one after another to give investors reason to sell.

4281,2021-05-19,nggpql,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

4283,2021-05-19,nghmhm,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",[],0

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit‚Äôs Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‚Äòbuy‚Äô recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter.

1D Timeframe

* If bears continue putting the pressure and we close 410-405 tomorrow the w seems to be forming and nearer to completion. To complete, we need a bounce around 405-410 bottom and to cross 417.86 range. I believe if we cross 417.86 we will see all time highs in the near future. Bulls have a lot of work to do though.

BEFORE you make any investment decision in Corn, let‚Äôs run through these important things:
1. WHO grows corn?
The 2 leading producers of corn include the US at 1 and China at 2 that is over 50% of total production. 
2. WHO consumes Corn?

These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

I hope, you‚Äôre happy now, u/memetron9000!

**SPY Results:**

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

4776,2021-05-19,ng99i7,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. 

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

4801,2021-05-19,ngftx1,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",[],0
4802,2021-05-19,ngg05f,wallstreetbets,"Ever since the Feb peak, the sell pressure has been high and news pieces coming out one after another to give investors reason to sell.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

4805,2021-05-19,nggpql,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

4807,2021-05-19,nghmhm,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",[],0

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit‚Äôs Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‚Äòbuy‚Äô recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter.

1D Timeframe

* If bears continue putting the pressure and we close 410-405 tomorrow the w seems to be forming and nearer to completion. To complete, we need a bounce around 405-410 bottom and to cross 417.86 range. I believe if we cross 417.86 we will see all time highs in the near future. Bulls have a lot of work to do though.

* 410 really needs to hold for bulls. 
* We could see a battle at 410 as pointed out  at around 4/13
* If 410 fails look for 407.70 - 406.65 - 405 - 404.02

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

5008,2021-05-19,ng64vr,wallstreetbets,"Just a quick heads up, retards! We are getting famous! My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

I hope, you‚Äôre happy now, u/memetron9000!

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

5018,2021-05-19,ng99i7,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. 

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

5043,2021-05-19,ngftx1,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",[],0

5047,2021-05-19,nggpql,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

5049,2021-05-19,nghmhm,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",[],0

Most of what's on CNBC is entertainment or whatever obvious thing is happening in the world of boomer market makers. But sometimes there's a nice nugget of info to play with. I think there was one yesterday.

On Fast Money, after the segment with the chart guy, Nadine Terman of Solstein capital says (around 7:55 on the YT video, no link because mods will remove the post) that there was a possible ""hedge fund breaking down"" adding to the volatility yesterday. It's pretty clear that this isn't Archegos or Citadel level yet, but something to watch out for.

Corn the US crop that has had its highs and lows over a long history but continues to have massive demand worldwide for a variety of uses and it is not slowing. Instead, weather risks, drought risks, execution risks, and other supply chain bottlenecks have impacts on the prices in the short and mid term and sometimes the long term. 
BEFORE you make any investment decision in Corn, let‚Äôs run through these important things:
1. WHO grows corn?
The 2 leading producers of corn include the US at 1 and China at 2 that is over 50% of total production. 
2. WHO consumes Corn?
Well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs The US and China accounting for over 50% of total consumption 
3.WHO is the top exporter?
The US is the top exporter
4.WHO is top importer?
China is the top importer by far (Mexico was for years until this year and commitments for next year)
5. Risks?
As with every investment there is always downside risk! The downside risk here could be from many different factors, however, these are less likely and at current corn prices already priced in. 
These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil. 
-The absence of supply chain disruptions which, let‚Äôs face it, is not the theme so far in 2021.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

I hope, you‚Äôre happy now, u/memetron9000!

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

5838,2021-05-19,ng99i7,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. 

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",[],0

Sector rotation, tech bubble fear, jump in 10-year treasury rate marked the beginning of inflation fear. And mistrust in FED that JPOW will not raise interest rate until at least 2023.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen. 

At the same time, the indexes are still hover around all time high. Remember how excited this sub was when SPY edging $400 and we are now still at $410. Meanwhile small growth stocks have 5% - 10% up and down days regularly and overall down 30% - 50% from ATH.

5867,2021-05-19,nggpql,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

5869,2021-05-19,nghmhm,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",[],0

Most of what's on CNBC is entertainment or whatever obvious thing is happening in the world of boomer market makers. But sometimes there's a nice nugget of info to play with. I think there was one yesterday.

The question is this:  We know UWMC  is paying 5.5% interest on its $700b senior notes just issued and is paying 5.3% dividend on shareholders' money.  That captial is a drop in the bucket when it comes to making $54b of loans  which also are made at mortage rates of perhaps 2.5%. You can't borrow money at 5.5% and lend it at 2.5%  for long. 
Now I no stranger to REITs but people keep denying that UWMC  is a REIT. Of course it is - it just elects to be taxed as an LLC  rather than REIT.
REITs issue CMOs and all manner of instruments to raise the bulk of the cash they need to make loans and manage to contrive it in such a way that they pay lower interest rate in that borrowing than the interest received on mortgage loans. When they sell the CMOS they are moreover off-book (non-recourse) with the REIT  merely servicing them for a small fee.

The 2 leading producers of corn include the US at 1 and China at 2 that is over 50% of total production.

These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

I should have shorted it, but I'm not rich. Here are some of her stances:

She thinks gene editing is a sound investment at this time.

She has decreased her position in Netflix.

I think that the increase size of her fund will continue to limit her ability to invest in anything interesting.

6192,2021-05-19,ngfajd,wallstreetbets,"Alright ladies and gentlemen.... mostly just gentlemen. Hopefully y'all ain't gentle because this time we going HARD! I will be talking about Switch. A company that provides data centers to some of the world's most secure clientele.

  
What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",[],0

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount.

#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards

TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months.

6203,2021-05-19,nghmhm,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",[],0

Most of what's on CNBC is entertainment or whatever obvious thing is happening in the world of boomer market makers. But sometimes there's a nice nugget of info to play with. I think there was one yesterday.

On Fast Money, after the segment with the chart guy, Nadine Terman of Solstein capital says (around 7:55 on the YT video, no link because mods will remove the post) that there was a possible ""hedge fund breaking down"" adding to the volatility yesterday. It's pretty clear that this isn't Archegos or Citadel level yet, but something to watch out for.

The question is this:  We know UWMC  is paying 5.5% interest on its $700b senior notes just issued and is paying 5.3% dividend on shareholders' money.  That captial is a drop in the bucket when it comes to making $54b of loans  which also are made at mortage rates of perhaps 2.5%. You can't borrow money at 5.5% and lend it at 2.5%  for long. 
Now I no stranger to REITs but people keep denying that UWMC  is a REIT. Of course it is - it just elects to be taxed as an LLC  rather than REIT.
REITs issue CMOs and all manner of instruments to raise the bulk of the cash they need to make loans and manage to contrive it in such a way that they pay lower interest rate in that borrowing than the interest received on mortgage loans. When they sell the CMOS they are moreover off-book (non-recourse) with the REIT  merely servicing them for a small fee.

Can somebody point to where UWMC is doing the same,  or what are they doing to get $54b of cash at less than mortgage rate. Are they selling bundles of loans to Freddie Mac or what?",[],0

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

6593,2021-05-19,ng50po,wallstreetbets,"Gold is for the most part useless. Similar to other nameless 'inflation hedges' that provide almost 0 current real world value. Might as well be beanie babies. However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

6599,2021-05-19,ng64vr,wallstreetbets,"Just a quick heads up, retards! We are getting famous! My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

6609,2021-05-19,ng99i7,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now.

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

6634,2021-05-19,ngftx1,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",[],0
6635,2021-05-19,ngg05f,wallstreetbets,"Ever since the Feb peak, the sell pressure has been high and news pieces coming out one after another to give investors reason to sell. Sector rotation, tech bubble fear, jump in 10-year treasury rate marked the beginning of inflation fear. And mistrust in FED that JPOW will not raise interest rate until at least 2023.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen. 

At the same time, the indexes are still hover around all time high. Remember how excited this sub was when SPY edging $400 and we are now still at $410. Meanwhile small growth stocks have 5% - 10% up and down days regularly and overall down 30% - 50% from ATH. 

The pre-market can be deeply red and the day can end slightly green or close to it like today.  Market can reverse anytime in any direction like playing Uno reverse card. 

The world is still hella messy. Fear of second covid wave in Europe, Asia, and even America. Big government wants to spend trillions of dollars. More spending and more stimulus so the market should go up right? Wait a second, how about inflation?

6638,2021-05-19,nggpql,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

6640,2021-05-19,nghmhm,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",[],0

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

Most of what's on CNBC is entertainment or whatever obvious thing is happening in the world of boomer market makers. But sometimes there's a nice nugget of info to play with. I think there was one yesterday.

On Fast Money, after the segment with the chart guy, Nadine Terman of Solstein capital says (around 7:55 on the YT video, no link because mods will remove the post) that there was a possible ""hedge fund breaking down"" adding to the volatility yesterday. It's pretty clear that this isn't Archegos or Citadel level yet, but something to watch out for.

The question is this:  We know UWMC  is paying 5.5% interest on its $700b senior notes just issued and is paying 5.3% dividend on shareholders' money.  That captial is a drop in the bucket when it comes to making $54b of loans  which also are made at mortage rates of perhaps 2.5%. You can't borrow money at 5.5% and lend it at 2.5%  for long. 
Now I no stranger to REITs but people keep denying that UWMC  is a REIT. Of course it is - it just elects to be taxed as an LLC  rather than REIT.
REITs issue CMOs and all manner of instruments to raise the bulk of the cash they need to make loans and manage to contrive it in such a way that they pay lower interest rate in that borrowing than the interest received on mortgage loans. When they sell the CMOS they are moreover off-book (non-recourse) with the REIT  merely servicing them for a small fee.

Can somebody point to where UWMC is doing the same,  or what are they doing to get $54b of cash at less than mortgage rate. Are they selling bundles of loans to Freddie Mac or what?",[],0

Please don't blame especially silver owners because they are waiting 10 years this moment to come  and what a wonderful to hear from : 

From  Fed  :""A number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and, if so, these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year.""

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

7307,2021-05-19,ng64vr,wallstreetbets,"Just a quick heads up, retards! We are getting famous! My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

I hope, you‚Äôre happy now, u/memetron9000!

**SPY Results:**

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

7317,2021-05-19,ng99i7,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. 

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

7342,2021-05-19,ngftx1,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",[],0
7343,2021-05-19,ngg05f,wallstreetbets,"Ever since the Feb peak, the sell pressure has been high and news pieces coming out one after another to give investors reason to sell. Sector rotation, tech bubble fear, jump in 10-year treasury rate marked the beginning of inflation fear. And mistrust in FED that JPOW will not raise interest rate until at least 2023.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

7346,2021-05-19,nggpql,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

7348,2021-05-19,nghmhm,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",[],0

Most of what's on CNBC is entertainment or whatever obvious thing is happening in the world of boomer market makers. But sometimes there's a nice nugget of info to play with. I think there was one yesterday.

On Fast Money, after the segment with the chart guy, Nadine Terman of Solstein capital says (around 7:55 on the YT video, no link because mods will remove the post) that there was a possible ""hedge fund breaking down"" adding to the volatility yesterday. It's pretty clear that this isn't Archegos or Citadel level yet, but something to watch out for.

The question is this:  We know UWMC  is paying 5.5% interest on its $700b senior notes just issued and is paying 5.3% dividend on shareholders' money.  That captial is a drop in the bucket when it comes to making $54b of loans  which also are made at mortage rates of perhaps 2.5%. You can't borrow money at 5.5% and lend it at 2.5%  for long. 
Now I no stranger to REITs but people keep denying that UWMC  is a REIT. Of course it is - it just elects to be taxed as an LLC  rather than REIT.
REITs issue CMOs and all manner of instruments to raise the bulk of the cash they need to make loans and manage to contrive it in such a way that they pay lower interest rate in that borrowing than the interest received on mortgage loans.

7362,2021-05-20,ngn7j2,wallstreetbets," Measurable data leads to one inescapable conclusion: 

The Fed is the enemy of the bottom 50% & the friend of the top 1%. It rewards those with access to large capital & it punishes those that don‚Äôt with price distortions in the real economy. 

 

Let me start with I am one of the bottom 50 % : But this time ,this bottom 50 % wil get the rewards .

Let's start with Fundamentals ,then dig our mistakes and try not to repeat again ,and lastly final count down : Tic Toc :

1- Fundamental : What is the real story today  ? 

Reverse repo usage just surpassed Covid crash highs. We are effectively out of repo market collateral, Fed is cornered, and there is no place to park $1TN more in reserves.

The market understood this harsh reality : Fed can't do 18 more months of QE;

2. Our last days favorite subject : Somebodies call it beast , somebody says transitory , but I call it my best friend  ""INFLATION "" 

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

In fact this is a reality that all of us knows , but until now Fed always insist to use TRANSITORY . Because ƒ±nflation is something that you do not see . Inflation is something that you feel . I am sure all of us less or more were feeling in last days . 

SO HEADLINE FOR METAL OWNERS : FED ADMITTED THAT INFLATION MAY NOT BE TRANSITORY 

Please don't blame especially silver owners because they are waiting 10 years this moment to come  and what a wonderful to hear from : 

From  Fed  :""A number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and, if so, these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year.""

 Assuming you are in the right form of Silver investment , Lets dig on silver ( right form of silver allocated Silver ETFS( PSLV , ZSƒ∞L )  plus all kind of silver bars , coins , junk whatever shinny staff ) 

"" It is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions. ""

Now we are ready as 50 % bottom to soar while inflation our best friend already here , yields are not increasing due to above reasons 

&#x200B;

Sƒ∞LVER THE INVESTMENT OF DECADE NOW FULLY READY : 

 There are many ways to mess things up even if one is right on the larger trend. This Silver bull market  is the true opportunity of our lifetime. The real one. And it is here since 12.5 months. Set aside time to learn. Don¬¥t mess this up. And don¬¥t wake up to it in 2 years time. 

We got the big breakout last week, this week  using closing prices.  I am expecting [$SILVER](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SILVER&src=cashtag_click) to move at least 10x from here in long term , which means that silver juniors will move 30x - 40x from here, with the best moving way over 100x.  This is life-changing money if played right.

 I think that is what we have here for silver. It has charged itself for a good move now. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN? Now  we are in 9 th month so Tƒ∞C TOC

 SILVER MARKET MANIPULATION  AND HOW WE CAN USE FOR 50 % BOTTOM ADVANTAGEOUS ;

The silver market is one of the most toxic of all. Heavily manipulated and with bullion banks now being 700 million oz of silver short on Comex and with no liquidity in London .

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present

However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

8222,2021-05-19,ng99i7,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. 

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

8242,2021-05-19,ngfajd,wallstreetbets,"Alright ladies and gentlemen.... mostly just gentlemen. Hopefully y'all ain't gentle because this time we going HARD! I will be talking about Switch. A company that provides data centers to some of the world's most secure clientele.

  
What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",[],0

Sector rotation, tech bubble fear, jump in 10-year treasury rate marked the beginning of inflation fear. And mistrust in FED that JPOW will not raise interest rate until at least 2023.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

8253,2021-05-19,nghmhm,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",[],0

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

Most of what's on CNBC is entertainment or whatever obvious thing is happening in the world of boomer market makers. But sometimes there's a nice nugget of info to play with. I think there was one yesterday.

On Fast Money, after the segment with the chart guy, Nadine Terman of Solstein capital says (around 7:55 on the YT video, no link because mods will remove the post) that there was a possible ""hedge fund breaking down"" adding to the volatility yesterday. It's pretty clear that this isn't Archegos or Citadel level yet, but something to watch out for.

8265,2021-05-20,ngmtae,wallstreetbets,"So nobody will answer me, just calling me names,  suggesting they don't have an answer either.
The question is this:  We know UWMC  is paying 5.5% interest on its $700b senior notes just issued and is paying 5.3% dividend on shareholders' money.  That captial is a drop in the bucket when it comes to making $54b of loans  which also are made at mortage rates of perhaps 2.5%. You can't borrow money at 5.5% and lend it at 2.5%  for long. 
Now I no stranger to REITs but people keep denying that UWMC  is a REIT. Of course it is - it just elects to be taxed as an LLC  rather than REIT.
REITs issue CMOs and all manner of instruments to raise the bulk of the cash they need to make loans and manage to contrive it in such a way that they pay lower interest rate in that borrowing than the interest received on mortgage loans. When they sell the CMOS they are moreover off-book (non-recourse) with the REIT  merely servicing them for a small fee.

Can somebody point to where UWMC is doing the same,  or what are they doing to get $54b of cash at less than mortgage rate. Are they selling bundles of loans to Freddie Mac or what?",[],0

2. Our last days favorite subject : Somebodies call it beast , somebody says transitory , but I call it my best friend  ""INFLATION "" 

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

In fact this is a reality that all of us knows , but until now Fed always insist to use TRANSITORY . Because ƒ±nflation is something that you do not see . Inflation is something that you feel . I am sure all of us less or more were feeling in last days . 

SO HEADLINE FOR METAL OWNERS : FED ADMITTED THAT INFLATION MAY NOT BE TRANSITORY 

Please don't blame especially silver owners because they are waiting 10 years this moment to come  and what a wonderful to hear from : 

From  Fed  :""A number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and, if so, these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year.""

We got the big breakout last week, this week  using closing prices.  I am expecting [$SILVER](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SILVER&src=cashtag_click) to move at least 10x from here in long term , which means that silver juniors will move 30x - 40x from here, with the best moving way over 100x.

Many remember the battle of 8.01, a truly ground breaking end to a week, but few mention the battle of 14.01 on March 19th. The day those sons of bitches bar coded AMC between 14.01 and 13.99 only to end the day short at 13.97. This day was hard for me as I had slowly become more and more invested in the end of week battles, adding as much as I could from my dry powder that I was able. I contributed a large portion into the battle for 14.01, and we had lost. 
The following weeks the dip kept dipping, and ya boy kept buying. Averaging down from 13.82 to 11.20. Fast forward to this week, awesome gains, the hope of a squeeze on the horizon tickling my ball sack. This is it, the big one. Finally. Just when I thought maybe I was going crazy, buying dip after dip. Now here we are.....
Luckily for me my average price point is still low (12.30) and I will continue to buy.

What I‚Äôm trying to say is, buying these massive dips only makes our positions stronger and the squeeze more likely. If you bought at the peaks, buy the dips, your position will thank you.

If you truly believe in the squeeze, buying the dip should be nothing short of muscle memory. I have exited all other positions except AMC and GME. The only positions that matter. If this last week got you hard as a rock, this possible multi day dip should have you climaxing. We just got the membership fee discount on AMC today. We might be getting the employee discount next week. Just keep buying with the rest of us and all will be history when we roll our Lambos coast to coast in an AMC/GME share holder drive.

8676,2021-05-19,ng50po,wallstreetbets,"Gold is for the most part useless. Similar to other nameless 'inflation hedges' that provide almost 0 current real world value. Might as well be beanie babies. However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

8682,2021-05-19,ng64vr,wallstreetbets,"Just a quick heads up, retards! We are getting famous! My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

I hope, you‚Äôre happy now, u/memetron9000!

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

8692,2021-05-19,ng99i7,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now.

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

From the minute I heard the interview I realized that this person had no clue what she was talking about. To the credit of the Podcast hosts they mentioned that ARKK would have issues with outflows leading to lower stock prices in a later Podcast, which they have. I should have shorted it, but I'm not rich. Here are some of her stances:

&#x200B;

She predicts CoinBit $500,000.

She is all-in on Tesla.

She thinks gene editing is a sound investment at this time.

She has decreased her position in Netflix.

&#x200B;

I think that the increase size of her fund will continue to limit her ability to invest in anything interesting. The longshots in her portfolio which have had massive success are often successful because her fund's investment has massively increased their market cap.  She has also tied herself so tightly to Tesla that she can never hop off that ride. She's tied to the autopilot whether it goes to the moon or into a tree. I'm not denying that she has had good results during this bull market, but I think a fund that goes the other direction will do very well over the next 5 years.

8712,2021-05-19,ngfajd,wallstreetbets,"Alright ladies and gentlemen.... mostly just gentlemen. Hopefully y'all ain't gentle because this time we going HARD! I will be talking about Switch. A company that provides data centers to some of the world's most secure clientele.

  
What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

8717,2021-05-19,ngftx1,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",[],0
8718,2021-05-19,ngg05f,wallstreetbets,"Ever since the Feb peak, the sell pressure has been high and news pieces coming out one after another to give investors reason to sell. Sector rotation, tech bubble fear, jump in 10-year treasury rate marked the beginning of inflation fear. And mistrust in FED that JPOW will not raise interest rate until at least 2023.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen. 

At the same time, the indexes are still hover around all time high. Remember how excited this sub was when SPY edging $400 and we are now still at $410. Meanwhile small growth stocks have 5% - 10% up and down days regularly and overall down 30% - 50% from ATH. 

The pre-market can be deeply red and the day can end slightly green or close to it like today.  Market can reverse anytime in any direction like playing Uno reverse card. 

The world is still hella messy. Fear of second covid wave in Europe, Asia, and even America. Big government wants to spend trillions of dollars. More spending and more stimulus so the market should go up right? Wait a second, how about inflation?

8721,2021-05-19,nggpql,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

8723,2021-05-19,nghmhm,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",[],0

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

1) Earnings report on 5/24 AH: Confirmation of late Q3 production and disclosure of binding orders have a high probability of being announced.

2) Lordstown Week (June 21-25): Plant open house for tours, test drives, etc., and above all else, transparency.  This should alone should put the final nail in the shorts coffin.

Most of what's on CNBC is entertainment or whatever obvious thing is happening in the world of boomer market makers. But sometimes there's a nice nugget of info to play with. I think there was one yesterday.

On Fast Money, after the segment with the chart guy, Nadine Terman of Solstein capital says (around 7:55 on the YT video, no link because mods will remove the post) that there was a possible ""hedge fund breaking down"" adding to the volatility yesterday. It's pretty clear that this isn't Archegos or Citadel level yet, but something to watch out for. 

Personal take: I'd have cash on hand short-term (until end of summer) to take advantage of extended volatility and wait for PowPow to either put his foot down or start anti-stimmy talks.

8735,2021-05-20,ngmtae,wallstreetbets,"So nobody will answer me, just calling me names,  suggesting they don't have an answer either.
The question is this:  We know UWMC  is paying 5.5% interest on its $700b senior notes just issued and is paying 5.3% dividend on shareholders' money.  That captial is a drop in the bucket when it comes to making $54b of loans  which also are made at mortage rates of perhaps 2.5%. You can't borrow money at 5.5% and lend it at 2.5%  for long. 
Now I no stranger to REITs but people keep denying that UWMC  is a REIT. Of course it is - it just elects to be taxed as an LLC  rather than REIT.
REITs issue CMOs and all manner of instruments to raise the bulk of the cash they need to make loans and manage to contrive it in such a way that they pay lower interest rate in that borrowing than the interest received on mortgage loans. When they sell the CMOS they are moreover off-book (non-recourse) with the REIT  merely servicing them for a small fee.

Can somebody point to where UWMC is doing the same,  or what are they doing to get $54b of cash at less than mortgage rate. Are they selling bundles of loans to Freddie Mac or what?",[],0

The Fed is the enemy of the bottom 50% & the friend of the top 1%. It rewards those with access to large capital & it punishes those that don‚Äôt with price distortions in the real economy. 

 

Let me start with I am one of the bottom 50 % : But this time ,this bottom 50 % wil get the rewards .

Let's start with Fundamentals ,then dig our mistakes and try not to repeat again ,and lastly final count down : Tic Toc :

1- Fundamental : What is the real story today  ? 

Reverse repo usage just surpassed Covid crash highs. We are effectively out of repo market collateral, Fed is cornered, and there is no place to park $1TN more in reserves.

2. Our last days favorite subject : Somebodies call it beast , somebody says transitory , but I call it my best friend  ""INFLATION "" 

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

In fact this is a reality that all of us knows , but until now Fed always insist to use TRANSITORY . Because ƒ±nflation is something that you do not see . Inflation is something that you feel . I am sure all of us less or more were feeling in last days . 

SO HEADLINE FOR METAL OWNERS : FED ADMITTED THAT INFLATION MAY NOT BE TRANSITORY 

Please don't blame especially silver owners because they are waiting 10 years this moment to come  and what a wonderful to hear from : 

From  Fed  :""A number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and, if so, these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year.""

 Assuming you are in the right form of Silver investment , Lets dig on silver ( right form of silver allocated Silver ETFS( PSLV , ZSƒ∞L )  plus all kind of silver bars , coins , junk whatever shinny staff ) 

"" It is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions. ""

Now we are ready as 50 % bottom to soar while inflation our best friend already here , yields are not increasing due to above reasons

Sƒ∞LVER THE INVESTMENT OF DECADE NOW FULLY READY : 

 There are many ways to mess things up even if one is right on the larger trend. This Silver bull market  is the true opportunity of our lifetime. The real one. And it is here since 12.5 months. Set aside time to learn. Don¬¥t mess this up. And don¬¥t wake up to it in 2 years time. 

We got the big breakout last week, this week  using closing prices.  I am expecting [$SILVER](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SILVER&src=cashtag_click) to move at least 10x from here in long term , which means that silver juniors will move 30x - 40x from here, with the best moving way over 100x.  This is life-changing money if played right.

We‚Äôve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17 to $14.38 high on 5/17.  Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19 with freaky similar volume changes) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22.......

Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28.  If AMC goes on a similar slide to the March slide, there will be massive returns on these ridiculously cheap put options (9.9% decline today and the sub $10 puts barely moved in price on both the 5/21 and 5/28 expiration dates.

Cheap way to place a bet if the squeeze doesn‚Äôt materialize that could be a >10x return based on how cheap the <$10 puts are for 5/21 and 5/28 put options.

If you are holding stock, max gains you are getting for $20 is ~2x but this could be the real money maker with puts sub $10 priced at $0.01-$0.05 that could go to $0.5+ if the stock slides similar to the March slide.

I couldn‚Äôt help to ponder the past week of excitement and the absolute devastation of today. However, I have been I this situation before as many of you have.
Many remember the battle of 8.01, a truly ground breaking end to a week, but few mention the battle of 14.01 on March 19th. The day those sons of bitches bar coded AMC between 14.01 and 13.99 only to end the day short at 13.97. This day was hard for me as I had slowly become more and more invested in the end of week battles, adding as much as I could from my dry powder that I was able. I contributed a large portion into the battle for 14.01, and we had lost. 
The following weeks the dip kept dipping, and ya boy kept buying. Averaging down from 13.82 to 11.20. Fast forward to this week, awesome gains, the hope of a squeeze on the horizon tickling my ball sack. This is it, the big one. Finally. Just when I thought maybe I was going crazy, buying dip after dip. Now here we are.....
Luckily for me my average price point is still low (12.30) and I will continue to buy.

What I‚Äôm trying to say is, buying these massive dips only makes our positions stronger and the squeeze more likely. If you bought at the peaks, buy the dips, your position will thank you.

If you truly believe in the squeeze, buying the dip should be nothing short of muscle memory. I have exited all other positions except AMC and GME. The only positions that matter. If this last week got you hard as a rock, this possible multi day dip should have you climaxing. We just got the membership fee discount on AMC today. We might be getting the employee discount next week. Just keep buying with the rest of us and all will be history when we roll our Lambos coast to coast in an AMC/GME share holder drive. Thanks for the dip today Kenny G, might as well have been a rimjob it felt so good.

There are 2 more catalysts on the horizon:

1. Earnings - Monday 5/24: could always be a rug pull... or the next leg up. Fisker moved upward after their earnings, as investors got excited by the Foxconn partnership amongst other things and understood their too young of a company to have substantial figures. RIDE's coming earnings gives them to speak on some hard numbers.

However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

I hope, you‚Äôre happy now, u/memetron9000!

**SPY Results:**

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

9297,2021-05-19,ng99i7,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. 

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

9322,2021-05-19,ngftx1,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",[],0
9323,2021-05-19,ngg05f,wallstreetbets,"Ever since the Feb peak, the sell pressure has been high and news pieces coming out one after another to give investors reason to sell. Sector rotation, tech bubble fear, jump in 10-year treasury rate marked the beginning of inflation fear. And mistrust in FED that JPOW will not raise interest rate until at least 2023.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

9326,2021-05-19,nggpql,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

9328,2021-05-19,nghmhm,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",[],0

Most of what's on CNBC is entertainment or whatever obvious thing is happening in the world of boomer market makers. But sometimes there's a nice nugget of info to play with. I think there was one yesterday.

On Fast Money, after the segment with the chart guy, Nadine Terman of Solstein capital says (around 7:55 on the YT video, no link because mods will remove the post) that there was a possible ""hedge fund breaking down"" adding to the volatility yesterday. It's pretty clear that this isn't Archegos or Citadel level yet, but something to watch out for. 

Personal take: I'd have cash on hand short-term (until end of summer) to take advantage of extended volatility and wait for PowPow to either put his foot down or start anti-stimmy talks.

9338,2021-05-20,ngmtae,wallstreetbets,"So nobody will answer me, just calling me names,  suggesting they don't have an answer either.
The question is this:  We know UWMC  is paying 5.5% interest on its $700b senior notes just issued and is paying 5.3% dividend on shareholders' money.  That captial is a drop in the bucket when it comes to making $54b of loans  which also are made at mortage rates of perhaps 2.5%. You can't borrow money at 5.5% and lend it at 2.5%  for long. 
Now I no stranger to REITs but people keep denying that UWMC  is a REIT. Of course it is - it just elects to be taxed as an LLC  rather than REIT.
REITs issue CMOs and all manner of instruments to raise the bulk of the cash they need to make loans and manage to contrive it in such a way that they pay lower interest rate in that borrowing than the interest received on mortgage loans. When they sell the CMOS they are moreover off-book (non-recourse) with the REIT  merely servicing them for a small fee.

Can somebody point to where UWMC is doing the same,  or what are they doing to get $54b of cash at less than mortgage rate. Are they selling bundles of loans to Freddie Mac or what?",[],0
9339,2021-05-20,ngn7j2,wallstreetbets," Measurable data leads to one inescapable conclusion: 

The Fed is the enemy of the bottom 50% & the friend of the top 1%. It rewards those with access to large capital & it punishes those that don‚Äôt with price distortions in the real economy. 

 

Let me start with I am one of the bottom 50 % : But this time ,this bottom 50 % wil get the rewards .

Let's start with Fundamentals ,then dig our mistakes and try not to repeat again ,and lastly final count down : Tic Toc :

1- Fundamental : What is the real story today  ? 

Reverse repo usage just surpassed Covid crash highs. We are effectively out of repo market collateral, Fed is cornered, and there is no place to park $1TN more in reserves.

2. Our last days favorite subject : Somebodies call it beast , somebody says transitory , but I call it my best friend  ""INFLATION "" 

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

In fact this is a reality that all of us knows , but until now Fed always insist to use TRANSITORY . Because ƒ±nflation is something that you do not see . Inflation is something that you feel . I am sure all of us less or more were feeling in last days . 

SO HEADLINE FOR METAL OWNERS : FED ADMITTED THAT INFLATION MAY NOT BE TRANSITORY 

Please don't blame especially silver owners because they are waiting 10 years this moment to come  and what a wonderful to hear from : 

From  Fed  :""A number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and, if so, these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year.""

 Assuming you are in the right form of Silver investment , Lets dig on silver ( right form of silver allocated Silver ETFS( PSLV , ZSƒ∞L )  plus all kind of silver bars , coins , junk whatever shinny staff ) 

"" It is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions. ""

Now we are ready as 50 % bottom to soar while inflation our best friend already here , yields are not increasing due to above reasons 

&#x200B;

Sƒ∞LVER THE INVESTMENT OF DECADE NOW FULLY READY : 

 There are many ways to mess things up even if one is right on the larger trend. This Silver bull market  is the true opportunity of our lifetime. The real one. And it is here since 12.5 months. Set aside time to learn. Don¬¥t mess this up. And don¬¥t wake up to it in 2 years time. 

We got the big breakout last week, this week  using closing prices.  I am expecting [$SILVER](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SILVER&src=cashtag_click) to move at least 10x from here in long term , which means that silver juniors will move 30x - 40x from here, with the best moving way over 100x.  This is life-changing money if played right.

 I think that is what we have here for silver. It has charged itself for a good move now. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN? Now  we are in 9 th month so Tƒ∞C TOC

 SILVER MARKET MANIPULATION  AND HOW WE CAN USE FOR 50 % BOTTOM ADVANTAGEOUS ;

The silver market is one of the most toxic of all. Heavily manipulated and with bullion banks now being 700 million oz of silver short on Comex and with no liquidity in London .

Last time there was a bull run on the stock got to the same resistance (3/11-3/18) up 42.1% to $14.54 then on 3/19 slight drop of (0.5%) that was followed up by a (10.3%) drop on 3/22 and further drops of (14.7%) on 3/23 and (15.4%) on 3/24.  

We‚Äôve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17 to $14.38 high on 5/17.  Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19 with freaky similar volume changes) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22.......

Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28.  If AMC goes on a similar slide to the March slide, there will be massive returns on these ridiculously cheap put options (9.9% decline today and the sub $10 puts barely moved in price on both the 5/21 and 5/28 expiration dates.

Cheap way to place a bet if the squeeze doesn‚Äôt materialize that could be a >10x return based on how cheap the <$10 puts are for 5/21 and 5/28 put options.

If you are holding stock, max gains you are getting for $20 is ~2x but this could be the real money maker with puts sub $10 priced at $0.01-$0.05 that could go to $0.5+ if the stock slides similar to the March slide.

However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

9779,2021-05-19,ng64vr,wallstreetbets,"Just a quick heads up, retards! We are getting famous! My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

I hope, you‚Äôre happy now, u/memetron9000!

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

9789,2021-05-19,ng99i7,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. 

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

9809,2021-05-19,ngfajd,wallstreetbets,"Alright ladies and gentlemen.... mostly just gentlemen. Hopefully y'all ain't gentle because this time we going HARD! I will be talking about Switch. A company that provides data centers to some of the world's most secure clientele.

  
What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",[],0

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

The pre-market can be deeply red and the day can end slightly green or close to it like today.  Market can reverse anytime in any direction like playing Uno reverse card. 

The world is still hella messy. Fear of second covid wave in Europe, Asia, and even America. Big government wants to spend trillions of dollars. More spending and more stimulus so the market should go up right? Wait a second, how about inflation? 

Same information, mixed understanding, and complete opposite decision on the market. So far, the sell side seems winning but the market seems to be really confused on where it should go.",[],1

9818,2021-05-19,nggpql,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

9820,2021-05-19,nghmhm,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",[],0

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

Most of what's on CNBC is entertainment or whatever obvious thing is happening in the world of boomer market makers. But sometimes there's a nice nugget of info to play with. I think there was one yesterday.

On Fast Money, after the segment with the chart guy, Nadine Terman of Solstein capital says (around 7:55 on the YT video, no link because mods will remove the post) that there was a possible ""hedge fund breaking down"" adding to the volatility yesterday. It's pretty clear that this isn't Archegos or Citadel level yet, but something to watch out for.

The question is this:  We know UWMC  is paying 5.5% interest on its $700b senior notes just issued and is paying 5.3% dividend on shareholders' money.  That captial is a drop in the bucket when it comes to making $54b of loans  which also are made at mortage rates of perhaps 2.5%. You can't borrow money at 5.5% and lend it at 2.5%  for long. 
Now I no stranger to REITs but people keep denying that UWMC  is a REIT. Of course it is - it just elects to be taxed as an LLC  rather than REIT.
REITs issue CMOs and all manner of instruments to raise the bulk of the cash they need to make loans and manage to contrive it in such a way that they pay lower interest rate in that borrowing than the interest received on mortgage loans. When they sell the CMOS they are moreover off-book (non-recourse) with the REIT  merely servicing them for a small fee.

2. Our last days favorite subject : Somebodies call it beast , somebody says transitory , but I call it my best friend  ""INFLATION "" 

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

In fact this is a reality that all of us knows , but until now Fed always insist to use TRANSITORY . Because ƒ±nflation is something that you do not see . Inflation is something that you feel . I am sure all of us less or more were feeling in last days . 

SO HEADLINE FOR METAL OWNERS : FED ADMITTED THAT INFLATION MAY NOT BE TRANSITORY 

Please don't blame especially silver owners because they are waiting 10 years this moment to come  and what a wonderful to hear from :

I am expecting [$SILVER](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SILVER&src=cashtag_click) to move at least 10x from here in long term , which means that silver juniors will move 30x - 40x from here, with the best moving way over 100x.

This Lordstown Week idea shows supreme confidence in their own legitimacy and ought to erase many doubts stemming from the short report and SEC investigation. This inspired a ton of buying pressure and bull flag after bull flag. 

There are 2 more catalysts on the horizon:

1. Earnings - Monday 5/24: could always be a rug pull... or the next leg up. Fisker moved upward after their earnings, as investors got excited by the Foxconn partnership amongst other things and understood their too young of a company to have substantial figures. RIDE's coming earnings gives them to speak on some hard numbers. ""Soft,"" speculative numbers are what they've been investigated for previously so this will shed some light, as well as any speak on any progress and projects they are working on. 
2. Lordstown Week - June 21-25: This is a full week event at their plant in Ohio. The guts of the operations will be open to the media and investors alike. the first 3 days will have media coverage. The event will include factory tours, presentations and test drives of the Endurance.

I've been waiting for a red day since I heard the news after the pop, but idk if there will be one between now and Monday. And Monday could be an explosion or implosion. I don't have any positions, but I am thinking of buying shares and Fall calls. I just wanted to get some genuine discussion on a hot stock that is surely striking fomo in many of us",[],0

Just like the white winged dove  
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing  
Ooh, ooh, ooh  
Just like the white winged dove  
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing  
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

And the days go by, like a strand in the wind  
In the web that is my own, I begin again  
Said to my friend, baby (everything stopped)  
Nothin' else mattered

He was no more than a baby then  
Well he seemed broken-hearted  
Something within him  
But the moment that I first laid  
Eyes on him, all alone  
On the edge of seventeen

Just like the white winged dove  
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing  
I said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh  
Just like the white winged dove  
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing  
I said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

Well, I went today  
Maybe I will go again tomorrow  
Yeah yeah,‚Ä¶ [More](https://www.google.com/search?q=lyrics+edge+of+seventeen&sxsrf=ALeKk0067OoFS4_XW1EKWW6q9yiHgNP5MQ:1621478655397&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi23I_antfwAhWRhJ4KHSVNDosQ_AUIDigA&biw=922&bih=441&dpr=2.08#)",[],1
