You know what is common to going slow and low efficiency, the physics of unsprung mass.

Oh, as to brake assemblies... does not the endurance also need brakes?

Whatever. This race turned out as one would expect for a car built with too much unsprung mass.

Unsprung mass is the mass beneath the suspension. That is the part of the vehicle that is supposed to track the road. When you have bumps the unsprung mass acts directly on that. So the more unsprung mass the harder the bumps are hit and more work is needed (i.e. the wheels absorb more energy from the bump so you have to work harder to continue moving). The unsprung mass also reduces the damping ability of the tires as it does not have the suspension to help isolate the weight. So your tires will deform more on hitting a bump. Also, when hitting a bump, the more unsprung mass the more likely the wheel will actually bump up and leave the road temporarily as the suspension has to work harder to keep it down (since there is more force involved in hitting every bump).

Here are some sources that discuss unsprung mass to help you out:

then you look at the other facts:

1. tesla has almost gone unopposed for US EVs (unless you consider things like the leaf/mini-E/500 etc actual competition). Only true competition  was the e-tron.

2. tesla is still just getting the new EV and new Tesla buyers. if you could spend 40k+ on an EV, you had literally 1 option until this year.

3. gross margins are cute but unless they have the growth to cover operating costs, it would essentially mean nothing.

4. all the new players in the game. Mach E, R1t/R1s, lightning, e-trons, air, fisker?, ride?, hummer, EQS/EQC.

That’s not a maybe it will go to 500k it’s a fact if that scenario happens. 
That inflow of money will take Bitcoin to 500k giving it the same market cap of gold.

Serious advice only please.

The sharesave scheme I'm in is being closed soon and I have the option of cashing it in or paying in for a further 6 months then cashing in.  
  
I pay in to 3 separate 3 year schemes with varying amounts in them. These can each be cashed in soon or in 6 months separately, I can make an individual choice for each of them, they don't have to be all soon or all 6 months.  
  
The shares we buy are Walmart shares.  
  
On the one hand if I cash in now I'll get fewer shares but then if I cash in later I'll have more shares which would compensate for a small drop in the price if it does fall.

You make your small win betting side the side the ball falls to the most, and cover the next hot six with your medium bet. For American, you place between the zeros. Luck does factor in, but if you go to the casino, you go to lose money anyways. At the very least, you get to lengthen the loss. I walked in expecting to lose the $300 I walked in with.

What core inflation is looking at is if prices of goods and services are going up without the effects of energy prices which go up and down so regularly its not accurate to include them.

So basically what could cause core inflation to go up?

Well you said it in your analysis...wages. wages are the core source of inflation in an economic model. If wages go up then everything becomes more expensive. This is taking everything else equal of course. Wages CAN go up without causing inflation if it is paired with increased productivity. 

Think of it like this: how much does it cost to make something? Well you need raw resources, energy, and then manpower or technology. If manpower costs go up they aren't ever going down which means inflation. Of energy prices go up, well they can go back down in a month...its temporary. Raw materials are the same...during supply shocks like we ha e right now prices go up. But then produce trying to capitalize on higher prices increase supply and prices go back down. Simple market dynamics. 

So tldr: inflation is caused by higher real wages without increases productivity.",[],0

• The swap live could signal a ready position to start penetrating the Euorpean market and bringing on their current waitlist in Europe
• Their partnership with Market Rebellion and Blockdaemon could bring light a strategy in the short term for adding stocks, and enhanced interest rates both on cryptos and stocks. Then expanding into an education platform as well
• Their recent announcement of partnership with Lottery.com could be an opportunity for them to showcase to the market how they plan on partnering with future companies and banking institutions.
• Their debit cards, credit cards and margin are features expected to be announced soon. Creating an option for total banking inside of Voyager to earn 9% interest on USDC and holding crypto and fiat as a banking method which could increase monies held and stickiness.
• Times of volatility should increase Voyager’s profitability based on past exchange evaluations and given the fact of not just increased orders but more arbitrage opportunities for their routing system.
• They just announced various new talented board members and leaders
o New CDO – ex executive at Uber, Oracle JPMorgan and more
o New CMO- ex CMO of E-TRADE
o New Board Members- CFO of Raymond James, CEO of Gain Retail at StoneX
• Voyager was approved by the NCIB to repurchase up to 5% of its stock between May 30th 2021 and May 30th 2022.
• The liquidity of Voyager stock right now is very low with a trade volume close to only 1.2%
• The short ratio to volume is about 70%
 
So, what would ignite the flame and cause a momentum and followed by short squeezes?
Voyager’s CEO next week has earnings on the 25th and is joining a large blockchain conference Consensus to talk about Voyager.

During these meetings he could begin laying out some powerful customer metrics, expanding on some of these past announcements and take advantage of the Consensus to speak about technical improvements.
 
Some of these could alone drive a market momentum and short squeeze and at the start of the next business week he could drive the short squeeze even harder by doing stock buy backs.
 
Low liquidity and low-priced stocks are prime for this due to some of the tools to reduce market volume even further like we saw with GameStop.
 
My cautionary aspect is that he is unable to expand on some of these announcements and during the conference and earnings people are looking at Voyager unfavorably as they experience several outages along with other crypto exchanges. This cautionary aspect would hinder short term speculaters but I do not see it as a concern yet for long term holders given the high retention, and overall favorable reviews about the platform online.",[],1

Dude, really, you're hearing about Tesla more than their competitors because Teslas are most popular among redditors and zoomers who like to share their lives online. The boomers who can actually afford fancy new AI powered cars don't waste time posting about it online. Tesla have two things going for them, marketing, and range. Turns out 200km is enough for most consumers, beyond that there's diminishing utility. Competitors could boost the range, but the cost outweighs the demand from most consumers.

As for marketing, that only takes you so far. Maybe when the zoomers pay off their college debt, Tesla will take over the auto market, but I don't see that happening myself.","['TSLA', 'AI']",0

&nbsp;

And no, the mods aren't going to just bend the rules (or outright get rid of them, rather) like you're asking for them to do. People can talk about whatever stock they want (assuming it's not a SPAC or a penny stock for obvious reasons) but that doesn't mean that every single kind of post is equal and valid.

Easy example, if I were to pretend to be a woman and start posting porn on here, and it were to be upvoted to the front page by a bunch of horny Redditors (not exactly unrealistic) should it be allowed to stay? What about if I made it vaguely market themed porn? Obviously that would be a case of people ""telling the mods what they like"" but that isn't because they think it's good content for WSB, it would be because they like tits in general.

People can talk about what they want but that doesn't mean everything belongs on every subreddit. A lot of people have been coming here for years because they enjoy WSB and the community that has been fostered here. That includes the general opposition to content that would be considered low effort and/or uninteresting. I get that a lot of new people showed up recently and don't fully understand the sub yet (although plenty of people have integrated successfully as well) but that doesn't mean that this community should alienate the people who have been here for years to cater to the new majority.

If you want a community with different visions then that is perfectly fine, I'm certainly not going to insult you over that, but I would ask that you not change *WSB* away from what has made WSB great all this time. It's perfectly fine to visit multiple subreddits, after all.",['GME'],1

I'm tagging you to add some bear points, and then counter those points with the bull thesis:

Bears say:

1) GOS is suffering huge compression due to companies trying to net volume and the RKT-UWMC price war. UWMC is guiding for Gain on Sale of between .75%-1.15% which is a very significant decrease from Q4 2020 or even Q1 2021.

2) Refinance is slowing down due to higher interest rates.

Bulls Counter:

1) GOS nosediving after booming is natural as it's cyclical. People want to retain as much volume as possible. However, it then goes back to its historical medium of between 1.15%-1.85%.

2) Even at 75BPS, the company is profitable.

3) MSR's value should rise as interest rates rise, and can go high enough to cover expenses for the company as well as the dividend. 

4) They are lowering margin to acquire market share instead of doing acquisitions because it's cheaper for them and more efficient. Other companies don't have the systems they do, and UWMC's systems are the best in class.

5) Interest Rates are still the lowest they've ever been and below 2019. It's only ever been lower last year. 

6) They are purchase oriented, and have been except for 2020. 2018 and 2019 were more purchase heavy than refinance heavy. They also do better in a higher interest rate environment, because they can offer mortgage rates at roughly 15 BPS lower, and as they margin expand through technology it will increase. Home purchases are also complicated while refinance isn't, so time to close is heavily important. They are more than 2.3x faster than anyone else.",[],0

You have a call option at 50 cents or above to be in money. Let's say 1 year away.  

Let's say to scenarios could play out.

1. What if price is at .40 goes to .55 and reverse split to 1.10. You own the strike price of .50 call option. Do you still buy 100 shares at 50 cents and then can double your money?

2. Let's say it goes to 30 cents and they have to do a 4 to 1 consolidation for the target compliance. They go to 1.20. does  this mean while the .50 call option is held? I still hold that strike? I understand after reverse split it could go down or up in value.

Can someone please help me understand so I can be a good investor.  If this shit is like magic the gathering it should hold 100 shares at the 50 strike price for a 50 percent gain I think.

The issues I mentioned involved its impact on efficiency and the greater forces involved on hitting bumps, which this article does not address (to be honest, it does gloss over when road surfaces get rougher, but does not alleviate the concerns there).

Maintenance of an EV with the motor suspended is very simple as you have your half-shaft connecting your wheel to the motor. The motor is better protected so it will have less maintenance issues. The wheels get less abuse, so less maintenance issues. And frankly half-shafts should last the life of the vehicle without any major maintenance.

Regarding efficiency of transferring form a motor mounted via half-shafts versus in-wheel motors. Inherently a mounted motor allows you to use reduction gears and have greater flexibility resulting in a more efficient motor to begin with. Further, the losses of turning a half-shaft are probably very minimal and far less than unsprung weight causes. If LMC ever manages to release a vehicle for someone to test, I guess we can look at the weight, the kWh's, and range in real-life to get a better idea of what the real efficiency losses are.",[],1

They also want those who are allocated shares to hold them for some period of time, not flip them the day it begins trading.

AMC is the largest theater chain and is currently undervalued compared to its competitors (Regal and Cinemark). I think a squeeze is unlikely but it will climb. How long that climb is sustainable is yet to be seen. I don't have faith in AMC leadership (like you said, not a great stock from the start) and the pandemic has really expedited alternative distribution methods that I don't see going away. If AMC positions itself to be more than just a theater but a large-screen venue they could see a boost.

Things are open but theaters rely on the exclusive distribution of movies to get people in to buy their stuff. The model isn't great long-term and while a lot of people are eager to get back into theaters, there will be a trickle of movies and I believe streaming will really eat into their share.

There may be some movies that may draw me to a theater just for the experience, but I'd much rather stay home, save my money, and watch it the same day it gets released in theaters and streaming services.

The management team has figured out, where most have not, the opportunity that is Lago Vista. They are now building modular condos in Lago Vista, they surprised with an earnings beat and higher guidance and the stock is up 8% today.. I just bought 1,000 shares even up 8% today (12% short interest):  
  
https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210511005742/en/SGB-Development-Corp.-Acquires-Lago-Vista-Site-on-Lake-Travis  
  
The National Media has been slow to see the story out there and SGBX is taking advantage of it:  
  
https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/stockdetails/fi-a22tvh  
  
SGB Development Corp should understand that to get water and utilities to the new Tessara Development, they ran those right by where this lot is for sale. Several months ago the old 58 acre private golf course that closed in 2000 sold. The City is historically Republican, the HOA is easy on building and there isn't a lot of Cynthia's out there. But the conservative city makes the developers put the utilities in whereas some cities to stimulate growth will do that. So developers in Lago Vista are building where utilities are near. The cheapest lot without utilities is worth about $30,000, the cheapest lot with utilities is about $75,000. A developer that bought this lot would not have far to run utilities to get to these lots and would have a whole hell of a lot of equity in the lot just getting the utilities put in. 5GB Development should buy this lot, it's also on one of the flattest part of Lago Vista (makes clearing and pouring the cement easy):

You cannot find a gas car capable of these specs. This is because voltage and current from a battery can be manipulated and induced to maximize power with very few limitations, whereas a gas is limited by the mechanical limitations of the engine. The Ford EV F150 can go 0-60 mph in 4 seconds which is 1 second faster than ford’s fastest truck. The Ford EV F150 is claimed to be Ford’s most powerful truck with 560 HP. The only draw back is the charging location. Once fast DC charging is widely available, gas cars will be on the decline.

Take a look underneath a current trophy truck. What do you see in the rear? Solid axle. 

Again, what do you think those cast iron solid axles weigh? 

Unsprung mass only matters in relation to sprung mass. This is why CV shafts were adopted in small vehicles first. The greater the weight of the vehicle, the less of an impact it has. Would you call an EV truck with batteries light or heavy?

3/4 ton and up trucks are still running solid axles front and rear.

Having said that, this company recently filed an S-3 Shelf Registration Statement with the SEC to sell $350M of stock at the market price, whenever they choose.  So your position is about to, if not already, get seriously diluted.  When they filed, it was trading at $9.  Now it's $5.xx.  So assuming an average of $7, that's 50 million new shares being issued.

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411690/000114036121009770/nt10022040x1\_424b5.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411690/000114036121009770/nt10022040x1_424b5.htm)

This is in addition to the 29M shares they issued in January. 

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411690/000114036121000735/nt10018741x4\_424b5.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411690/000114036121000735/nt10018741x4_424b5.htm)

So this company has shown a proclivity to issue new shares as they need to refill their coffers at the expense of the shareholders.  I'm not sure I would like being constantly diluted every time they need money.

Right now they have a market cap of $1.5B on $10M of TTM revenue, -$40M of TTM net income, and -$153M of accumulated deficit.

“Bulls want to see Tilray’s stock break up bullish from the symmetrical triangle and regain support of the 21-day EMA. If Tilray makes a bullish move, it has room to move up towards the $17.50 level. If its stock was able to break above that level with momentum, it could reach $20.80 before bumping into more resistance.

Bears want to see Tilray’s stock break down bearish from the triangle and lose support of the eight-day EMA. If the stock does break bearish from the triangle, it could fall down to meet support at the 200-day SMA but if that level didn’t hold, it could fall further toward $11.87.”",[],0

I think it's already priced in for Ford, the only way that will cause a surge on their end will be if fleet sales go in an unexpected direction. Which I don't think they will. Because that's what unexpected means.   


However, I do see that hype as deflating RIDE a little bit.   


I got out yesterday with like a hundred bucks' profit. I got in late April for around $9/share for like $300 invested.   
Rule of three. If something's been going well for you three days in a row, consider taking profit.   


I'm not even pretending there was anything more to it than a superstitious impulse. No math, no logic, no patterns. I just felt like it was about to go the other way because it had gone the green direction for too long.

Within a month or two, buying hard disks will be pointless as the only way to keep a ROI on it will be SSDs (already is), and these in turn will also quickly become obsolete in terms of ROI due to the insane amount of storage added to it, making returns plateauing.

That's when you will get a tsunami wave of individuals dumping their hard drive farms in the second hand market, relieving retail demand for storage space and killing prices.

In other words, the new currency has a spike in storage demand now, but given its trajectory vs. the ROI that is achieved it's very likely to lead to quick dumps of the bought storage space to the second hand market as it's already considered 'late' to enter by individuals. Once people realize that for every day that passes they need additional terabytes of space just to stay in the same ROI, they will get off it quickly.",[],0

7631,gyuzm6h,2021-05-20,t1_gyuv4k3,wallstreetbets,"Fair points.

Trophy Trucks in the front and the Endurance Truck in the front had similar setups, just the Endurance had that extra weight on its front wheels.

Regarding the rear, you might be right that a solid axle weighs a bit, but the axle acts as a component of the suspension in connecting the suspension to the wheels. You would need two independent suspensions for the Endurance which when you factor everything in (including the dual motors), well I can't say for certain, but am guessing the Endurance has some extra weight there (but maybe not much difference).

Also, thinking about a solid-axle with a single suspension versus in-wheel motors with independent suspensions (and no axle), I would think the solid-axle design, even it it weighs the same, would better allow the forces to be distributed over the full suspension whereas an independent design could result in more forces acting on one side or the other (i.e. unsprung weight is a bigger issue without a solid-axle perhaps).

Perhaps a rear-drive setup would have been better for LMC, but they might not get enough power out of just two motors, hence they need all-wheel drive.

I think you make good points and I am speculating a bit here. Bottom line, it seems to me, that the Endurance performed as expected if unsprung mass is an issue. Without someone having access to measure every aspect of it and compare there is really no way to know for sure whether what I am saying is correct, but to me it makes sense.",[],1

Then in 2020 and they had 255.3M in revenue, or a -24% growth rate. Yet the stock is WAY WAY WAY higher than before pandemic and before Pandemic their growth rate was practically 0%. Now it is negative. Even if Build a Bear would regain its entire 2019 revenue the fair value of the stock is before $5. Don't listen to the news outlets pumping reopening socks so they can dump these massive bags on you. The market has Build a Bear style stocks everywhere right now. Look at SEAS it is the same story and its fair value is under $20 based on pre-pandemic revenue. These reopening stocks are priced to grow at 50-200% rates like tech companies and their historical growth rates are non-existent. There is no reason to believe they will achieve massive growth after the pandemic.",[],0

If you are long congrats. However if you are gonna tell me about their amazing tech & innovation fuck off!  UPST is just another overvalued, Ai, SaaS, Payment High-flyer who forgot it’s 2021 but IPO’ed late last year under the shadow of ABNB & DASH however just like the ladder two GOLDMAN is also their Godfather (took all 3 public) and GS takes care of it’s babies.  Compared to it’s more celebrated peers UPST was of to a slow start. IPO’ed at $20 (the low end of the range $20 - $24), hardly drew any buzz and post IPO sat around for a few days kinda lost. 

GOLDMAN TO THE RESCUE: Once Goldman shoved a stupidly high valuation which the market accepted for ABNB & DASH then it focused it’s attention on poor little UPST and started to drive interest for the shares (part of the GS starter kit when you select them to run your IPO which founders & round investors love.  They need to make sure to pump the price hard before lock-up expiration *THIS IS KEY.

RECAP: UPST, went public at $20 in Dec the week after the other two and once public had a $1.8 Billion valuation and already trading at a rich valuation (just earlier in 2020 it has been valued around $800MM).  

TODAY’s VALUATIONS: Fast forward; today UPST is valued over $10 Billion trading at a whopping $135 per share Est PE: 200X PS: 40X PB: 30X (regardless of future potential growth these are disgustingly high valuations) oh JUST OVER 40% OF THE SHARES ARE STILL LOCKED!  

TRADE / LOCKUP EXPIRATION / JULY: Lock you for UPST is scheduled for early July which will increase the float by 40% and this event will trigger pressure on the shares (round investors selling, in creasing the supply) and mixed with a higher interest rate environment and stupid high valuations WILL CUT THE CURRENT PRICE BY AT LEAST 50%.

Coinbase is one of the top 5 most profitable exchanges in the world. Coinbase might make more money than Nasdaq. Coinbase is going to be huge because this is the first time we are able to directly play crypto in the equity market. Why I like COIN is that it is a play on Bitcoin AND all the other coins out there...whereas bitcoin is just a play on bitcoin, so you are getting all the other coins for free. COIN is heavily (96%) tied to the price of bitcoin, which is very hard to predict. Another advantage of COIN being the first crypto exchange coming onto the market first is that they potentially can use their stock as currency to buy any other competitors. And you don't have to believe in the crypto party line and the dangers of fiat currency and how you need an alternative, because central banks all over the world are printing money like crazy - even if you think this is nonsense, we know that there is a market for this kind of nonsense because gold bugs have been saying the same thing for decades. In other words, crypto has a natural constituency. Like gold, people buy it as a kind of inflation insurance and gold's strength is its scarcity - its supply only increases about 1% per year and it is getting harder and harder to find more - that sounds a lot like Bitcoin to me and I think it is totally legitimate to believe that crypto, in general, can rival gold as a storehold of value.",[],0
