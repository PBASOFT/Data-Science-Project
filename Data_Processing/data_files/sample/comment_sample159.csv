44,gzaqutk,2021-05-24,t1_gynl4tk,investing,"Not outrageous at all considering the stability and predictability of their business, debt duration and interest rates, and inflation (good for debt). Disney has $50B debt and $60B revenue with way lower margins and trades at 2x the  prevailing ev/sales multiple of PF newco. 

Debt can be bad, but in the case of this merger it's good leverage. WarnerDiscovery is content from the best tv and movie studio in WB/HBO + all the other brands they own, funded by the highest margin content producer in the industry which is international and diversified. They generate so much cash flow (discounting cost and distribution synergies) that the debt will be at a normal ratio 2 years from now. 

The combined company is a more durable and attractive asset than Netflix or Disney content-wise. Disney has a low growth, infrastructure intensive half of their business and less diversified (though hugely popular) content. Netflix is going to be scraping margins to ATTEMPT to produce high quality media forever. That said, Disney is a known quantity and Netflix has negligible debt and most subs. But from a valuation perspective and  'outperformance of growth expectations' perspective (how money is made in equities) WarnerDiscovery is an obvious buy comparatively. 

Buying Disney or Netflix is assuming very high growth. Buying WarnerDiscovery (via $DISCA/K) is assuming the company will at least sustain operating cash flow, and after this down week, it's just an assumption there won't be a decline. It looks like Apple in 2013 to me. I made a similar decision then. The market was literally pricing a decline and I said ""I don't think so"" and bought. The risk of the debt is overstated. They could sell off CNN for $10B cash, but the $0.5-1B profit from that alone is prob worth keeping at 3%.",['AAPL'],0

Hello everyone. I have had close to a 1000 of units of ERRFY since some time in 2020. These units were located in two separate brokerages - Wells Fargo and Fidelity). 

I  noticed that my own Google Spreadsheet stopped returning quotes for ERRFY, but I just assumed it was a temporarily glitch, of which Google Finance API had plenty. However, it seems that the ADR is now non-existent. I found no news to the matter by searching online.

Last Friday, I called Wells Fargo, and a trader listened to me and said ""I don't see any issues with this ticket"". I then asked him to put one unit for sale, which he was able to do. However, a couple of minutes later, that order was cancelled. I later received a voicemail from the trader, saying that ""the ticket seems no longer listed in the US"". 

Has anyone every run into this situation before? What are my options?

The U.S. Treasury market is stable not because nobody fears inflation, it's because there is more demand for Treasuries in it than supply.

EU Bonds pay far less than Treasuries and China is clamping down on debt while the underlying risks of dealing with the Chinese government are actually increasing. That leaves really only one market for pensions and other fixed income players to go: Treasuries. 

However, the supply of new notes is capped and might be decreasing relative to the growth of demand. The Fed also holds something like 20% of the value of the market and is not letting go.

It is reasonable to expect that competition will drive those fees down over time (how long is an open question), just as in the world of discount stock brokerages.",[],0

You could just invest in dia qqq and spy and be hitting similar percentages as your swing trade profits *(with less capital gains taxes)

Just some of the models I've seen have so many different numbers. Profit margins and the growth of these, tax rates, plus other factors. But it all boils down to free cash flow in the end. That's my assumption that I'm struggling to get past anyway.

In fact there are some theories about dividend scalping, ie
Xyz company has ex-div date of june 1.....buy the shares a few days ahead of that date.....maybe may 23 or so. Then on june 1 collect dividend. Then on jun 2 set a limit order to sell the shares at 2 cents above the price you paid for the shares on may 23. Set and forget. A few weeks later the share price balances out to where you bought it and your shares sell for 2 cent profit......then rinse and repeat with a different company.

This would obviously result in some capital gains taxes but if you made $1000 in dividends and owed $200 in taxes you would still be up $800 profit on the year.

I love the idea as it is a flawless easy money concept.

 Only issue is if you pick the right ETF maybe you make more capital gains on the value of your stocks than the measly 0.19 cents per share - i think thats why you must find the highest dividend payers to even make this plan worth your time.

325,gzbhmk4,2021-05-24,t1_gzas5un,investing,"Nameplate capacity, for example, is in MWs. Even for batteries.  

MWh is not capacity, it's a measure of energy. MW is a measure of power.  

**Energy** = power sustained over a unit of time.  

**MW** = the capacity to create energy by generating that MW measurement of power for a period of time.

Just MWh on its own is more useless than MW because we do not know the discharge window.

Batteries are measured in MW/MWh. Typically in the solar industry batteries and utility scale sites are normally sized 1:1 and are intended to take advantage of peak rates, so they are designed to absorb all of the capacity of a solar farm and then discharge in a short period of time.  

So if I have a 2MW solar facility with a 2MW battery and I am targeting peak rates with a 1 hour (which is the typical length of contracted peak rates in my experience) discharge window then the capacity (2MW) is the same as the energy output (2MWh).  Otherwise if it is 4 hours, then the system would be rate at 2MW / 8MWh but the nameplate would still be referred to as 2MW.",[],0

Ben Bernanke was the Chair of the Federal Reserve from 2006 to 2014. His academic focus on the deflationary period of the Great Depression deeply informed his policy:

His successor, Yellen, did not raise rates *at the expense of* unemployment.

>So for most of that time period, the Fed has tended to focus primarily on the ""low inflation"" part of its mandate at the expense of the ""low unemployment"" part.  


The unemployment measure used by the Fed already reached 5% or lower by this time and stayed there, moving even lower, until covid. So, no, the Fed did not endanger the ""low unemployment"" part of their mandate when they raised interest rates.

That said, Coinbase does have (some) reputable competition. And it does seem like there is probably enough space in the market for crypto exchanges to accommodate at least one other major player. That also highlights another advantage Coinbase has at this nascent stage. As I understand it, Coinbase (and its primary US competitors) isn’t a brokerage, it’s an exchange on which its customers can directly buy and sell supported crypto assets. Alongside this, they offer services as some kind of quasi-custodian for customer assets held with (or by) the exchange (from which account such assets can then be sold or transferred by the customer). I say quasi-custodian because I don’t understand these to be fully segregated “customer accounts”, as one would have with a fully compliant stock brokerage. So at least right now, anyone who wants to truly act as a brokerage would need to pay fees as applicable to Coinbase or some other market maker, and then charge its own customers some amount sufficient to cover costs and generate a return. 

All that to say, while I would hardly expect a race to zero trading costs in crypto, and while I do think Coinbase is in a good position to continue charging substantial trading fees, I do think there Coinbase will see sufficient competition — even without the big brokerages entering its space — to force some degree of price competition over time.",[],0

This article is a click-bait article that makes the rounds every few months. You can find hundreds of articles pointing to CLOs as a “problem.”

Without going into detail here are some major points that I bring up:

1) A AAA-rated CLO tranche has *never* defaulted. Even during the GFC, AAA bonds still paid.

2) Capital markets are stronger than ever. There is so much dry powder and liquidity right now that a company has many alternatives to refinance their loans if necessary.

3) Loans have performed exceptionally well during covid. Low default rates. 

4) There is very high demand for CLOs as we enter into a period of rising because the bonds are floating. 

5) CLOs have many “tests” that managers must pass. This involves replacing assets that are causing the CLO to fail. 

6) Seniority in the capital stack decreases the loss intensity for defaulting loans in the CLO.",[],0

574,gzcho2n,2021-05-25,t1_gzabmu6,investing,"Another explanation that I never see discussed, is that total wealth has increased, here's a write up I did a couple of months back, the \[\] are my additions:

It's hard to put it into numbers, but here are two reports from 2010 and 2020: [2010 Credit Suisse](https://www.macrotrends.net/2016/10-year-treasury-bond-rate-yield-chart) [2020 Credit Suisse](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiZmOeEofzvAhWEMVkFHUEBCUEQFjABegQIBRAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.credit-suisse.com%2Fmedia%2Fassets%2Fcorporate%2Fdocs%2Fabout-us%2Fresearch%2Fpublications%2Fglobal-wealth-report-2020-en.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2uB7smxwX7h1Rgez9bLspG)

To summarize:

In 2000, global wealth was roughly $110 Trillion.

In 2010, global wealth was roughly $200 Trillion.

In 2020, global wealth was roughly $400 Trillion.

When one understands just how much wealth is chasing fewer relative returns, it makes sense why interest rates have fallen and are unlikely to return to former levels.

[10 year US treasury for past 50 years](https://www.macrotrends.net/2016/10-year-treasury-bond-rate-yield-chart)

Notice that from 2000 to 2020, US interest rates dropped from 5% to about 2%, and world wealth quadrupled. Why didn't US interest rates drop to 1.25% \[5% / 4\]? Because there were other opportunities for that money elsewhere in the world \[growth in china, and elsewhere\].

Even during the pandemic, we only lost about $7 trillion in wealth globally, so we spent about 1.75% of our wealth shutting down and fighting a disease for a year globally.

So I would wager that longish term interest rates \[inflation\] are set to stay low for my and your foreseeable lifetimes, and that stock market returns are going to meet a similar fate. Just simple math of more wealth chasing relatively fewer returns.  


\[Additionally, there is the population discussion, that global population growth has slowed, and as such the strain on food production is decreasing. (and energy production costs are dropping, in inflation adjusted terms)",[],0

Underlying assets of CDOs differed significantly from those of CLOs. Yes, there are corporate debt CDOs. However, the CDOs that really took the spotlight in 08 were those consisting of tens of thousands of individual mortgages, aka MBS. 

That being said, the financial reporting requirements of individuals is significantly lax than that of the borrowers of CLOs, which will have financial statements that are audited by third parties. This is mandatory because loan credit agreements will include that in the language. Point here is that the information is much more reliable for the assets held in CLOs.

FAQ

**What does this mean?**

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

**Why did you do this?**

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

Rudeness towards other Redditors,

Spreading incorrect information,

Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

**Am I banned from the Reddit?**

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

**I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?**

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

**How can I prevent this from happening in the future?**

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",[],0

You spent $1,000 and bought 30 coins. That's $33.3 per coin.

Next month, it goes up, you spend another $1,000 and bought 20 coins. That's $50 per coin.

You now have 50 coins.

You sell 50% of your coins, so 25 coins. Using FIFO, those 25 coins are the oldest you bought, back then it cost you $33.3 per coin, so your cost basis is 25 x $33.3 = $832.5. The difference is our gain.

669,gzcsf0d,2021-05-25,t1_gzabmu6,investing,"Well... first of all, \*real\* inflation - the way they measured it prior to the 1990s - hasn't been 2.34% over the last 30 years.  It's been meaningfully higher.  It's just that the BLS changed the way inflation was calculated so that it would save the Treasury money on COLA adjustments and keep interest rates low.  So, let's be clear, inflation has probably been running at 4%-5% per year based on the old methodology.  So, if it ""feels"" like prices have been running at a higher rate of inflation than the BLS reports... well, you're right.  This notion of ""transitory inflation"" is a fvcking joke.  Once prices are up 10% or whatever the number is... they ain't going back down.  That's a permanent increase.  Honestly, since Paul Volcker left the Fed it's been run by a bunch of fvcking insecure children desperately seeking approval from their political masters.  The only thing these a55hats know how to do is inflate asset bubbles.  But, yeah, of course... the inflation will be ""transitory"" so it's no big deal.  We'll just leave rates near zero forever so that the real return on bonds will be negative forever.  No big deal... nothing to see here.",[],0

679,gzctejw,2021-05-25,t3_nk0n2u,investing,"The biggest advantage to a more granular DCF is your ability to test out different scenarios. DCF modelling is as much of an art as it is a discipline. If your model has more granularity, you can test out different scenarios such as, what happens if CapEx increases but Revenue stays the same. Or what if SBC goes down and D&A goes up. By being able to map out all these different scenarios you'll have a pretty good idea of what the fair value of the company is based on new information that is released to the public. With the information you have on a company today, the company might be valued fairly at $25/PS but tomorrow the company might announce they will be increasing spending to their CapEx in-order to stay competitive, then the day after that inflation shoots up 10% from a day before and your discount rate has to be adjusted to reflect the new inflation rate. All these factors change the value of a company significantly. But if you've only used 1 or 2 line items to project your DCF to come up with an intrinsic value you wouldn't be able to make all these adjustments to your DCF to test out different scenarios. I don't think intrinsic value is a single price target, it needs to be adjusted into many different price targets based on micro and macro events. So to conclude, you as the modeller/analyst have to decide which line item is important to you or the company that you're modelling and which line item is irrelevant, and from there you can decide how complex or simple you want to make your DCF.",[],0

Even my no frills, 50 cent minimum savings account pays a WHOPPING .15%. Fast forward to April and now the Fed Funds rate is only .07%. Worthless.

Of course the Fed will still buy this to maintain solvency.

And this with Tesla having roughly twice the market cap of Toyota right now. So I would say little to none?

Let's assume that Tesla becomes the largest auto manufacturer in the world, and expands its other business lines too... everything it is looking at (and is currently a major player in none, even automanufacturing) is high capital cost and low margins. Rideshare, renewable energy, batteries... there is a lot of competition in all of these areas, the margins are super low, and tesla is dominant (in most cases non-existent) in none of them right now.

I wouldnt short Tesla, because it is a sentiment stock and those can be very unpredictable, but I certainly wouldnt be counting on it to beat the market over the next decade. Amazon has a much better chance of that, and is a much larger company (normally a minus when talking about growth)... but involved in much higher margin, and much faster growing, sectors (the auto industry hasn't been a fast growing sector for many years).

If you can't move your crypto to an offline wallet or a wallet where you can stake & earn interest or even just to another exchange, then the implication is that you don't actually own it. Exchanges like coinbase/binance/kraken etc. have minimal risk attached to them but when you start working your way down the list outside the top 10/20 exchanges then the risk of them being hacked, someone gaining access to your account if your security isn't good enough or even the exchange exit scamming goes up. It was a big thing in the real early years of crypto & several high profile cases (Mt. Gox especially) meant a lot of emphasis was placed on moving your crypto into a personal wallet. 

Personally I have no issue with leaving crypto on coinbase other than the fact you can't stake it there. I'd also have no issue with Binance, Kraken & a few others. Binance especially offers some insane APY rates for staking. There's maybe a handful of other exchanges I'd keep my crypto on outside of that but I've no need to use them because you can get any coin you want on the top ones.

property is great to buy because you can rent it out and make passive income. no matter what market we're in people need a place to live and you can cash in on that. yearly yields of 2 - 8 percent are pretty standard in property.   


another cool thing to maybe consider, when you purchase a property you're purchasing a set amount of currency. e.g. if i buy an apartment in the UK for 10,000 pounds it's similar to investing 10,000 pounds into the UK. Depending on what your purpose is for the property it's something worth considering.

I would watch which ones you are interested in, not all manufactuers are the same.

AMD - Personal Computers mostly, both GPU and CPU.

INTL - Business oriented, most revenue comes from server chips but still huge in the Personal Computer market, also some speculation of INTL breaking into the GPU market.

IBM - Servers, proprietary systems and single-task machines? I think their mission statement has shifted a bit since the 90s and i'm not informed as well on their dealings. I always think super computers tucked away 500ft underground or maybe that electronic cash register at walmart? not sure...

TSM - Only one out of the pack that doesn't design it's own chips. Manufactures chips on the behalf of other companies, sensitive to foriegn relations and tariffs as... It's in Taiwan.

NVDA - Bull or Bust IMO, they used to or maybe still do make board controllers and south bridges, but the real money is in their GPUs. There is an excess demand for their GPUs and they simply cannot fill them all. If Crypto Mining falls out of fashion brace for sharp decline, 2nd hand market will be flooded with GPUs, scalpers will disappear and miners will likely stop buying them. Supposedly NVDA won't be affected by this because the demand has always beat supply in this market. NVDA sells to retailers at MSRP, not actual customers and retailers have always been keen to buy as much stock of GPUs as they can in the past, but if crypto mining falls out? Who knows.

AAPL - Apple makes alot of it's own chips for it's own devices, so it's kind of a closed loop but again, it does still make chips like the M2.

I started to get into investment's when I was 25 but fully worked out my plan after tweaking and playing around with different fields. We have Superannuation which is your 401K equivalent, the issue is that out Government can raise the access age which currently it is 60 by could be 65 in the near future. We get paid approx 9.5% to our retirement account. 

Option A) I have worked out that the lump sum I deposited early this year provided if was never to touch it ever again or make any deposits for another 32 years with a compound rate of 9% I would have close to $2.5 to 3 Million Dollars... On my 70th birthday it would equate to $6 Million Dollars. 

Option B) But If I was to rely on my employer to pay my Retirement 9.5% of my wage for the next 32 years I would only receive $1.25 to $1.5 Million, provided If I can keep my job for 32 years and not get fired... 

I do have some money aside for dips and a house deposit... Here in Australia housing is extremely fucked up. If I was to use my current investments for a house deposit (note I am single) I would still need to owe $300K to the bank and the opportunity cost is Millions provided I don't lose my job in the next 32 years and can stay afloat on every payment...

This follows a day of gains on Monday as the Nasdaq gained 1.4% and S&P 1%. Cryptos even stabilized.

New home sales for May are due at 1000, with the consensus estimate calling for 970k, a drop from last month’s 1,021k which was the highest we’ve seen in years. If the actual number beats that you should see inflation concerns return to the fore.

For example my dad gets access to his not so small pension pot next year. But inflation just in the last year has decreased its value by 10%. Imagine if you were relying on your 10k investment portfolio to carry you through from 70 years old to 100. Let's assume for ignorance sake that you haven't been able to amass any wealth or assets in the previous 70 years. You rent, you dont have a massive savings pot or any children to fund your retirement.  Sure that 10k if it sustained 4% growth each year would be worth $150k. Divided by the 30 years of living left to do, thats $5k a year. Not really enough to live off. But to make it worse as you reach 70, the markets crash, loose 25% of its value over 3 months. Sure the law of averages would say that if you wait another 70 years then you would make that money back. But you don't have another 70 years. You have to retire, and you have to rely on those investments.  Suddenly you only have $120k to live off for 30 years. 

The problem we have today is that cash is no longer a stable investment.  Because the federal reserve is addicted to the money printer. So you are forced to take on risk in order to not lose money, which means inevitably some people will be forced into poverty at old age. 

The solution, as far as I can tell, is to turn off the money printers. If I put $1 in the bank today, I need to be confident that it will be worth the same when I take it out again. Or at least, mostly the same. I don't have that confidence, which means I either refuse to save money, choosing to spend it faster than I make it in a hyper consumerist economy. Or I choose to invest in in high risk stocks just so that I outstrip inflation, but I could lose it just as fast.",[],0

955,gzdnk33,2021-05-25,t3_nklpz0,investing,"Difficult question to answer. Mathematically, the correct time to buy is always now. At the same time, if you go all in, and then there is a major downturn, you are at risk of panic selling or at least severe distress/regret. There is no perfect answer here. 

You say you want to save up to buy a house and you expect this to take 9-11 years? That is long time! And the problem is that if the trend in housing continues your required deposit will get higher and higher - you'll never get there. Regardless, you certainly don't want to sit there with a cash pile for that long

I would suggest putting some (perhaps 50%) of your capital in now, and then putting more money in every month. This way a downturn doesn't destroy you (in fact it presents a buying opportunity), and at the same time, you get a reasonable overall rate of return, probably enough to cover inflation

However, as I say, if max returns are your aim, the correct answer is always all-in now. Just be sure you could actually handle a severe downturn, because many people say they can, then when it happens they cannot, and they pull out of fear - which is a terrible mistake",[],0
