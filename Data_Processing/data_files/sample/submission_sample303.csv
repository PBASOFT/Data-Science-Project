12,2021-05-20,pennystocks,"I'm surprised this subreddit isn't BUZZING about the potential $QNTA has in the coming months! Here's my summary of why $QNTA has HUGE potential.

-----------

Medolife Rx, Inc. (""Medolife"") is a global integrated biopharmaceutical company with R&D, manufacturing, and consumer product distribution, which is a majority owned subsidiary of Quanta, Inc. (OTC PINK: QNTA). They are in the process of getting their diluted scorpion venom drug, Escozine, approved by the FDA as an Investigational New Drug (IND). Escozine is claimed to have positive impacts on cancer treatments and also reduce the symptoms of COVID-19.


They have been submitting pre-clinical trial data for IND approval to the FDA since at least March. Approval from the FDA would allow them to conduct clinical trials in the US for Escozine.


https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medolife-rx-submits-final-data-123000200.html


https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/QNTA/news/story?e&id=1842198


------------


Where Escozine has made the most progress is in the Dominican Republic.


They are opening a scorpion venom extraction facility there to get raw material for their drug. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medolife-rx-announces-extraction-facility-120000538.html


They are planning to conduct double-blind Phase II clinical trials there on human patients. 
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medolife-rx-completes-initial-meeting-120000454.html


The drug is approved for sale in Latin American countries. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medolife-rx-announces-historic-product-120000114.html


""The Company has compiled large amounts of clinical data validating Escozine’s ability to not only improve quality of life in cancer patients, but also its potential ability to kill cancer cells, as shown in numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies on various forms of cancer that led to this historic registration. Medical professionals in the DR have embraced the use of Escozine® in cancer treatment regimens for some time now, including one providing a full recommendation on the drug’s cancer-fighting and quality-of-life improving attributes.""


The main goal/gamble with this stock is, diluted scorpion venom treatments have been seen as purely anecdotal by the medical community. What would be really huge here is if they are able to clinically prove Escozine has positive impacts on treating cancer and COVID-19, among other ailments. 

https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/scorpion-venom

""The claims made for blue scorpion venom marketed to cancer patients as Escozine, Escozul, and Vidatox (a homeopathic version) are mostly based on anecdotes, testimonials, and experiments which may or may not have been properly carried out. In Cuba where these products originated, the government rejected the use of Escozul in 2009 because there was not enough data. The homeopathic version, which uses very dilute solutions of the active ingredient, has not been shown to treat or prevent cancer. The properties of blue scorpion venom are just starting to be described more thoroughly in scientific research. Therefore, like venoms from other scorpion species, blue scorpion venom compounds one day may be isolated and properly developed to create cancer therapies, but much more research is needed.""

-----------

tl;dr: $QNTA is trying to clinically and scientifically prove the efficacy of scorpion venom treatments with their drug, Escozine. They are making great progress towards this in the Dominican Republic and the US, and the price action of the stock reflects this short and long term. Something to think about!",nh0dag,[],1

15,2021-05-24,pennystocks,"So a little bit about Doubleview Gold:

Doubleview Gold Corp. is a Canadian resource exploration and development company located in Vancouver British Columbia. Doubleview is publicly traded on the TSX-Venture Exchange [TSX-V: DBG], [OTC: DBLVF],  [GER: A1W038]. Doubleview identifies, acquires, and finances quality base metal exploration mining projects in North America and more specifically British Columbia, Canada. Doubleview increases shareholder value through strategic and quality Gold, Copper, and Silver projects acquisitions, and through the state of the art exploration methods in the industry.

Doubleview endeavours to increase the odds of exploration success and to mitigate investment risk through diversification. Doubleview’s announcement of the Gold Rich Porphyry Copper Discovery on its Hat project in Northwestern British Columbia sparked interest in the Company and this part of the famous Golden Triangle. Doubleview continues aggressive exploration on its Hat Project and plans to advance its other projects in 2021

DD:

So as mentioned in the title, there is major news upcoming with the resumption of drilling on the “Hat project”. The Tahltan Nation, an indigenous tribe in British Columbia, has ordered the mining to be halted due to interfering with the boundary’s of the tribes land. Now as of right now there leads to be no proof of when the drilling will continue, but I’m very bullish on this stock in the coming weeks as they have been drilling here for over 7 years, and have been making consistent deals with the tribe along the way.
.. If you ask me, I think the tribe is attempting to make a deal with Doubleview Gold. 

My current entry points are anything below .70 

And my price targets are:
 $1.50 bearish 🐻 
 $2.00 bullish 🐂

Again this is just some of my personal opinions, be sure to do your own research. I will continue to post updates on the Settlement between the company and the tribe.

Position: 3650 shares @ .68

46,2021-05-24,pennystocks,"Spearmint Resources had some news today about starting their Phase II work plan on the Goose Gold Project located less than 1 km from the New Found Golds discovery hole ""Keats"". The news of the company begining work programs on their gold projects at this time is very welcome news as the company is flirting with all time highs based almost exclusively on the success of their lithium project. With a number of projects expected to be advanced this year including the lithium I think this company is poised to move up to new levels again over the course of the next couple weeks and months. 

[https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/spearmint-begin-phase-ii-program-070100336.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/spearmint-begin-phase-ii-program-070100336.html) 

The company lists 14 projects on their website however I believe they will only be actively working on the ones that should provide the most value for the company over the next 12 months. With that in mind, I am going to list the ones I think have some potential for focus now. 

Goose Gold Project - Located within a KM of the Keats discovery, a discovey that has taken New Found Gold from penny stock to a massive market cap over 1.5B, this small claim has huge potential for a discovery. Based on its specific location it well may be a cash cow for the company if it wanted to sell to the other mining companies in the area once their work program is complete this year. I understand the planned program is for a small grid sampling mag survey and drilling on targets. We will need to see where the work goes but this will provide lots of news and updates as the program continues. 

Perron East Gold Project - Located in Quebec, in the area of the Amex Exploration Inc and Starr Peaks discoveries, Spearmint has several claim that have been advanced through work with Laurentia Exploration. Work to date has included some airborne magnetic surveys and sampling. Laurentia is highly respected and in demand in the area as they have been responsible for the other companies discoveries. Recent news from Spearmint highlighted flow though cash being raised  which as stated by they company will be primarily used to advance a drilling program on the Perron properties. These properties have several faults on them and have lots of potential for a significant discovery. 

Clayton Valley Clay project. - Located in Nevada bordering Cypress development. This project is where Spearmint is seeing most of it's current attention and value. The company completed an aggressive 10 hole drilling program in 2020 and hit the lithium bearing clay in every single hole. Samples from that program are currently undergoing metallurgy and initial tests showed 83% extraction. Currently these results are being confirmed but they are expected any time now. When the results are complete there will be a report done by Stantec that will highlight resource estimates and viability of the project. This is now an asset and whether the results indicate that more drilling is required or if they have enough for a reasonable estimate this project changes everything for this company. As lithium prices increase with demand this project will just add value. It is important to know,  other companies are spending millions on research and development in the area including CYP, ALB, PE and SLB. All of the investment directly helps SPMT in the proving of extraction methods make all the projects viable. 

Clayton Valley Brine Project. - Several claims for Brine production. Not currently drilled as brine wells are very cost prohibitive costing up to 1m per hole. Pure Energy is partnered with Schlumberger to build extraction plants and refinery in the area proving that investment in the brine is also viable. I will be looking forward to announcements on these claims in the future as it seems like a really easy fit in regards to continuing to develop assets. 

Several BC gold projects seem to be far down on the list so I don't expect them to get much attention with the focus being on eastern Canada based on the news however the company has a few projects that could be interesting. One is their vanadium project near  Chibougamau and another is the Case Lake Cesium Project. Both located near significant discoveries and with commodities that are on the critical list I think these could get some attention this year. 

Anyway, I am bullish on the company. I have 150K in shares currently and think it is going way higher. I expect lots of catalyst to come from the company virtually weekly for the foreseeable future so if nothing else we should learn were we stand in regards to the projects shortly. I won't provide any price target as until we know what the value of the Lithium is and what kind of results from the work programs are it will remain a very fluid situation. That said, I think it will keep chugging up aver the next several months. 

As always, do some DD for yourselves. This is looking like a trans-formative year for this company. More cash in bank than at any time in company history and several key work programs planned and ongoing. Not sure what else you would want on a JR exploration company.",nk5dvg,[],0

I encourage everyone to do their own DD, this is a HIGHLY UNUSUAL circumstance and I am playing it purely because I don't want to miss a potential 10x.

322,2021-05-25,pennystocks,"**Two things to start:**

1) I am not a financial advisor.  What follows in my interpretation after dong much research and consulting with my broker. Consult yours before making any decisions.

2) I own 102,500 shares currently. I really don't care if they go up or down over the next few weeks.  They will be worth the same regardless as I plan to hold until the Bankruptcy exit plan is concluded unless the price breaks $12.

**Now, what you came here for:** How much will I be paid for my shares of Hertz when Hertz executes its exit plan?

**There a 3 parts of the pay out:**

**1)** You will be paid $1.53 cash for each share, plus

**2)** Each shareholder will get an equity distribution on a prorated bases of 3% of the total purchase price of the entire company. Roughly $1.00 per share, plus

**3)** Then there are the warrants.  A little complicated, but hope you follow.  Exact wording from the agreement:  ""Each Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholder, has the right, but not the obligation, subject to and in accordance with the Rights Offering Procedures, to be eligible to subscribe for up to one (1) Rights Offering Share per 0.9554 shares of Existing Hertz Parent Interests that it holds, at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, subject to the individual limits included in the calculations in Item 2 of this Subscription Form."" So for example on 100 shares you would get (100/.9554) = 104.6682018002931. Which becomes 104 warrants because all rounding is down downward. Each warrant can then be purchased for $10. Here is the tricky part. You can convert by exercising the warrant, or you can sell the warrant itself. For this example we are going to sell the warrant. And here is why nobody can give you a concrete answer because the value of the warrant is COMPLETE SPECULATION. For my example I am going to assume that the new Hertz, with its reduced debt structure and red hot rental market, will get back to a pre-pandemic level of $20 per share. So you could sell each warrant for a $10 profit. ($20 share price less the $10 warrant purchase.) *Just a note: HTZ traded for as high as $46/share in the good times, which is what the new HTZ will be entering. The good times. Low debt. Hot market.*

**So here is the math on 100 shares:**

1) $1.53 cash out  (x) 100 = $153  **+**

2) $1.00  equity distribution (x) 100 = $100 **+**

3) 104 shares times $10 profit **=** $1040

Total income from you 100 shares would be $153 + $100 + $1040 = $1293. or **$12.93/share.**

If you currently owned the 100 shares for todays close price of $6.39 you investment is $639.

So staying it thru until the exit plan concludes and selling your warrants would net you $654 ($1293-$639).

**This is why I say I'm a bull on this stock. I believe that the total value of each HTZGQ share is really somewhere between $13-$20 per share. I will not sell unless the $HTZGQ crosses the $12 line before the exit plan is executed. Most estimates you see assume  being able to modestly sell your warrants for about $15 per share. Which means a price of around $7-8 ($1.53+$1+$5 warrant profit=$7.53) is the total value. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SEVERE UNDERVALUE.**

***But regardless, lets just say that the $7-8 is the call. you have a more than 20% upside in the current price of $6.39.***

 [Frequently Asked Questions - LED Funding (smartguard-energy.com)](https://smartguard-energy.com/frequently-asked-questions/) 

>WHAT MAKES YOUR COMPANY DIFFERENT FROM MANY OTHERS IN THE MARKET?  
>  
>**We design, install, finance & service LED lighting & solar installations with a national footprint, all with a 10 year warranty covering any material failures & related labor replacement costs. We structure our financing so that our clients are always cash flow positive throughout the 10 year term. This results in dramatic & compelling savings for our clients who typically achieve IRR’s of 30% or more on the cost of a LED lighting installation over 10 years. Bottomline: the only cost our clients are responsible for is the cost of the electricity which, of course, operates at significantly reduced wattage levels as more fully described below. We know of no other credible national company offering this value proposition.**   
>  
>  
>  
>HOW IS IT POSSIBLE BY INSTALLING LED LIGHT TO REDUCE YOUR ENERGY BILL BY MORE THAT 50%? I GUESS THE REAL QUESTION IS 50% OF WHAT?  
>  
>**LED lights reduce current existing wattage draws of greater than 50%. For example, if you replace a 100 watt fluorescent lamp with a 40 watt LED lamp, by the laws of physics you save 60 watts while maintaining the same luminosity. There can be no other result. We then quantify those direct energy savings using the following formula: (current existing wattage MINUS new LED lamp wattage) x (number of lights) x (run hours of operation) x (current kWh rate). In addition to the savings generated from the wattage reduction by switching from Fluorescent to LED lights there are additional savings generated. One is by the elimination of the lighting maintenance associated with fluorescent lights that cost goes away with LED lights plus a small adjustment for a reduction in AC usage since LED lights operate “cool”, ie., they don’t throw off heat which causes increased AC usage – that equals the total energy savings.**   
>  
>  
>  
>WHAT LED MANUFACTURER DOES YOUR COMPANY USE? NOT ALL LED'S ARE CREATED EQUAL!  
>  
>**You are absolutely correct with that statement. We use only major, nationally recognized Tier 1 LED lighting manufacturers with UL or DLC certifications that have unquestioned financial credibility to back up their 10 year material/labor warranty. Furthermore, because of our nationwide operations and large volume of LED business, we can obtain significant discounts from the lighting manufacturers which are not generally available to the public.**   
>  
>  
>  
>WHEN YOU SAY NO OUT OF POCKET COST CAN YOU PLEASE CLARIFY?  
>  
>**What we mean by saying that our clients have no out-of-pocket cost is that we finance 100% of the cost of the retrofit in the form of a loan or finance lease for usually a 5 year term at competitive interest rates. Therefore, during the loan or lease amortization period clients will be cash flow positive meaning that the realized energy savings will always exceed the financing cost by a minimum of 10% – this amount is usually significantly higher than 10%. Once the loan/lease amortization period is over, clients realize in cash the full amount of the calculated savings. Please be aware that there are significant tax benefits which our clients may be able to realize based on our finance structuring strategy.**

**SmartGuard Solutions** 

For this bit, it was not as simple to figure out as the Smartguard Solutions (SGS) site encompasses all of the services including robots-as-a-service, UV disinfection products, and all the energy products/services mentioned above. This is where many people do tend to get confused with all the different M&A activity. As far as I've come to understand it SGS, for the purposes of the FOMO Corp acquisition, will include the disinfection products, BUT NOT ROBOTICS.... for now. This is also on Vik's (FOMO's CEO) radar to acquire over time according to his bigger plans/goals he's discussed publicly. 

> SmartGuard-Solutions is marketing disinfection products with its own outreach and is negotiating joint marketing and sales agreements with several national maintenance and commercial real estate companies gaining time to market and scale advantages and extending its footprint throughout the country. The centerpiece of these marketing efforts is the offering of various types of Disinfection as a Service (“DaaS”) models to clients using funding that has been provided to SGS by institutional investors. SGS believes that these marketing efforts will fuel the growth of “as a Service” models which will provide short-term revenue and eliminate CapEx needs for its clients while, at the same time, provide the opportunity to generate long-term, annuity-type revenues. Such a recurring revenue model provides visibility to future revenues and cashflows and mirrors the strategy employed by SmartGuard Energy (https://smartguard-energy.com), also under definitive agreement for sale to FOMO. 

From Vik (FOMO CEO) regarding the real benefits of the Smartguard-Energy:

Now here's the big deal about SGS.... they were just awarded a non-competitive bid and procurement process award with the **US NAVY!!!!!!** The first order is for 25 units, but there is a $200,000 follow on order already being worked out and several more on the horizon with the military. Their product beat out 19 others and has been labeled a ""**unique or highly specialized” product.**  

&#x200B;

**HOW IT ALL COMES TOGETHER**

Well if haven't yet started assembling the pieces of the puzzle yourself, notice how each of the 3 entities mentioned above address a different need that buildings need, both with the current pandemic in mind but also the need for the world to address our energy issues. Having a company which can supply financing for these projects, the consultants/experts to design the systems, and the actual products themselves they are building a one-stop shop for disinfection and energy efficiency for large buildings and indoor public spaces. 

But wait.. .there's more.

I'll save you a lot of reading here and link to site with a short description.

Already acquired:

**Purge Virus -**  [Home - (purgevirus.com)](https://purgevirus.com/) 

Has a number of products, including smaller disinfection units based on UV light, portable solutions, and also bi-polar ionization in air ducts. Also, they procure PPE and offer installation services. Currently, their big news is a partnership with SOS (Safely Opening Schools) which makes available disinfection products to 130,000 public schools in the US.

**Independence LED** [Home | US Made 10 Year Warranty | Independence LED Lighting Solutions](https://independenceled.com/) 

Has similar services to SGE but they also manufacture their own lights in the USA. This is a big deal as they are also on the GSA Schedule which means GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, which also means other products offered by the acquisition targets, once the contracts are signed, will also be available for Gov't purchases!!!!!!!!

**Energy Intelligence Center**  [Home - Energy Intelligence Center](https://energyintelligencecenter.com/) 

EIC is an interesting one. They are all about optimization of existing systems for energy efficiency using Artificial Intelligence. I must say, I got lost down the rabbit hole on this one trying to understand it, but the tech behind it is very interesting. My very crude understanding of what is happening is using space inside buildings to store heat or cool air to redistribute later... honestly, I don't want to stick my foot in my mouth here so I'll just say read up... its fascinating to say the least. Here is a copy/past from their ""about"" page:

> The Energy Intelligence Center focuses on energy efficiency consulting and sustainability solutions. We start with the “low hanging fruit” by upgrading commercial property lighting and air conditioning as well as ventilation and refrigeration systems. We can save 50% or more on lighting with LEDs and save over 15% on HVAC, without changing any of the cooling equipment or impacting thermostat settings. For our energy intelligence, we integrate with existing Building Management Systems (BMS) and Building Automation Systems (BAS) as well as provide optimization for facilities that do not have BMS/BAS.

I've given you tons of information to rattle around your brains. Once I really got a handle on EVERYTHING that is going on here it was easy to see the value of the ""ecosystem"" (as he refers to it) Vik is trying to create. Each of these different pieces compliment each other in one way or another. When I thought one part might have been redundant, I found that they are quite different. For example, Ecolite manufactures LEDs, as does Independence LED, but Ecolite's manufacturing is done overseas allowing for two different tiers of products, depending on the clients wishes/budget/needs etc. 

The thing is that this isn't just a simple Covid play, or a Green energy play, or an AI powered efficiency, or a solar power play... ITS ALL OF THE ABOVE. 

Vik has long dreamt of creating CSTI 2.0. For those who aren't aware, CSTI was a tech company incubator in the late 90's early 00's that did quiet well for a long while. He wants to help these great ideas become even greater companies by having them work together to solve the problems facing building owners/operators/managers today while keeping in line with positive trends in all things energy related.

Right now, you can purchase this stock on a discount. Not long ago FOMC was trading over .02 on just the LOIs about SGE and Ecolite and the acquisition of Purge Virus. Now SGS is in the picture as well and funding is in place. If anyone is having trouble seeing the potential here then I don't know how else to explain it. 

The future will be bright here. Do you have the foresight to jump in early?

&#x200B;

Finally, check out this list of disclosures. Everything Vik does, he screams at the SEC and FINRA, look at me, this is what i'm up to.. .I'm telling everybody. So anyone who thinks something shady might be going on realize that NO ONE EVER would scream to regulators look at me, if they had something to hide.

Green technology innovators Cicle, Inc. and American Battery Metals Corporation [(OTCQB:ABML)](https://pr.report/TZR70fEq), an American-owned lithium-ion battery recycling technology and advanced extraction company with extensive mineral resources in Nevada, which is in the process of changing its name to American Battery Technology Company (""ABTC"") announced today a strategic partnership to create the first-of-its-kind centralized service operations for collection and recycling of electric vehicle batteries at Cicle EV ChargeParks. The ventures will team up to meet heightened consumer demand as all leading global automakers and truck fleets transition to electric mobility.

The strategic partnership solves a critical renewable energy supply problem for the fast-growing EV ecosystem. The growth of electric vehicles has so far relied on environmentally unfriendly and inefficient local power grids to supply energy for recharging short-range batteries in cars and trucks. The ABTC & Cicle ChargeParks collaboration creates a practical and highly advanced renewable energy technology solution.

Cicle ChargeParks patent-pending infrastructure is designed to recharge consumer EV's efficiently as well as house multiple ABTC collection points and operations across North America. ABTC may then collect the spent and damaged EV batteries and other lithium-ion products for recycling and core metals processing. Results: Cicle clean, safe & rapid EV charging facilities working collaboratively with ABTC green extraction and processing of metal battery components used to build high-range EV batteries that will drive the electric vehicle revolution.

""Together, Cicle and ABTC are creating an entirely new industry focused on carbon-negative facilities to accommodate a cutting-edge technology infrastructure, renewable energy operations and consumer experiences for the coming EV transformation,"" said Cicle CEO and Founder John Strisower. ""Cicle is designing its experiential and technical platform to capture, store and distribute clean power, including solar, wind, hydrogen as well as utilize mega-batteries so consumers and truckers will have the optimal EV experience for themselves - and the planet.""

""American Battery Metals Company is powering the future of clean energy through our advanced methodology for battery recycling,"" said Doug Cole, CEO of ABTC, which is expected to process about 20,000 tons of batteries annually with the fastest turnover of materials in the marketplace. ""Our team is thrilled to bring its world-class core metals chemical extraction and mineral recycling technology together with Cicle's ChargeParks infrastructure to create centralized, convenient collection of electric vehicle batteries and other lithium-ion powered tools and consumer electronics.""

As part of the concept, ABTC would support the recycling of EV batteries collected at future Cicle facilities. ABTC is proactively working to permit and construct a pilot battery recycling plant in Fernley, NV. The company is pioneering a closed-loop battery recycling process at this pilot plant that will separate and recover critical materials from end-of-life high-power batteries, as well as from defects and waste from battery manufacturing facilities. The recovered metals are refined to battery-grade specifications and then sold back into the supply chain in a true closed-loop process. This recycling process will be a critical component if the U.S. is to successfully meet the increasing demand for these critical materials.",nkouht,[],0
805,2021-05-25,pennystocks,"Details on Acquisition Announcement

Good day everybody,

We are continuing coverage on **Troika Media Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: TRKA**

Current price $2.96/share

We alerted TRKA shares at $2.92/share in Monday’s session. After reaching a high of $3.15 early in the session the shares pulled back closing at $2.96 (+1.37%) per share.

**Consider:**

· Tiny float.

· Trading 42% off IPO price one month ago

· The acquisition of Redeeem may act as a catalyst for the company’s value.

· Blue chip client list.

Yesterday we mentioned that TRKA listed sixty big named clients and we want to show them to you:

Coca-Cola, Peleton, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Victorias Secret, Sony, Viacom, UFC, Starz, Tiffany & Co.,

Hulu, HBO, LA Rams, ABC, Golf Chanel, Warner Brothers, EA Sports, Coach, PGA Tour, Verizon Media,

ESPN, SoFi, CBS News, Peroni, CNN, KRUG, Prime Video, CBS Sports, Pirelli, Belvedere, Venn, St. Ives,

STARZ, ABC, Raiders, Fox, Veuve Cliquot, LACMA, Turner, MlBam, Discovery, Fox Sports, TBS, NFL, NBC

Sports, Paramount, AMC, Cartoon Network, Nickalodean, AT&T, IMAX, Motortrend, FX, Sinclair, Yahoo 

Sports, Sundance, Comedy Central, Sundance, A&E, Ubisoft, Spectrum, Big Ten Network.

This list of blue-chip clients is at the **core of TRKAs success**. These companies represent many things to the company including, but not limited to large budgets to spend on consulting services and the ability to pay their bills in a timely fashion. 

The addition of Redeeem to the TRKA list of capabilities may increase business for the company significantly and quickly. Look at that list of clients and imagine which ones could want to move into crypto currency and block chain transactions.

**The company's operating units are:**

**Redeeem Acquisition** \- An entity created to facilitate the acquisition, just this week, of Redeeem, the crypto/blockchain/NFT company. [Redeeem](https://www.redeeem.com/) is a non-custodial peer-to-peer exchange that lets you buy, sell, and trade fungible goods for bitcoin.

**Troika Services, Inc. (Global)** \- a performance marketing and data intelligence company whose mission is to translate quantifiable metrics into actionable insights and empower businesses to connect with consumers, enhance engagement and optimize brand performance.

**Troika Design Group, Inc. (Los Angeles)** \- a strategic brand consultancy with deep expertise in entertainment, media, sports, and consumer goods and service brands. Troika provides a creative fan-centric approach to integrated brand strategy, creative, research, and technology solutions that builds long-term brand awareness for clients through equity and consumer loyalty.

**MissionCulture LLC (New York) -** Mission-Media Holdings Limited (London) and Mission Media USA Inc. (its non-operating subsidiary) (collectively, known as “Mission”) London-headquartered brand experience and communications companies that specializes in consumer immersion through a cultural lens, via live experiences, brand partnerships, public relations, including social and influencer engagement.

**Troika Labs -** a new division with the primary mission to leverage its expansive data and content creation capabilities to provide a fully integrated digital and creative offering to clients on a global scale.

Robert Machinist, Troika Chairman and CEO said, “as consumer media consumption shifts across the various media platforms, marketers require a partner who understands their business, has deep knowledge of the changing environment, and the creative, technology and data services to help them reach their audience.”

The key to success in that endeavor, is to know who you are creating your content for and that is some of the expertise found at TRKA. The company lists these three areas of expertise available to its clients:

Research and Insights

Branding

Consumer engagement

TRKA has an enviable position in the changing world of media because they understand the changes and other companies are willing to pay them for their expertise. The TRKA emergence as a public company is likely to attract more business from large cap companies who are more comfortable doing business under the transparency offered by listed firms.

Building or strengthening a brand is a big task for any sized company and more and more that involves a presence on all types of media, including social media. Building their brand can be an exhaustive and oftentimes expensive task when attempted in house with employees. And even worse, it can be ineffective.

TRKA has a FYE of June 30th so any accretive value attributable to the Redeeem acquisition may not be immediately apparent. We eagerly await the overall impact on TRKA from the Redeeem acquisition.

828,2021-05-25,pennystocks,"Why is there not much chatter around GRAMF? Everything I read about this company indicates its a potential multibagger.

My analysis:

GRAMF is a holding company focusing on recreational cannabis products. Currently it consists of two lines: Caliva, a delivery-based recreational cannabis company, and Monogram, a luxury cannabis brand. 

Currently GRAMF trades at $6.00 and 96mio shares outstanding for a market cap of $575m.

GRAMFs market cap of $575m is tiny compared to most of the well-known cannabis stocks which are all 1bio+. It has huge room for upside growth.

GRAMF currently holds close to $300m just in cash. Compared to its $575m market cap, this implies GRAMF has a floor price of  $3.26 JUST based on cash alone!

MARKET SHARE

The cannabis market is currently particularly fragmented without any clear brand winner. For example, in california the top 10 cannabis brands only make up 30% total sales in the region. GRAMF has a good chance to emerge as a leader in this field for two reasons.

1. Star Power: GRAMF is partnered with Jay-Z and his company Roc Nation (With artists like Rihanna, Meek Mill, Alicia Keys, et al). This is a huge outlet for cheap mass marketing, celebrity endorsements, and promotion. This will cement GRAMF as a brand in consumers’ minds.

2. M&A: GRAMF management indicates it plans to use its huge cash war chest to aggressively acquire competitors. These M&A deals will consolidate its foothold in the cannabis field and M&A news will also help spike GRAMF share price.

GROWTH

Recreational cannabis was just legalized in march 2021 in NY. This is a huge untapped market which GRAMF has indicated is a focus of expansion. With Jay-Z and his east coast reputation at the helm, GRAMF has a huge chance to become a brand name in the region. 

Federal legalization in 2021/2022 is a also potential catalyst for the cannabis sector as a whole. Cannabis legislation by all indications looks to be favorable under the current Biden administration and has bipartisan support. GRAMF is currently only traded OTC because current regulations do not allow cannabis stocks to be listed on exchanges. Once regulation reform comes and GRAMF gets listed, this will drive share prices up.

GRAMF has come off from its initial price of ~$11 when it first deSPAC’ed to around $6 currently due to weak Q1 revenues and margins and its relative quietness currently. Its now trading quite cheaply compared to other cannabis stocks out there, and if it can post better Q2 numbers, make a splash in M&A, and builds up its general brand recognition, expect the share price to skyrocket.",nkq28l,[],1
843,2021-05-25,pennystocks,"When you are born, you are born into structure, literal and metaphorical. Your teachers, parents, boss; all teach you STRUCTURE. The difference between this norm you are used to and the MARKET is the market has NO structure.

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'ApEs StIcK tOgEtHeR' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck.",nkq83u,[],0

Worksport's Bed Covers Charge EV Pickup Trucks from Ford, GM, Rivian and Atlis
Mentioned:	AAPL F GM NKLA TSLA WKSP
The first wave of EV pickup trucks is on the horizon and is anticipated to take over the automotive industry in the U.S.

Last week, Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) previewed its new electric F-150 Lightning pickup, a relatively inexpensive electric version of the most popular vehicle in America, during a visit by President Biden. Ford had taken 20,000 reservations in less than 12 hours since the truck was officially unveiled.

Other major contenders like GM (NYSE: GM), Rivian, Atlis, Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are also set to release their EV pickup trucks on American roads soon.

Although there are plenty of pros to owning an EV pickup truck, range anxiety is a common concern among many.

To get the maximum EV range possible, the concept of adding solar panels to tonneau covers or truck bed covers seems like the natural next step. But, this hasn't materialized in production yet.

Worksport (OTC: WKSP), a tonneau cover market leader, provides solutions for forthcoming EV pickup trucks with its proprietary technology â?? the TerraVisâ?¢ system.

About TerraVisâ?¢ Solar Cover System

The TerraVis solar tonneau cover system consists of four monocrystalline foldable solar panels that have an output of approximately 1kW.

The system should be able to add 12 to 15 miles (20 to 24 km) of range to an electric pickup truck, which is 30% of the power needed for the average daily commute under optimal conditions.

The company has already forged original equipment manufacturer (OEM) supply partnerships with two EV Truck nameplates, one of which is in partnership with Nissan.

The TerraVis system is expected to cost less than 5% of the overall cost of a pickup truck. Furthermore, TerraVis is in development now to give current pickup truck owners access to EV tech without investing in a new truck and to further leverage the power of their electric truck in the future. It is a future-proof product that truck owners will bring as they upgrade and expand with more modular storage.

Not a One-Trick Pony

The TerraVisâ?¢ system's application is not just limited to extending the mileage of EV pickup trucks.

The battery system, Terravis 'Cor' can also be touted as a mobile power plant. The system will take power from the cover and store it in modular battery packs â?? storing 1.5kWh of energy in up to four batteries. This can be stored and transported in the truck's bed using the TerraVisâ?¢ mounting system.

The batteries can power almost anything with its built-in 2kWh power inverter from the job site or campsite which can be used in the event of a natural disaster or power outage.

The unique feature of the battery system is that it can be available for purchase as a standalone consumer product â?? even if you're not a truck owner.

Massive Potential

Worksport has been around for over a decade and has been successful with its lineup of five unique truck bed cover models. The company has an intellectual property portfolio of over 30 assets of utility patents and trademarks.

The company competes in many multibillion-dollar markets. The EV market is estimated to increase to $30 billion by 2030. This value may be much more than what is estimated with rumors about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) joining the bandwagon with its first generation of EVs. According to The Korea Times, Apple is close to signing an agreement with LG Magna e-Powertrain. If the agreement were to take place, we could expect a prototype to be teased in early 2024.

The specialty-equipment market has a market value of over $12 billion as pickups alone account for over 25% of the market. The other big markets include the tonneau cover market ($600 million), the battery storage system market ($2.9 billion in 2020).

With the cumulative size forecasted over $24 billion by 2025, Worksport stands a chance to generate revenue over 1.5 billion, assuming a 5% market share. The company's market stretches beyond just the U.S., into Canada, Latin America, Australia and more.

Worksport currently has over $10 million in cash and cash equivalents and no long-term debt. In February 2021, the company closed its oversubscribed Reg-A offering, raising $4 million. To date, the company has received over $2.9 million from the exercise of warrants associated with its Reg-A offering and has also raised an additional $3 million from non-brokered Private Placement.

'TerraVis is the culmination of Worksport's effort to look beyond our core business producing the highest quality tonneau covers for all truck owners,' said Steven Rossi, CEO and founder of Worksport. 'We're dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what a truck accessory can offer, and to do so, we are looking to the future of EV trucks to bring that technology one step closer to today's truck owners. Our solar-powered tonneau cover will allow anyone to generate and store power for use in their daily life â?? work and sport.'",nkqdd8,['AAPL'],0

I am confused, am I not allowed to sell unsettled funds?

Like if I sell a stock today and it is unsettled funds and use those same unsettled funds to buy another stock and then sell that stock again with funds that have not settled this is not allowed?

I thought that's why margin accounts beat the cash accounts or nah? 

So weird when I google it it says 

""Trading with unsettled funds can lead to account restrictions and is ill-advised. With margin accounts, you do not need to wait for a trade to settle before reusing the capital.""

885,2021-05-25,pennystocks,"Back in January I wrote a [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/l4ny82/silicon_valley_ai_company_ssft_is_the_next_aitx/) about this AI company and put this gem in a lot of people's radar.  In the following 2 weeks the share price increased from $0.10 to $0.40. Then came the bear market and along with all the other penny stocks SSFT fell back to where it started(at least for me) to $0.10 again. 

I accumulated more Sonasoft stocks in both periods, I currently have around 1.2 million shares. The reason that I did that was not to make a quick profit, it was simply investing in my future. I'm too busy to follow the markets everyday and do day trading. And with my past experience I saw that swing trading a discounted penny stock is much more profitable then taking risks every day.

Last week two important things happened. 

1- Annual financials are released

2- Investors meeting took place.

These two events strengthened my confidence in my choice of investment. We are clearly in on a company that's destined to become a Nasdaq star.

Before we start with financials, let me explain what this company is all about.

SSFT used to be a data management company in Silicon Valley serving global clients for about 20 years. Company shifted it's focus from Data Management to an AI first solutions company in the early 2019 and went on with acquiring 3 AI companies and talents. 

Their newly created AI platform Saibre (former NuGene) is currently used as a POC (Proof of Concept) product although even at this stage it started generating revenues.

Company's AI department annual revenue increased 15x (to 780k) YoY. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/abjpi1fgm9171.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d092b078dd01efe7f5b2ae71268003d61d0a18a

Despite 2020 being a catastrophic year for many companies, Sonasoft managed to compete with previous year's revenue.

2020 total revenue has reached **$8,935,27**1 with an additional **$3,702,000** deferred revenue that is not added into 2020's numbers because the service in return has not been completed yet.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qek8u3y6o9171.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=535ff55e720db96182be7e16f0e7e6cd5ede3e00

So even in the worst year where companies cut of their costs drastically Sonasoft managed to reach **over 10 million USD in revenues**. This also happened when they were building up their AI platform to become market ready. **The AI bots that's already contributing the revenue will be bringing in recurring revenues when they are fully ready before the end of Q3 this year.**

Besides promising numbers everyone was curious about hearing the direction for the current management. Back in March, a couple of us reached the company and asked for a better PR channel and transparency. Company responded immediately and for the first time they organized an Investor's meeting with all of the top officials.

I'll share two short videos with CFO Rob Baumert and CEO Mike Khanna answering questions from investors. 

# Sonasoft CFO Rob Baumert explaining potential company value

https://reddit.com/link/nkqueb/video/wddgstujo9171/player

To reiterate, the company valuations are typically 20x-100x in AI industry.   
At $0.10 share price and about $50 million market cap with about $10million revenues Sonasoft is a massively discounted AI company at this stage. That is mostly because their flagship product is not on the market yet and they are still a OTCQB company.

&#x200B;

# ""What is the revenue potential of Saibre AI?"" Sonasoft CEO answers. 

https://reddit.com/link/nkqueb/video/jfz4wyybp9171/player

Sonasoft signed a revenue share agreement with Fidelity National (FIS) back in 2020. According to Mike each bot will bring in at least 180k upto 500k and more and with partnerships like FIS they will be reaching thousands of clients who will be creating multiple bots. **The recurring revenues that he's talking about is not per company, it's per bot!**

# Nasdaq listing 

Almost all the penny stocks promise to be on Nasdaq or higher level markets one day, but maybe less than 10% of those really become one. This wasn't something that I'd take serious unless there were some solid steps towards that direction and the CEO announced a new addition to the team, Paul Schlosberg. I'm not sure if he will be an advisor or a board member but something sticks out in his Resume ""**He enjoyed over 10 years as a member of The NASDAQ Stock Market Listing Qualifications Committee in Washington**""

[https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulschlosberg/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulschlosberg/)

If the requirements haven't changed $3 minimum share price is required to uplist. So there you go, people who ask what's the price target is for this, the first PT is $3 and I think this will happen earliest  between Dec 2020 and Aug 2021. Given that they hired this person for it. All the other requirements are already met for Nasdaq.

&#x200B;

# What else?

They also gave a detailed demonstration of their SAIBRE platform. I'm a UI designer and from my point of view they created a product that's really well thought, easy to use and efficient. 

Here are some screenshots of SAIBRE where they were creating new bots to go through and learn massive data in minutes.

&#x200B;

**Here are some highlights from the meeting**

* AI platform patent application submitted at the end of 2020 .  
* Replacement of Nugene with Saibre.  
* NuGene reached limits, not enterprise scale. It was not built with easy of use which is a huge differential. Container model was causing hesitations with clients. 
* Saibre in contrast is easy to use, scalable, efficient. Anybody can use Saibre, there's no tech leakage, customers can deploy a new bot with a single click. 
* Company did an internal audit for engineering and sales. 
* Developed agile approach to respond customer needs efficiently.  
* OEM partners, last few months, ramped up work.  
* Before the end of q3 bots will be ready. 

**Rob Baumert CFO:** 

* Big book of sonasoft is written.  
* Significant changes to financial structure.  
* Impact of discountinued operations. Econnect and Sonavault were loss makers and not part of AI. They were a drag. So they let them go. Cost savings are much more.  Now more focus on AI success. 
* They looked at spending during 2020 reduced costs greatly during this period. Monthly cash burn is half now.  
* 2021 coming with growth and recovery. 
* Core team is strengthened.  
* Increased AI expenses, FIS parnership strengthened. AI segment rev increased 15x. 
* Secured their financial runway with funding. 

 **Max Lee Head of AI :** 

* Saibre is a complete AI bot solution.  
* We're on the shoulders of giants. Learned from previous systems. 
* Nugene was a jack of all trades.  But required manpower and scaling was hard. Custom coding was a problem. 
* Took the best parts and built Saibre. 
* This AI is getting built to challenge all AI projects. Thousands of images are required to separate a dog picture from a cat picture for an AI. All need to be labeled and requires a lot of data. Other models requires vast amounts of data. If the data is noisy or mislabeled system can't learn. 
* Current SSFT IP is like a young child. You give a child one example and the kid learns from a single experience. 
* Kid understands that its a ball even if he partially sees the ball. The new IP is working similar to that. 
* Future algorithms will take advantage of this basis.
* Max is also getting inspiration from biology and neurology. 
* Less time to deploy with less resources

**Caroline Zaborowski - VP of Data Science:** 

* All AI systems need datascientists. And Datascientists need efficient, easy to use and flexible systems
* Current systems are time consuming. Saibre is reducing time to value. 
* They redesigned the workflow, less time is spent on data cleaning, reusing the components and more collab between data scientists which is really important. 
* Can be used by experienced data scientist and a regular user. 
* SSFT AI solution is far more adoptable by clients. 

So there's still a lot to talk and tell about Sonasoft. The story is long.

The future of this company have 2 possible directions in my view.

1- Will become a one stop platform for AI solutions that all size of enterprises can use. AI is not for the most sophisticated or the most wealth and big anymore. They are bringing it to the masses.   
They will be listed in Nasdaq and keep on growing from there into a multi-billion dollar company.

2- As soon as they are listed on Nasdaq, with a working product and massive potential they will be acquired by giants.

But If you are ready to invest for your future with optimum risk/reward, SSFT share price has found it's bottom at $0.10, has been here for a while but not for so long. Buy it and HODL guys. 

My first target is above $5 but I wont be selling it all at that level. We're only at the beginning.

928,2021-05-25,pennystocks," 

OCUP has had 4 evaluations by analysts in 2021, so these are recent, and all have given it a target price above 20. That would multiply the current price by roughly five. An any time we can have an investment multiply that way, it's worth looking into it.

So before anyone claims I'm a pumper: this is a super small clinical stage pharma (not a pennystock though) with a small pipeline running mostly on one product/idea, at least in the near future. It's a risky investment. Do your own D/D. Also, tomorrow they are hosting a webinar, so you can listen firsthand and form an opinion. 

Now for the D/D. Why are all analysts so optimistic about OCUP?

Well, anyone that has ever gone to the ophthalmologist to have their eyes/eyesight examined, will understand this one.

When we go to the eye dr., we are given eyedrops to enlarge our pupil. The black part of the eye. The black part of the eye, is like a hole. So the larger the hole, the better look the doctor can have into our eye. This is a VERY simplified explanation.

It takes at least 25 minutes for our pupil to dilate. After the exam, (anyone who has experienced it knows this), it takes a few hours for it to get back to normal. During those hours, we can't see well, our vision is blurred, we can't read a book, watch a screen or drive a car.

Some of us just take a bus home and wait it out. But for many of us, that time with blurred vision means we are going to miss more hours of work. That recovery time is worth money.

Well, currently there is no solution for this situation. You go to the eye doctor, your pupil is dilated, then you waist several hours after the visit waiting for your eyesight to recover.

OCUP have developed the eyedrops antidote. Very simple: eyedrops you receive at the end of the visit, which will bring your sight back to normal within roughly the same time frame it took for the pupil to dilate (about 20-25 minutes).

What this means is, anyone, worldwide, that goes to consult with an ophthalmologist, everyday, any day, that's the market for this product. 100 million visits pe year in the USA alone. And there is no alternative. They will OWN that market. Just imagine this: a product that every eye dr. around the world will have that will drastically improve the patient's experience by simply receiving some eyedrops that bring the eyesight to normal. You can go back to work, use the computer, drive etc.

That alone, is a good enough reason for betting on OCUP. That's worth billions. But it actually gets way better for four reasons:

1. This product has other uses, we are not going to get into all of them because they refer to more specific eye issues.
2. They are in Phase three, using a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.
3. There is an additional HUGE use for this product.
4. The current market cap is very very low.

What the 505 pathway basically means is that the active ingredient, the main ingredient of this new product has already received FDA approval, twice. So what OCUP does is use the data that already exists about this compound to avoid a lengthy approval path. In other words: it makes the approval of the product way faster. And after 7 very successful trials involving over 200 patients, they are in the last stages of moving towards an approval request (which, as explained, can be obtained much faster). So we are talking about approved product this year.

As for the other huge market for OCUP. OCUP is using the same technology they developed to apply it, with slight changes of course, to different situations. One such situation is presbyopia. Don't let the name scare you, it's very simple: the need for reading glasses. Pretty much everyone who reaches a certain age needs reading glasses. It's part of the process of getting old. Almost 2 billion people worldwide suffer from it. That's how big the market is.

OCUP are again, creating something that doesn't really exist: eyedrops that will ""cure"" or delay presbyopia. Basically they can avoid, if not totally then partially, the need for reading glasses, simply by using eyedrops. A huge market, also with no real competitors.

There is more to write about OCUP and it's small but amazing pipeline. But just these things I mention is the reason I personally loved this find. I'm slowly increasing my position and waiting. It's a long position. It's not a company that creates huge news. So this is about buying cheap now and waiting. If the analysts are roughly right, we can quadruple our investment within 12 months. I'll take it.",nkrbpf,[],0
