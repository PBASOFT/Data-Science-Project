447,gz9rz5a,2021-05-24,t1_gz8r4n9,wallstreetbets,"Especially when TSLA made more than 100% of its profits in both carbon offset credit sales and speculative Bitcoin profits. It’s not really profitable on its underlying car business yet. And now that every major manufacturer is taking EV’s seriously TSLA will be facing big competition. And multiples for boring car manufacturers, EV or otherwise, are like 10. Not 580. 

All of Elon’s hubris, sending cars into space, calling his cars “self-driving” when they aren’t fully autonomous, etc...will catch up to him. I view him as a great hype man, but o don’t see him as a serious CEO who wants to put in the work and relentlessly crush other auto makers (the way that Steve Jobs or Bill Gates wanted to crush their competition). Nor do I view him as being as obsessively pathological with growing TSLA’s market penetration as Bezos and Zuckerberg are with AMZN and Facebook. 

He kind of seems like a bright, rich goofball, who is really insecure and needs Twitter confirmation on his random tweets. Sure he does interesting things, and Space-X is a technological marvel, as are Tesla’s, but can he really run those wildly different business AND do home solar, hyper loop, boring company, Mars colonies....

It just strikes me as a guy who likes playing with shiny toys, and his toys are really exciting, aggressive, and emotionally appealing new technologies and approaches. But it’s frankly too much for him to pull off, and profits just aren’t there in cars to make TSLA this valuable. 

And now that Bitcoin is tanking, if he didn’t sell TSLA’s holdings, they will need to write that down next quarter. And the regulatory offset credit sales are drying up as well...",[],0

The legacy players make their money on higher end trucks sold to consumers. That is the same reason GM and Ford have reduced rental fleet sales. They have tremendous costs to cover.

LMC is in a totally different place. Low overhead and going after a specific market segment. They have a solid plan, but they must execute and sell quality trucks to get a foothold.

Market cap means nothing in this conversation. It's apples to oranges and is nothing more than a talking point.

I own both Ford and GM stock, but not for the same reason I own LMC. They're industry slatwarts. I view $RIDE as a growth stock and accept the inherent additional risk.",[],0

Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my body finally surrenders, I weep, as my school and my city go under. I fucking hate gaming laptops.",[],1

Well, they did say 400 flights ""per spaceport"" to generate that $1 billion, so the real question is ""How many spaceports are they expecting to have?"" They only have one right now, implying the $400k ticket price, but it would be substantially less per ticket if they're factoring-in 1, 2, or 5 additional spaceports to produce that amount of revenue.  


Regardless, this isn't a theme park where customers will return time and again. Even $67k for a 2- to 3-hour ride is a hefty one-and-done kind of adventure, even for those that can afford it.

I think a ""real squeeze"" will only happen when a substantial milestone is achieved and is advertised effectively. Spread far and wide. Word gets out.   
The Hindenburg (or whatever the F they're called) report was a hit-piece. That alone, merits an epic short-squeeze. You reap what you sow.

A 6.50 jump this morning and damn close to 90 bucks a stock that may 10th was trading for 64 bucks and people were saying it was overvalued THEN.

People need to stop thinking of RBLX as just a game and can't understand why it's so big, RBLX is the current minecraft/youtube/steam of younger kids and if it doesn't screw this is up it will have them locked in for decades.

 It's a platform that 'content' creators and streamers will use to get their stuff out to people who will in turn buy into roblox ingame currency to buy said content that those 'content' creators will cash out that currency but with fee's paid to the company to get paid in real money much like YouTube allowed people to monetize their videos but still got a cut.

Hell there is a video game studio ""Uplift Games"" now making Games just in Roblox after their breakout hit Adopt Me! became so popular that it's ingame numbers rivaled CS:GO and this is before Roblox moves onto even more kid friendly platforms like the Switch. I guess what I'm saying is I like this stock.",[],0

Let f be a map from the naturals to the power set of the naturals, and let A be the set of all natural numbers x such that x is not an element of f(x).  Obviously, A is in the power set.  Then, because f is a bijection, there exists some natural number y such that f(y)=A.  Now we ask, is y an element of A?  If y is not an element of A, then because A is the set of all those elements that are not an element of their image, y must be an element of A.

If you're a long term investor, it doesn't matter very much at what point in that timeline you bought QQQ shares, because they'd be worth a fucking fortune today regardless.  


If you're a permabear buying puts in 1999 or 2000, it looks at first glance like the shorting opportunity of a lifetime. But you would've run into both psychological and solvency issues trying to short for that length of time. You would have continued to lose lots of money at an alarming rate, right up until the March 2000 peak. Then unless you timed your exit perfectly in mid April 2000, you would've got fucked by the dead cat bounce in September of 2000, and probably ran out of money to buy puts about that time and forced to become a prostitute selling $20 blowjobs in the alley over by Wendy's. But if you somehow held on and continued buying QQQ puts, you would've made a bunch of money on them eventually. Perhaps enough to almost break even on all your losses incurred since 1999.  


I'm not trying to make comparisons between then and now; I do think we're in a bubble, but it's not at all similar to the 2000 or 2008 ones and unlikely to play out in the same way. The takeaway is that speculative bubbles inflate over a long period of time, and when they do pop it can take months. You could be the next Burry, but more likely you will just get buried. So you basically have to wait until a downtrend is confirmed before buying puts. If you try to Nostradamus the market as if there will be a sudden rug pull during a time when the Fed is injecting $125 bil per month, you will have a bad time. And by you I mean me.",[],0

Look, I don't know where AMC will eventually end up.  Even I doubt it could get to 100k-500k+, but I could see it at least getting up to 1K or higher easily.

If we want to play the numbers game of AMC vs GME, though, GME is currently at $186.52 a share vs. AMC's $13.69

If someone dropped $1000 into GME, they'd have 5.36 shares.  If someone dropped $1000 into AMC, they'd have 73.04 shares.

Let's just say we add the 43M shares into AMC, making it 491.29M shares vs GME's 57M float.    That means AMC has 8.61x shares.

Let's compare, say if GME went to 10,000 and AMC went to ONLY 1,000.

Your $1000 invested into GME would net you $53,600.

Your $1000 invested into AMC would net you $73,040.

All pre-tax, of course.

Thus, right now, AMC looks to be the better investment over AMC no matter how you look at it, even if it's final stock value is 10x lower than GME in the end.","['GME', 'AMC']",0

The K shaped recovery means we are currently very fractured: the wealtheir amongst us (most of here including probably anyone with money in stocks) have access to cheap capital that can handle interest rates going up. However, the poorer amongst us - just look at the media household income - will be hurt by rising interest rates and rising business costs since they're mostly likely those going to be hit by layoffs, etc.


The fed will insist that the inflation is transitory and won't raise rates until is absolutely has to. Politically, there's 0 appetite for doing this since it will hurt retirement funds. I think we'll print another few trillion later this year and kick the can down the road some more.

En masse I think that people who held through the rollercoaster of the past are likely to keep doing so. But some people are inevitably going to get fed up, bored or begin to doubt that there'll be a big squeeze.

I may be wrong but that’s my stance on it. I’m sure some people profit took, but I think FOMO crowd would have been major sellers. The ones that did research and bought whilst it was below 12 are the ones who know the “squeeze DD”. That is the only thing AMC has going for it. Otherwise it’s not a particularly attractive stock.

It doesn’t mean game stop will crash and burn but they won’t be growing. They rely heavily on used games. That’s where most of their profit comes from. I assure you I worked there for 4 years. I was a manager for 2 1/2. They constantly push you to sell used everything over new because the new products don’t make much money.  It’s just common sense that as video games move further away from using disks then their profit begins to shrink. It’s why over the past 10 years every time you go in there they have more and more stuff cluttering the store like clothes, toys, and now pc parts that they don’t even have room for because their stores are too small. They are looking for new ways to survive and compete. The problem is they end up in a weird place where they have problems competing. Clothing and toys people don’t go there just for that. They go to other places that specialize in that stuff. They just have customers buying it when they come in for games which will shrink over time. 

It’s easy to look at OP or the other people trashing what I’m sayings posts and realize they are almost all GME related. Ever since the squeeze there has been this cult like following of people who quite honestly don’t seem to even understand why or how that happened. They don’t understand fundamentals of trading or investing. They just have this dream of GameStop being 1000+ a share. It’s all rockets and diamond hands. It’s just not realistic.",['GME'],0

Your example with the two houses ( a good example by the way) is a consequence of inflation too. Rich people have assets (stocks, houses, ...) The prices of these assets are rising during inflation while the money at the bank accounts stays the same. So inflation takes money from the poor and the middle class and give it to the rich. It leads to a widening of the wealth gap. Think about all the countries with wide wealth gaps. Think about most of the countries with wide wealth gaps have high inflation. Compare Italy to Germany or the USA to Mexico.  And when your wealth gap has grown it makes sense to replace 10 houses for middle class people against two houses for rich people.",[],0

Throughout the last 20 years there have been many writings about underground tunnels running throughout Southern California into Nevada and the naval test range, area 51and other places. Some of which are thought to exit into the SoCal offshore where tons of ufo sightings have been going on since 1945
Over the last few months, and you can check this, we have had large amounts of earthquakes, all between 3.0 and 4.0 in the areas where these supposed tunnels exist
History shows the Air Force building nuclear powered tunnel borers for years and even have patents on them
Now stay with me. These tunnels have also been discussed concerning a massive multilevel base under a specific mountain in New Mexico where US and Extraterrestrials cohabiting together are doing extremely strange things
There was even talk about a minor skirmish where Americans and aliens got into it there in a fight with deaths on both sides
With the so called sudden uptake in sightings, I believe that these craft have been here for sometime and the US is completely aware and involved in it
Do you DD and you will be amazed it is the most top level work in the world
Did you know our navy was involved in a huge fight in Antarctica with UFOs way back towards the end of WW2
We got our butts kicked also these quakes here in California in my mind are either more tunneling going on or destruction of said tunnels to keep things in, or out",[],0
