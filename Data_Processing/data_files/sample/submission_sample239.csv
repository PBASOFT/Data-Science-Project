175,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"**Preamble:** The current jump in US consumer prices has understandably spooked investors. The current CPI numbers stand at 4.2 percent which is the highest they have been since Sep 2008 (the increase was almost 4x of what was expected). 

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let’s be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) – i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

”Money printer go brrr” was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn’t announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed’s explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

177,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"Value investing and long term holding might not be synonimum with wallstreetbets, but I don't care, because I want to get this stock as much attention as I can now that I hold it.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

195,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"Postmates completely changed their app, deleted thousands upon thousands of restaurants from their customer's menus and serial-customers (folks who order 2-3+ times a week) have been cut off from being able to order for tens-hundreds of thousands of people.  Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.

We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.

And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

208,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn’t brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD’s Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> “While all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we’re risking is just different stovepipes,” Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. “**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**” 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM’s Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

218,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,[],1
220,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"The point is that senior employees of public companies are required to make their transactions public. It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I’ve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

221,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"Stock split of TTD is coming soon. With the drop of prices recently, it seems like a good time to get in as the hype will drive prices up prior to the split and also the lower prices will increase demand after the split. 

Overall, the stock itself is undervalued given the market cap vs revenue with the projected growth rate over the next 3 years. Also, they just figured out a way to work around google's new algo which means business will continue to flow

I just got in today, though I have been wanting to get in for the last week (had to clear some other positions) and looks like I lost about 10% potential gains (I shouldnt have even thought about my other shitty positions!). I am looking at at least 20% more gains over the next 3 months

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

230,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"The Gates Foundation sold Apple, which I find a bit weird, and they sold Twitter which I agree with. They bought a bunch of stock in a company called Coupang Inc (CPNG) - a South Korean company that focuses on e-commerce - home goods, food, etc. - looks a lot like Walmart in the U.S. 
Selling their Apple stock which has a .22 cent quarterly dividend (which paid the Foundation over $220,000 per quarter) to buy CPNG that has NO dividend at all sends off all kinds of BUY alarms in my book. CPNG closed up $2.49 today - $40.50 a share. I picked up shares early today. Keep your eyes on this one!",nk7n4k,['AAPL'],0
232,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"I've decided to do away for the time being with dividend investing and decided to go all in on the Wheel strategy with BNGO. Last week I sold calls for the first time and I decided to go all in. I had about $2,780 invested in QYLD which gave me about $343 a year and $28.6 a month. I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term. 

Hopefully I can update in a month on the status and outcome of my current play. All I can say is that it literally can't go tits up.",nk85dk,[],0

242,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"Compass is trading at a market cap that is on the high end of their projected revenue this year. This indicates some good room to move upward. The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don’t think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play. Their revenue growth over the next few years should drive it up nicely.",nkdxwl,[],1
244,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I’m primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn’t necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can’t necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what’s to come. So, let’s take a look at PENN’s growth. 

In 2015 Penn’s revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN’s revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN’s debt to asset ratio of 80% isn’t terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN’s partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

What people aren't realizing is that RSUs converted today and all insiders automatically had a portion of their RSUs sold in order to cover the taxes.

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,['AAPL'],0
254,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"Feel free to rag on me.  I am not an economist.  I just like trying to sound like I'm smart.  That's S-mart, baby.  


Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.  There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".  The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.  Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.  In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.  In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.    


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.  While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?  Good question.  I don't know yet.  Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.  Another good question.  I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?  The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.  They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.  This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.  *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**    


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.  And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?  I don't know, but here's a scary graph.  So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.  Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.  Not significantly.  After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.  So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.  Doesn't seem like much.  But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.  I went down another rabbit hole.  1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?  The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.  Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.  Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).  It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.  After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.  And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.  When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?  A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.  But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.  

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.  Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.  

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).  The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.  Tomorrow is Richmond.  Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.  But it's on a holiday weekend.  So responses should be muted.  If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.  If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

# Does SelfWealth impose any restrictions on stocks such as GameStop (GME)?

* 25 days ago

&#x200B;

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME –  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.  These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,"['GME', 'AMC']",0

As most knows well in [***“There Is No Way, This Doesn’t End Badly,”***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/there-is-no-way-this-bull-market-doesnt-end-very-badly/) virtually every measure of fundamental analysis suggests the markets are very expensive. 

Let's dig in 

 *10-year forward returns are below zero historically when the price-to-sales ratio is at 2x. There has never been a previous period with the ratio climbing to near 3x.”* 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mok55matq8171.png?width=923&format=png&auto=webp&s=373aed0c5936f724473ccc367778191d6ca08b70

 Whether it is Market Capitalization to GDP, CAPE, Tobin’s Q, or Price-to-Sales, the problem with all valuation measures is they are **horrible market-timing indicators.** As shown in the chart below, **if you had gone to cash when the S&P first crossed into** ***“expensive”*** **territory greater than 23x CAPE, you would have missed most of the current bull market cycle.**  

&#x200B;

Being doggedly attached to valuations and fundamentals can prove just as dangerous to long-term returns as getting caught in a bear market. **While a bear market does indeed destroy capital, not participating in a bull market has an equal impact on ending results.** 

An excellent example of the problem, shown below, with purely using fundamentals to manage a portfolio is the performance chart between *“momentum”* and *“value”* since 2009.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gunafgc0r8171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89d412aec69578bff108852fb42bf9a43594f99

 

Of course, this is the direct result of sustained ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy) and successive rounds of monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve.

Conclusion :

 **However, as is the case with every bull market, a strongly advancing market covers up the many investing mistakes investors make. It is the ensuing bear market that reveals them in the most brutal and unforgiving of outcomes.**  

 

**You can not successfully** ***“time the market.”*** Trying to be *“all in or out”* of every twist and turn of the market is impossible. **However, that doesn’t mean you must be passive and let it all wash all over you.**

There is a clear advantage to providing risk management to portfolios over time. **The problem is that most individuals cannot manage their own money because of** ***“short-termism.”*** *(As shown by shrinking holding periods)*

&#x200B;

 **Of course, with the media and Wall Street pushing the** ***“you are missing it”*** **mantra as the market rises, can you blame the average investor** ***“panic”*** **buying market tops and selling market bottoms?** 

&#x200B;

 I do understand there is a significant risk. [***If Jack Bogle is correct***](http://www.businessinsider.com/jack-bogle-warns-of-two-50-percent-market-declines-in-next-10-years-2013-4)***,*** *things* could be very disappointing. Or, as Seth Klarman from Baupost Capital once stated:

>***“Can we say when it will end? No. Can we say that it will end? Yes. And when it ends and the trend reverses, here is what we can say for sure. Few will be ready. Few will be prepared.”***

 

We saw much of the same mainstream analysis at the peak of the markets in 1999 and again in 2007. New valuation metrics, IPO’s of negligible companies, valuation dismissals as *“this time was different,”* and a building exuberance were common themes. **Unfortunately, the outcomes were always the same.** 

Our goal is to prepared.

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,[],0
818,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn’t brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD’s Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> “While all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we’re risking is just different stovepipes,” Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. “**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**” 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM’s Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

Revenue for the quarter came in at **$747.27 million versus** the **consensus estimate of $620.18** million which is **200% revenue growth from Q4 2020**

Q1 EPS of ($0.48), in-line with the analyst estimate of ($0.48

By end of the year, # of markets will be doubled from last year

For the second quarter of 2021, revenue is expected to be between **$1.025 billion and $1.075 billion,** which represents **41% sequential growth over 1Q21** at the midpoint of the expected range. Adjusted EBITDA1  is expected to be between ($5) million and $5 million, which represents breakeven margin at the midpoint of the expected range

AND, Opendoor has about $**2 billion in cash.** If you follow the industry, you know that M&A is a real winner which will give them to expand even faster to additional markets.

I can't really think of many stocks that are better than Opendoor. Lots of potential here and it's at the price it jumped to on DA. It is more than 50%+ off of its highs and I think it represents a great buying opportunity as of right now.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

828,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,[],1
830,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"The point is that senior employees of public companies are required to make their transactions public. It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Last week I sold calls for the first time and I decided to go all in. I had about $2,780 invested in QYLD which gave me about $343 a year and $28.6 a month. I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

852,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"Compass is trading at a market cap that is on the high end of their projected revenue this year. This indicates some good room to move upward. The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don’t think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

854,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I’m primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn’t necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can’t necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what’s to come. So, let’s take a look at PENN’s growth. 

In 2015 Penn’s revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN’s revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN’s debt to asset ratio of 80% isn’t terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN’s partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

What people aren't realizing is that RSUs converted today and all insiders automatically had a portion of their RSUs sold in order to cover the taxes. They was an automated event applied equally across the entire company including the c-suite and there was no option to prevent the sale and pay in cash.

859,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"**tl;dr: PLUG has rallied on relief from the completion of its restatement, but accounting red flags remain -- and the economics are as bad as ever.**

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,['AAPL'],0
864,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"Feel free to rag on me.  I am not an economist.  I just like trying to sound like I'm smart.  That's S-mart, baby.  


Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.  There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".  The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.  Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.  In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.  In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.    


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.  While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?  Good question.  I don't know yet.  Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.  Another good question.  I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?  The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.  They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.  This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.  *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**    


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.  And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?  I don't know, but here's a scary graph.  So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.  Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.  Not significantly.  After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.  So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.  Doesn't seem like much.  But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.  I went down another rabbit hole.  1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?  The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.  Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.  Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).  It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.  After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.  And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.  When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?  A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.  But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.  

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.  Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME –  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.  These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,"['GME', 'AMC']",0

As most knows well in [***“There Is No Way, This Doesn’t End Badly,”***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/there-is-no-way-this-bull-market-doesnt-end-very-badly/) virtually every measure of fundamental analysis suggests the markets are very expensive. 

Let's dig in 

 *10-year forward returns are below zero historically when the price-to-sales ratio is at 2x. There has never been a previous period with the ratio climbing to near 3x.”* 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mok55matq8171.png?width=923&format=png&auto=webp&s=373aed0c5936f724473ccc367778191d6ca08b70

 Whether it is Market Capitalization to GDP, CAPE, Tobin’s Q, or Price-to-Sales, the problem with all valuation measures is they are **horrible market-timing indicators.** As shown in the chart below, **if you had gone to cash when the S&P first crossed into** ***“expensive”*** **territory greater than 23x CAPE, you would have missed most of the current bull market cycle.**  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rw9b4ppwq8171.png?width=937&format=png&auto=webp&s=18a0f6b96a4b0b26d9b136099df08d46cdfcb32b

 

Being doggedly attached to valuations and fundamentals can prove just as dangerous to long-term returns as getting caught in a bear market. **While a bear market does indeed destroy capital, not participating in a bull market has an equal impact on ending results.** 

An excellent example of the problem, shown below, with purely using fundamentals to manage a portfolio is the performance chart between *“momentum”* and *“value”* since 2009.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gunafgc0r8171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89d412aec69578bff108852fb42bf9a43594f99

 

Of course, this is the direct result of sustained ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy) and successive rounds of monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve.

Conclusion :

 **However, as is the case with every bull market, a strongly advancing market covers up the many investing mistakes investors make. It is the ensuing bear market that reveals them in the most brutal and unforgiving of outcomes.**  

 

**You can not successfully** ***“time the market.”*** Trying to be *“all in or out”* of every twist and turn of the market is impossible. **However, that doesn’t mean you must be passive and let it all wash all over you.**

There is a clear advantage to providing risk management to portfolios over time. **The problem is that most individuals cannot manage their own money because of** ***“short-termism.”*** *(As shown by shrinking holding periods)*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7vtl8r3kr8171.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f8d2248e179a7bd00d11dd3cd885c459bae51fe

 **Of course, with the media and Wall Street pushing the** ***“you are missing it”*** **mantra as the market rises, can you blame the average investor** ***“panic”*** **buying market tops and selling market bottoms?** 

&#x200B;

 I do understand there is a significant risk. [***If Jack Bogle is correct***](http://www.businessinsider.com/jack-bogle-warns-of-two-50-percent-market-declines-in-next-10-years-2013-4)***,*** *things* could be very disappointing. Or, as Seth Klarman from Baupost Capital once stated:

>***“Can we say when it will end? No. Can we say that it will end? Yes. And when it ends and the trend reverses, here is what we can say for sure. Few will be ready. Few will be prepared.”***

 

We saw much of the same mainstream analysis at the peak of the markets in 1999 and again in 2007. New valuation metrics, IPO’s of negligible companies, valuation dismissals as *“this time was different,”* and a building exuberance were common themes. **Unfortunately, the outcomes were always the same.** 

Our goal is to prepared.

You don't know if hes betting on them to move further or he's already out of the position. If you're trying to track him, at least do it right.",nk4o22,[],1
1202,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"The year was 2019.  I was convinced that in two years at the latest we'd all be eating cockroaches.  They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,[],0
1205,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn’t brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD’s Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> “While all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we’re risking is just different stovepipes,” Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. “**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**” 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM’s Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

Q1 EPS of ($0.48), in-line with the analyst estimate of ($0.48

By end of the year, # of markets will be doubled from last year

For the second quarter of 2021, revenue is expected to be between **$1.025 billion and $1.075 billion,** which represents **41% sequential growth over 1Q21** at the midpoint of the expected range. Adjusted EBITDA1  is expected to be between ($5) million and $5 million, which represents breakeven margin at the midpoint of the expected range

AND, Opendoor has about $**2 billion in cash.** If you follow the industry, you know that M&A is a real winner which will give them to expand even faster to additional markets.

I can't really think of many stocks that are better than Opendoor. Lots of potential here and it's at the price it jumped to on DA. It is more than 50%+ off of its highs and I think it represents a great buying opportunity as of right now.

I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again!

Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

1215,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,[],1
1217,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"The point is that senior employees of public companies are required to make their transactions public. It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I’ve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

Overall, the stock itself is undervalued given the market cap vs revenue with the projected growth rate over the next 3 years. Also, they just figured out a way to work around google's new algo which means business will continue to flow

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

Last week I sold calls for the first time and I decided to go all in. I had about $2,780 invested in QYLD which gave me about $343 a year and $28.6 a month. I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

1239,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"Compass is trading at a market cap that is on the high end of their projected revenue this year. This indicates some good room to move upward. The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don’t think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

1241,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I’m primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn’t necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can’t necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what’s to come. So, let’s take a look at PENN’s growth. 

In 2015 Penn’s revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN’s revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN’s debt to asset ratio of 80% isn’t terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN’s partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

What people aren't realizing is that RSUs converted today and all insiders automatically had a portion of their RSUs sold in order to cover the taxes.

1246,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"**tl;dr: PLUG has rallied on relief from the completion of its restatement, but accounting red flags remain -- and the economics are as bad as ever.**

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,['AAPL'],0
1251,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"Feel free to rag on me.  I am not an economist.  I just like trying to sound like I'm smart.  That's S-mart, baby.  


Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.  There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".  The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.  Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.  In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.  In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.    


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.  While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?  Good question.  I don't know yet.  Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.  Another good question.  I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?  The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.  They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.  This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.  *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**    


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.  And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?  I don't know, but here's a scary graph.  So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.  Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.  Not significantly.  After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.  So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.  Doesn't seem like much.  But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.  I went down another rabbit hole.  1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?  The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.  Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.  Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).  It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.  After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.  And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.  When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?  A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.  But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.  

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.  Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.  

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).  The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.  Tomorrow is Richmond.  Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.  But it's on a holiday weekend.  So responses should be muted.  If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.  If good, fuck it, why not?

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME –  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.  These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,"['GME', 'AMC']",0

As most knows well in [***“There Is No Way, This Doesn’t End Badly,”***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/there-is-no-way-this-bull-market-doesnt-end-very-badly/) virtually every measure of fundamental analysis suggests the markets are very expensive. 

Let's dig in 

 *10-year forward returns are below zero historically when the price-to-sales ratio is at 2x. There has never been a previous period with the ratio climbing to near 3x.”* 

&#x200B;

 Whether it is Market Capitalization to GDP, CAPE, Tobin’s Q, or Price-to-Sales, the problem with all valuation measures is they are **horrible market-timing indicators.** As shown in the chart below, **if you had gone to cash when the S&P first crossed into** ***“expensive”*** **territory greater than 23x CAPE, you would have missed most of the current bull market cycle.**

Being doggedly attached to valuations and fundamentals can prove just as dangerous to long-term returns as getting caught in a bear market. **While a bear market does indeed destroy capital, not participating in a bull market has an equal impact on ending results.** 

An excellent example of the problem, shown below, with purely using fundamentals to manage a portfolio is the performance chart between *“momentum”* and *“value”* since 2009.

Of course, this is the direct result of sustained ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy) and successive rounds of monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve.

Conclusion :

 **However, as is the case with every bull market, a strongly advancing market covers up the many investing mistakes investors make. It is the ensuing bear market that reveals them in the most brutal and unforgiving of outcomes.**  

 

**You can not successfully** ***“time the market.”*** Trying to be *“all in or out”* of every twist and turn of the market is impossible. **However, that doesn’t mean you must be passive and let it all wash all over you.**

There is a clear advantage to providing risk management to portfolios over time. **The problem is that most individuals cannot manage their own money because of** ***“short-termism.”*** *(As shown by shrinking holding periods)*

 **Of course, with the media and Wall Street pushing the** ***“you are missing it”*** **mantra as the market rises, can you blame the average investor** ***“panic”*** **buying market tops and selling market bottoms?** 

&#x200B;

 I do understand there is a significant risk. [***If Jack Bogle is correct***](http://www.businessinsider.com/jack-bogle-warns-of-two-50-percent-market-declines-in-next-10-years-2013-4)***,*** *things* could be very disappointing. Or, as Seth Klarman from Baupost Capital once stated:

>***“Can we say when it will end? No. Can we say that it will end? Yes. And when it ends and the trend reverses, here is what we can say for sure. Few will be ready. Few will be prepared.”***

 

We saw much of the same mainstream analysis at the peak of the markets in 1999 and again in 2007. New valuation metrics, IPO’s of negligible companies, valuation dismissals as *“this time was different,”* and a building exuberance were common themes. **Unfortunately, the outcomes were always the same.** 

Our goal is to prepared.

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let’s be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) – i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

”Money printer go brrr” was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn’t announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed’s explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

1463,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"Value investing and long term holding might not be synonimum with wallstreetbets, but I don't care, because I want to get this stock as much attention as I can now that I hold it.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Don't think I need to say anything here. It's pretty obvious that there could be a very sharp rebound from the trendline soon enough

Advice: don't play this short term or you'll get bruned, markets can stay irrational for a long time. Just hold shares, maybe with 2:1 leverage if you are brave. If you need to play options, go LEAPS for this one and it might make you a lot of money. Also: diverisify like an adult, China or the world could still implode tomorrow.",njyajv,[],1

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

2001,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn’t brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD’s Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> “While all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we’re risking is just different stovepipes,” Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. “**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**” 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM’s Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

2011,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,[],1
2013,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"The point is that senior employees of public companies are required to make their transactions public. It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I’ve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

**So, top 5 companies by insider buying activity:**

2014,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"Stock split of TTD is coming soon. With the drop of prices recently, it seems like a good time to get in as the hype will drive prices up prior to the split and also the lower prices will increase demand after the split. 

Overall, the stock itself is undervalued given the market cap vs revenue with the projected growth rate over the next 3 years. Also, they just figured out a way to work around google's new algo which means business will continue to flow

&#x200B;

I just got in today, though I have been wanting to get in for the last week (had to clear some other positions) and looks like I lost about 10% potential gains (I shouldnt have even thought about my other shitty positions!). I am looking at at least 20% more gains over the next 3 months

2017,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets," 

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

2023,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"The Gates Foundation sold Apple, which I find a bit weird, and they sold Twitter which I agree with. They bought a bunch of stock in a company called Coupang Inc (CPNG) - a South Korean company that focuses on e-commerce - home goods, food, etc. - looks a lot like Walmart in the U.S. 
Selling their Apple stock which has a .22 cent quarterly dividend (which paid the Foundation over $220,000 per quarter) to buy CPNG that has NO dividend at all sends off all kinds of BUY alarms in my book. CPNG closed up $2.49 today - $40.50 a share. I picked up shares early today. Keep your eyes on this one!",nk7n4k,['AAPL'],0
2025,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"I've decided to do away for the time being with dividend investing and decided to go all in on the Wheel strategy with BNGO. Last week I sold calls for the first time and I decided to go all in. I had about $2,780 invested in QYLD which gave me about $343 a year and $28.6 a month. I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term. 

Hopefully I can update in a month on the status and outcome of my current play. All I can say is that it literally can't go tits up.",nk85dk,[],0

2035,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"Compass is trading at a market cap that is on the high end of their projected revenue this year. This indicates some good room to move upward. The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don’t think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

2037,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I’m primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn’t necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can’t necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what’s to come. So, let’s take a look at PENN’s growth. 

In 2015 Penn’s revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN’s revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN’s debt to asset ratio of 80% isn’t terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN’s partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

What people aren't realizing is that RSUs converted today and all insiders automatically had a portion of their RSUs sold in order to cover the taxes.

2042,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"**tl;dr: PLUG has rallied on relief from the completion of its restatement, but accounting red flags remain -- and the economics are as bad as ever.**

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,['AAPL'],0
2047,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"Feel free to rag on me.  I am not an economist.  I just like trying to sound like I'm smart.  That's S-mart, baby.  


Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.  There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".  The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.  Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.  In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.  In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.    


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.  While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?  Good question.  I don't know yet.  Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.  Another good question.  I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?  The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.  They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.  This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.  *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**    


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.  And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?  I don't know, but here's a scary graph.  So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.  Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.  Not significantly.  After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.  So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.  Doesn't seem like much.  But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.  I went down another rabbit hole.  1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?  The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.  Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.  Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).  It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.  After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.  And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.  When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?  A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.  But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.  

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.  Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.

Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.  But it's on a holiday weekend.  So responses should be muted.  If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.  If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME –  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.  These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,"['GME', 'AMC']",0

As most knows well in [***“There Is No Way, This Doesn’t End Badly,”***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/there-is-no-way-this-bull-market-doesnt-end-very-badly/) virtually every measure of fundamental analysis suggests the markets are very expensive. 

Let's dig in 

 *10-year forward returns are below zero historically when the price-to-sales ratio is at 2x. There has never been a previous period with the ratio climbing to near 3x.”* 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mok55matq8171.png?width=923&format=png&auto=webp&s=373aed0c5936f724473ccc367778191d6ca08b70

 Whether it is Market Capitalization to GDP, CAPE, Tobin’s Q, or Price-to-Sales, the problem with all valuation measures is they are **horrible market-timing indicators.** As shown in the chart below, **if you had gone to cash when the S&P first crossed into** ***“expensive”*** **territory greater than 23x CAPE, you would have missed most of the current bull market cycle.**  

&#x200B;

Being doggedly attached to valuations and fundamentals can prove just as dangerous to long-term returns as getting caught in a bear market. **While a bear market does indeed destroy capital, not participating in a bull market has an equal impact on ending results.** 

An excellent example of the problem, shown below, with purely using fundamentals to manage a portfolio is the performance chart between *“momentum”* and *“value”* since 2009.

&#x200B;

Of course, this is the direct result of sustained ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy) and successive rounds of monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve.

Conclusion :

 **However, as is the case with every bull market, a strongly advancing market covers up the many investing mistakes investors make. It is the ensuing bear market that reveals them in the most brutal and unforgiving of outcomes.**  

 

**You can not successfully** ***“time the market.”*** Trying to be *“all in or out”* of every twist and turn of the market is impossible. **However, that doesn’t mean you must be passive and let it all wash all over you.**

There is a clear advantage to providing risk management to portfolios over time. **The problem is that most individuals cannot manage their own money because of** ***“short-termism.”*** *(As shown by shrinking holding periods)*

 **Of course, with the media and Wall Street pushing the** ***“you are missing it”*** **mantra as the market rises, can you blame the average investor** ***“panic”*** **buying market tops and selling market bottoms?** 

&#x200B;

 I do understand there is a significant risk. [***If Jack Bogle is correct***](http://www.businessinsider.com/jack-bogle-warns-of-two-50-percent-market-declines-in-next-10-years-2013-4)***,*** *things* could be very disappointing. Or, as Seth Klarman from Baupost Capital once stated:

>***“Can we say when it will end? No. Can we say that it will end? Yes. And when it ends and the trend reverses, here is what we can say for sure. Few will be ready. Few will be prepared.”***

 

We saw much of the same mainstream analysis at the peak of the markets in 1999 and again in 2007.

2801,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"Postmates completely changed their app, deleted thousands upon thousands of restaurants from their customer's menus and serial-customers (folks who order 2-3+ times a week) have been cut off from being able to order for tens-hundreds of thousands of people.  Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

2811,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"The year was 2019.  I was convinced that in two years at the latest we'd all be eating cockroaches.  They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

2814,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn’t brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD’s Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> “While all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we’re risking is just different stovepipes,” Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. “**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**” 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM’s Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

2824,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,[],1
2826,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"The point is that senior employees of public companies are required to make their transactions public. It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees.

Overall, the stock itself is undervalued given the market cap vs revenue with the projected growth rate over the next 3 years. Also, they just figured out a way to work around google's new algo which means business will continue to flow

I just got in today, though I have been wanting to get in for the last week (had to clear some other positions) and looks like I lost about 10% potential gains (I shouldnt have even thought about my other shitty positions!). I am looking at at least 20% more gains over the next 3 months

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

Last week I sold calls for the first time and I decided to go all in. I had about $2,780 invested in QYLD which gave me about $343 a year and $28.6 a month. I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

2848,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"Compass is trading at a market cap that is on the high end of their projected revenue this year. This indicates some good room to move upward. The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don’t think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

2850,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I’m primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn’t necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can’t necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what’s to come. So, let’s take a look at PENN’s growth. 

In 2015 Penn’s revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN’s revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN’s debt to asset ratio of 80% isn’t terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN’s partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

2855,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"**tl;dr: PLUG has rallied on relief from the completion of its restatement, but accounting red flags remain -- and the economics are as bad as ever.**

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,['AAPL'],0
2860,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"Feel free to rag on me.  I am not an economist.  I just like trying to sound like I'm smart.  That's S-mart, baby.  


Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.  There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".  The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.  Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.  In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.  In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.    


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.  While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?  Good question.  I don't know yet.  Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.  Another good question.  I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?  The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.  They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.  This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.  *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**    


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.  And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?  I don't know, but here's a scary graph.  So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.  Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.  Not significantly.  After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.  So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.  Doesn't seem like much.  But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.  I went down another rabbit hole.  1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?  The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.  Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.  Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).  It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.  After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.  And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.  When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?  A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.  But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.  

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.  Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.  

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).  The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.  Tomorrow is Richmond.  Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.  But it's on a holiday weekend.  So responses should be muted.  If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.  If good, fuck it, why not?

# Does SelfWealth impose any restrictions on stocks such as GameStop (GME)?

* 25 days ago

&#x200B;

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME –  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.  These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,"['GME', 'AMC']",0

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.

That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

3186,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn’t brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD’s Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> “While all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we’re risking is just different stovepipes,” Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. “**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**” 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM’s Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

Q1 EPS of ($0.48), in-line with the analyst estimate of ($0.48

By end of the year, # of markets will be doubled from last year

For the second quarter of 2021, revenue is expected to be between **$1.025 billion and $1.075 billion,** which represents **41% sequential growth over 1Q21** at the midpoint of the expected range. Adjusted EBITDA1  is expected to be between ($5) million and $5 million, which represents breakeven margin at the midpoint of the expected range

AND, Opendoor has about $**2 billion in cash.** If you follow the industry, you know that M&A is a real winner which will give them to expand even faster to additional markets.

I can't really think of many stocks that are better than Opendoor. Lots of potential here and it's at the price it jumped to on DA. It is more than 50%+ off of its highs and I think it represents a great buying opportunity as of right now.

Lordstown Motors options imply 22.5% move in share price post-earnings (TheFlyOnTheWall)

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

3196,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,[],1
3198,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"The point is that senior employees of public companies are required to make their transactions public. It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I’ve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

3202,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets," 

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Last week I sold calls for the first time and I decided to go all in. I had about $2,780 invested in QYLD which gave me about $343 a year and $28.6 a month. I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

3220,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"Compass is trading at a market cap that is on the high end of their projected revenue this year. This indicates some good room to move upward. The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don’t think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

3222,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I’m primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn’t necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can’t necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what’s to come. So, let’s take a look at PENN’s growth. 

In 2015 Penn’s revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN’s revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN’s debt to asset ratio of 80% isn’t terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN’s partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

What people aren't realizing is that RSUs converted today and all insiders automatically had a portion of their RSUs sold in order to cover the taxes. They was an automated event applied equally across the entire company including the c-suite and there was no option to prevent the sale and pay in cash.

3227,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"**tl;dr: PLUG has rallied on relief from the completion of its restatement, but accounting red flags remain -- and the economics are as bad as ever.**

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,['AAPL'],0
3232,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"Feel free to rag on me.  I am not an economist.  I just like trying to sound like I'm smart.  That's S-mart, baby.  


Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.  There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".  The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.  Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.  In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.  In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.    


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.  While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?  Good question.  I don't know yet.  Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.  Another good question.  I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?  The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.  They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.  This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.  *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**    


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.  And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?  I don't know, but here's a scary graph.  So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.  Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.  Not significantly.  After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.  So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.  Doesn't seem like much.  But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.  I went down another rabbit hole.  1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?  The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.  Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.  Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).  It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.  After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.  And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.  When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?  A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.  But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.  

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.  Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.  But it's on a holiday weekend.  So responses should be muted.  If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.  If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME –  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.  These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,"['GME', 'AMC']",0

3867,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"Postmates completely changed their app, deleted thousands upon thousands of restaurants from their customer's menus and serial-customers (folks who order 2-3+ times a week) have been cut off from being able to order for tens-hundreds of thousands of people.  Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

3877,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"The year was 2019.  I was convinced that in two years at the latest we'd all be eating cockroaches.  They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

3880,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn’t brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD’s Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> “While all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we’re risking is just different stovepipes,” Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. “**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**” 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM’s Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

3890,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,[],1
3892,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"The point is that senior employees of public companies are required to make their transactions public. It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I’ve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

3893,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"Stock split of TTD is coming soon. With the drop of prices recently, it seems like a good time to get in as the hype will drive prices up prior to the split and also the lower prices will increase demand after the split. 

Overall, the stock itself is undervalued given the market cap vs revenue with the projected growth rate over the next 3 years. Also, they just figured out a way to work around google's new algo which means business will continue to flow

I just got in today, though I have been wanting to get in for the last week (had to clear some other positions) and looks like I lost about 10% potential gains (I shouldnt have even thought about my other shitty positions!). I am looking at at least 20% more gains over the next 3 months

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

3902,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"The Gates Foundation sold Apple, which I find a bit weird, and they sold Twitter which I agree with. They bought a bunch of stock in a company called Coupang Inc (CPNG) - a South Korean company that focuses on e-commerce - home goods, food, etc. - looks a lot like Walmart in the U.S. 
Selling their Apple stock which has a .22 cent quarterly dividend (which paid the Foundation over $220,000 per quarter) to buy CPNG that has NO dividend at all sends off all kinds of BUY alarms in my book. CPNG closed up $2.49 today - $40.50 a share. I picked up shares early today. Keep your eyes on this one!",nk7n4k,['AAPL'],0
3904,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"I've decided to do away for the time being with dividend investing and decided to go all in on the Wheel strategy with BNGO. Last week I sold calls for the first time and I decided to go all in. I had about $2,780 invested in QYLD which gave me about $343 a year and $28.6 a month. I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term. 

Hopefully I can update in a month on the status and outcome of my current play. All I can say is that it literally can't go tits up.",nk85dk,[],0

3914,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"Compass is trading at a market cap that is on the high end of their projected revenue this year. This indicates some good room to move upward. The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don’t think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play. Their revenue growth over the next few years should drive it up nicely.",nkdxwl,[],1
3916,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I’m primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn’t necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can’t necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what’s to come. So, let’s take a look at PENN’s growth. 

In 2015 Penn’s revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN’s revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN’s debt to asset ratio of 80% isn’t terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN’s partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

What people aren't realizing is that RSUs converted today and all insiders automatically had a portion of their RSUs sold in order to cover the taxes.

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,['AAPL'],0
3925,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"Feel free to rag on me.  I am not an economist.  I just like trying to sound like I'm smart.  That's S-mart, baby.  


Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.  There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".  The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.  Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.  In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.  In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.    


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.  While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?  Good question.  I don't know yet.  Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.  Another good question.  I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?  The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.  They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.  This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.  *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**    


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.  And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?  I don't know, but here's a scary graph.  So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.  Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.  Not significantly.  After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.  So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.  Doesn't seem like much.  But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.  I went down another rabbit hole.  1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?  The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.  Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.  Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).  It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.  After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.  And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.  When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?  A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.  But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.  

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.  Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.  

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).  The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.  Tomorrow is Richmond.  Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.  But it's on a holiday weekend.  So responses should be muted.  If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.  If good, fuck it, why not?

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME –  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.  These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,"['GME', 'AMC']",0

3943,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"Why is there not much chatter around GRAMF? Everything I read about this company indicates its a potential multibagger.

My analysis:

GRAMF is a cannabis holding company focusing on recreational cannabis products. Currently it consists of two lines: Caliva, a delivery-based recreational cannabis company, and Monogram, a luxury cannabis brand. 

Currently GRAMF trades at $6.00 and 96mio shares outstanding for a market cap of $575m.

GRAMFs market cap of $575m is tiny compared to most of the well-known cannabis stocks which are all 1bio+. It has huge room for upside growth.

GRAMF currently holds close to $300m just in cash. Compared to its $575m market cap, this implies GRAMF has a floor price of  $3.26 JUST based on cash alone!

MARKET SHARE

The cannabis market is currently particularly fragmented without any clear brand winner. For example, in california the top 10 cannabis brands only make up 30% total sales in the region. GRAMF has a good chance to emerge as a leader in this field for two reasons.

1. Star Power: GRAMF is partnered with Jay-Z and his company Roc Nation (With artists like Rihanna, Meek Mill, Alicia Keys, et al). This is a huge outlet for cheap mass marketing, celebrity endorsements, and promotion. This will cement GRAMF as a brand in consumers’ minds.

2. M&A: GRAMF management indicates it plans to use its huge cash war chest to aggressively acquire competitors. These M&A deals will consolidate its foothold in the cannabis field and M&A news will also help spike GRAMF share price.

GROWTH

Recreational cannabis was just legalized in march 2021 in NY. This is a huge untapped market which GRAMF has indicated is a focus of expansion. With Jay-Z and his east coast reputation at the helm, GRAMF has a huge chance to become a brand name in the region. 

Federal legalization in 2021/2022 is a also potential catalyst for the cannabis sector as a whole. Cannabis legislation by all indications looks to be favorable under the current Biden administration and has bipartisan support. GRAMF is currently only traded OTC because current regulations do not allow cannabis stocks to be listed on exchanges. Once regulation reform comes and GRAMF gets listed, this will drive share prices up.

GRAMF has come off from its initial price of ~$11 when it first deSPAC’ed to around $6 currently due to weak Q1 revenues and margins and its relative quietness currently. Its now trading quite cheaply compared to other cannabis stocks out there, and if it can post better Q2 numbers, make a splash in M&A, and builds up its general brand recognition, expect the share price to skyrocket.",nkpl9a,[],1

4117,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"Postmates completely changed their app, deleted thousands upon thousands of restaurants from their customer's menus and serial-customers (folks who order 2-3+ times a week) have been cut off from being able to order for tens-hundreds of thousands of people.  Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

4127,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"The year was 2019.  I was convinced that in two years at the latest we'd all be eating cockroaches.  They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,[],0
4130,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn’t brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD’s Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> “While all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we’re risking is just different stovepipes,” Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. “**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**” 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM’s Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

4140,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,[],1

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

4154,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"I've decided to do away for the time being with dividend investing and decided to go all in on the Wheel strategy with BNGO. Last week I sold calls for the first time and I decided to go all in. I had about $2,780 invested in QYLD which gave me about $343 a year and $28.6 a month. I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

4164,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"Compass is trading at a market cap that is on the high end of their projected revenue this year. This indicates some good room to move upward. The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don’t think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play.

4166,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"I want to preface this by saying that I’m primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn’t necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can’t necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what’s to come. So, let’s take a look at PENN’s growth. 

In 2015 Penn’s revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN’s revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN’s debt to asset ratio of 80% isn’t terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN’s partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

What people aren't realizing is that RSUs converted today and all insiders automatically had a portion of their RSUs sold in order to cover the taxes.

4171,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"**tl;dr: PLUG has rallied on relief from the completion of its restatement, but accounting red flags remain -- and the economics are as bad as ever.**

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.",nkh20n,['AAPL'],0
4175,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"Feel free to rag on me.  I am not an economist.  I just like trying to sound like I'm smart.  That's S-mart, baby.  


Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.  There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".  The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.  Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.  In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.  In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.    


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.  While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?  Good question.  I don't know yet.  Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.  Another good question.  I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?  The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.  They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.  This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.  *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**    


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.  And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?  I don't know, but here's a scary graph.  So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.  Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.  Not significantly.  After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.  So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.  Doesn't seem like much.  But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.  I went down another rabbit hole.  1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?  The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.  Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.  Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).  It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.  After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.  And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.  When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?  A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.  But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.  

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.  Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.  

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).  The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.  Tomorrow is Richmond.  Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.  But it's on a holiday weekend.  So responses should be muted.  If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.  If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

# Does SelfWealth impose any restrictions on stocks such as GameStop (GME)?

* 25 days ago
* Updated

&#x200B;

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME –  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.  These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",nkk4c1,"['GME', 'AMC']",0

On the Barkbox conference call last week, a June 1st date was mentioned. Bark Stockholders received Authorization form for signature last week and the stockholder vote for approval of the merger is May 28th. **BARK**, the company behind [**BarkBox**](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=2920401-1&h=3831340788&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barkbox.com%2F&a=BarkBox), today announced that its board of directors has appointed **Manish Joneja**, most recently a leader at Amazon focused on global exports, expansion and operations, to succeed BARK co-founder **Matt Meeker** as the CEO, effective immediately.

4193,2021-05-25,wallstreetbets,"Why is there not much chatter around GRAMF? Everything I read about this company indicates its a potential multibagger.

My analysis:

GRAMF is a cannabis holding company focusing on recreational cannabis products. Currently it consists of two lines: Caliva, a delivery-based recreational cannabis company, and Monogram, a luxury cannabis brand. 

Currently GRAMF trades at $6.00 and 96mio shares outstanding for a market cap of $575m.

GRAMFs market cap of $575m is tiny compared to most of the well-known cannabis stocks which are all 1bio+. It has huge room for upside growth.

GRAMF currently holds close to $300m just in cash. Compared to its $575m market cap, this implies GRAMF has a floor price of  $3.26 JUST based on cash alone!

MARKET SHARE

The cannabis market is currently particularly fragmented without any clear brand winner. For example, in california the top 10 cannabis brands only make up 30% total sales in the region. GRAMF has a good chance to emerge as a leader in this field for two reasons.

1. Star Power: GRAMF is partnered with Jay-Z and his company Roc Nation (With artists like Rihanna, Meek Mill, Alicia Keys, et al). This is a huge outlet for cheap mass marketing, celebrity endorsements, and promotion. This will cement GRAMF as a brand in consumers’ minds.

2. M&A: GRAMF management indicates it plans to use its huge cash war chest to aggressively acquire competitors. These M&A deals will consolidate its foothold in the cannabis field and M&A news will also help spike GRAMF share price.

GROWTH

Recreational cannabis was just legalized in march 2021 in NY. This is a huge untapped market which GRAMF has indicated is a focus of expansion. With Jay-Z and his east coast reputation at the helm, GRAMF has a huge chance to become a brand name in the region. 

Federal legalization in 2021/2022 is a also potential catalyst for the cannabis sector as a whole. Cannabis legislation by all indications looks to be favorable under the current Biden administration and has bipartisan support. GRAMF is currently only traded OTC because current regulations do not allow cannabis stocks to be listed on exchanges. Once regulation reform comes and GRAMF gets listed, this will drive share prices up.

GRAMF has come off from its initial price of ~$11 when it first deSPAC’ed to around $6 currently due to weak Q1 revenues and margins and its relative quietness currently. Its now trading quite cheaply compared to other cannabis stocks out there, and if it can post better Q2 numbers, make a splash in M&A, and builds up its general brand recognition, expect the share price to skyrocket.",nkpl9a,[],1
