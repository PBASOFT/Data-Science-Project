If you buy deep ITM options, you get better leverage on your money and have less exposure. There is obviously less upside if the stock moons (compared to OTM options), but 40 $8 calls expiring in Dec were trading around $7.50 when you bought those shares, which would have cost you \~30k. If AMC drops below $8, you lose all intrinsic value. However your downside is capped at 30k. With the shares, you put up front an additional 30k in capital, get the same sort of profit profile, and if AMC drops below $8, you lose more than 30k.

Call is the type of option, meaning that the purchaser has the right (but not obligation) to purchase shares at $185, rather than $215.40.   If the stock price is at $185, OP is ‚Äúat the money‚Äù, anything over is ‚Äúin the money‚Äù, but an investor will only exercise if it‚Äôs in their best interest. 

2) No, OP doesn‚Äôt have to buy the contracts at the strike price. The downside is that OP is paying a fee for the writing of the option, which is the option premium price. Meaning, each share has a dollar amount attached to it (say, $2 per share) that the buyer needs to pay to the seller in order to reserve this right to purchase the shares at the strike price. This is why people who buy options only exercise when the market price is in the money rather than at the money: because in order to make a profit you need to also factor in the price you‚Äôre paying for the option premium ON TOP OF the price of the stock. Also, it‚Äôs not 100 contracts, it‚Äôs actually 282 contracts of 100 shares PER CONTRACT.",[],0

So an increase in premium for a certain percentage OTM only reflects an increase in uncertainty of the future movement of the underlying asset.

Keep in mind call-put parity. The extrinsic value of an ITM call is essentially equal to that of the extrinsic value of the OTM out at the same strike(its whole value). Meaning, if the extrinsic value of the OTM puts are increased, bearish, that means the extrinsic value of the ITM calls are also equally increasing, bullish.

This type of complaint is not new. I'd say we make the best of what we have and move forward. The GME/AMC hype will also pass, but as long as there is money to be made, people will continue. Why not? Remember the Hertz crowd? Exactly. 

Tesla died down when a lot of retards were wiped out after battery day and Elon stopped commenting here. AMC has always been somewhat suppressed, but GME was really supressed when the thread was removed and people were invited to leave. That also wiped hundreds of thousands of daily active users and polarized further the sub.

Only problem is that in the run up to earnings, IV will be going up due to uncertainty, so the price of the puts will be going up too. 

So even if you're correct and the earnings are garbage and the stock drops, IV will tank too because the uncertainty is resolved, so the price of the puts will be negatively impacted because of vega.

Yes, it‚Äôs the exact opposite with puts, in fact puts are the reason why GME has exploded in the first place. The hedge funds performed a strategy thats called a ‚Äúnaked call‚Äù, meaning they sold call options to buyers and made money off the premiums (for every call option there is a buyer and a seller, and the amount that the ‚Äúwinner‚Äù makes directly correlates with the amount the ‚Äúloser‚Äù loses). The difference here though, is that they don‚Äôt actually own the stocks that they are selling, so if the price goes up, the buyers of these call options can do what‚Äôs called a ‚Äúmargin call‚Äù to get their shares, which forces the writer of the option (the hedge funds) to purchase the stocks in order to fulfill the contracts. This puts buying pressure on the stock which raises the price, putting more options in the money and thus creating a positive feedback loop called the ‚Äúgamma squeeze‚Äù.",['GME'],1

Before Gamestop you can find articles such as linked at the bottom here that point out that hedge funds overall don't do very well. In other words if they have all this special access that gives them a leg up to beat the market, it is not working very well.

Oh, as to shorting a stock over 100%, it is perfectly legal, you just don't understand how shorting works. It is just crazy risky as it sets up a short squeeze because it makes it easier for someone to buy over enough of the float that covering becomes very difficult.

AMC and some companies are like a lemonade stand that costs $25/yr to run but only sells $5 worth of lemonade per year, and for some reason you the neighbor is willing to buy it for $35.

Did I give up on my dreams? No. I bet a majority of architecture students just have the dream of designing their own home. So I got a degree in CompSci (well, the easier one, which was Computational Informatics) and busted my ass and taught myself employable languages so I could graduate and start a high earning career 


Now, I'm not saying student loans are perfect the way they are, quite the contrary. Realistically what should happen, is fixed interest rates (c'mon, no company should be making 10% off student loans), not a full on forgiveness.

Lo que importa es conseguir entrar en un strike que puede caber alguna o varias veces en la diferencia entre el precio actual y un precio objetivo a un plazo determinado.

üçå Worth $30

üôä thinks üçå is going to be more expensive soon and buys a call option from üçå merchant for $25 (the price of the contract, called 'premium'), which allows üôä to buy 100 üçås at a later date for $30 dollars each, but he doesn't have to buy the bananas if he doesn't want to.

Scenario 1:

Volcano erupts, üçåüéÑ wiped out, üçå Price goes üöÄüåô and üôä decides to exercise his option to buy 100 üçå for $30 dollars each, and then sells them for $100 each making 70*100-25 ($6975 for you retards who can't math).

Scenario 2:

Volcano is üìÑüëê bitch and doesn't explode. üçå price stays the same. üôä Decides the option is not worth calling and is out of the 25 bucks he gave to üçå merchant.


Puts:

üçå Worth $30

üôä thinks üçå is going to be cheaper soon and buys a put option for $25 (the price of the contract, called 'premium'), which allows üôä to sell 100 üçås at a later date for $30 dollars each, but he doesn't have to sell the bananas if he doesn't want to.

Scenario 1:

Volcano erupts, üçåüéÑ wiped out, üçå Price goes üöÄüåô and üôä can't exercise his put option so it expires worthless. He loses the $25 bucks he paid for premium. 

Scenario 2:

üçåüéÑ are planted on a super fertile soil and provide absolutely insane amount of üçås.  üçå price tanks to $10 and üôä can:

1) üôä already owns 100 üçås, and exercises his puts, thus selling 100 üçå for $30 bucks each even though the price is already down to $10. This is called a 'protective put'. üôä didn't make any profit, but he didn't lose anything either (except the $25 premium). This is good to hedge your investment in case it tanks.

2) üôä owns 0 üçås, but buys 100 üçås at $10 each. He then exercises his put option, and sells them for $30 each, making a nice profit (($30-$10) x 100 - $25 = $1975)",[],0

There is no ‚Äúpotentially infinite loss‚Äù unless you are really, really, (and I mean, really) retarded, such as shorting something like a 0.30 dollar Biotech penny stock and then it discover the cure for cancer or some shit like that. This actually happened when that guy Martin Schkreli bought a penny biotech on the verge of bankruptcy and went from 0.10 to like 8 dollars, but again, people who short that kind of stuff are waiting for a catastrophe to happen. 

I always, routinely short ‚Äúnormal‚Äù stocks because it‚Äôs actually much safer to be hedged (so I long X finance stock and short another Y finance stock). This way I‚Äôm market neutral and I don‚Äôt care if everything goes to shit, which actually reduces my risk. 

There‚Äôs also a thing called ‚Äústop losses‚Äù, which I know many of you here don‚Äôt even know what they are, but you always use stop losses when shorting, as easy as that. Many times my short has gone south (it‚Äôs a normal part of trading, even a 55% winrate is pretty decent for example) and I just take my loss. Unless there is an extreme squeeze event (such as Volkswagen or something crazy like that), you always get filled close to the SL price.

TLDR: you are pretty retarded if you think shorting automatically incurs on infinite losses, lmao.",[],1

Hey - **Yo GME freaks..** 

Aren't the diamond hands the SAME people who are playing the futures? - because the diamond handz  ARE covered, right? And that statistic of \*covered\* futures sure can not be read from the figures. So the new kidz are buying shares - bottom line - off the diamond handz, and the diamond hands are saying ""***do it do it there's an imminent squeeze***"".

Roblox for example targets a niche demographic and functions as essentially an interface and platform for people to make their own creations that can be run in instanced ways. No matter how innovative the ""game"" created on the platform, these ""games"" will always be constrained by the limits of the platform. As a result any ""game"" that becomes successful enough and is growing will depart the platform to become its own standalone title, for example unturned.

Thats the main issue here. Platforms such as Linden Lab's Second Life does and has everything Roblox has, while also doing far far more and has true persistence as an internet of virtual spaces in a true sense rather than instances of creations you load or join. Second Life also has a thriving creator economy and virtual real estate turning over thousands of dollars per day for creators. Second Life on top of this targets all demographics by being a web protocol rather than a platform for content. 

Despite all of this, Second Life remains neutral in its growth and even slightly negative in growth and while profitable sees little to no growth. 

So if competitors to Roblox are doing more than roblox and despite this are not seeing growth in value, how is roblox going to be different despite doing less and targeting an even smaller demographic?",[],0

""Doing research your own research"" has got to be near the top of the 2020-2021's ""shit uninformed people say"" list. 

Doing your own research SHOULD be a relatively respectable statement to make, but in reality what ""doing your own research"" typically entails is looking up someone else's research that is dumbed down and presented in a slightly entertaining way to give your brain a feeling of productivity and entertainment. The big picture of this is everyone is sourcing each other, using each others ideas, and feedback looping information and the use of that information.

WHICH WOULD BE FINE IF THIS SOMEONE WAS RIGHT.

But in almost every instance, they're not.

Few weeks ago when they talked about the dillution they were saying amc will not dillute it and all, then amc dilluted and they just changed the narrative to ""its all for the best we stronger than ever""

So basically amc is a cult without reason. The only legit reason they can provide is that post covid people will go to theaters ... It doesnt justify a climb in prices with the last year and the previous ones that were a downhill fall but with crazy support you can expect crazy reactions. I know its going down as a business model but i decided to ride along with the cultists.

It is expensive to make and hold stock of raw materials if you can‚Äôt sell them, it‚Äôs not free to use a warehouse or even guarantee that your materials aren‚Äôt ruined in storage. The cost of transportation increasing would not be because of an increase in wages, again several of those costs are associated with months of shutdown. The idea that rising wages causes supply of a good to decrease is not consistent with intertemporal models, especially in the long run. Additionally the wage increase has not been across the board for everyone in the economy. The supply chain disruption is in chips (leading to car price increases) that are primarily made in China and some other parts of Asia (I don‚Äôt believe they have had a significant wage increase, please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong not trying to be sarcastic I really don‚Äôt know). 

Please look at the median inflation not the average and then compare it to the price deflator. There is a reason economist have multiple tools to measure the relative price of things. The CPI is a great tool but it is not the end all be all and it has a tendency to overstate in its own way. (I know price deflator has its downfalls too). But comparing them will generally let you know if your off base when one has ‚Äúflashing lights‚Äù

If there were a wage increase as you hypothesized than inflation is negating that to where the wage increase is offset by the price of the goods and there is no real change only nominal. Compare the nominal wage increase data that you have to the nominal inflation rate and see what the real difference is and if you believe that number is extreme enough to classify as runaway inflation.

The last thing is this, inflation isn‚Äôt bad. Especially when macro growth has been centralized and over stated by gig economy workers since the last recession. We need inflation and have always had it, if we don‚Äôt it means we aren‚Äôt growing as an economy. It also makes it relatively cheaper to pay back personal debt, which is something that burdens almost everyone that had a ‚Äúwage increase‚Äù 

You also forgot to mention that whole wage increase was going on the central bank was buying bonds of companies at a rate and risk they never had before. I guess my main point is inflation is a tool to use but doesn‚Äôt control everything. There is a lot more going on than just inflation going up so the stock market moves. You gotta dig deeper

However I do not buy your premise at all. Catastrophes like pandemics and market corrections really don't affect the wealthiest peoples day to day lives, and at ticket prices anywhere from $200,000 to $400,000 for a couple hours experience who is Branson target audience?

If Travis Barker, Joe Rogan, Neil Degrasse Tyson, or Bill Ney the Science Guy want to go to fucking space; the tail end of a pandemic and a market correction are going to be totally irrelevant. The real limitation is Virgin's abilities to actually be able to do it, but once Branson goes the real limiting factor will be their turn around ability of how often they can do it, and mechanical repairs.

Also even if your point WAS valid, they ALREADY have 600 tickets sold and a huge waiting list. SO even if the pandemic worsens and a Q3 or Q4 market correction took place, they already have their first 600 passengers ready to go. Ideally their goal is 400 flights a year, and at the very start of the project that is obviously going to be much slower, turn around. So its not a stretch to assume that is 2 years of passengers already ready paid and agreed to go, decisions been made market forces or pandemics be damned.

I agree between now and the announcement of the Branson flight, their price will decrease gradually from where it is now. But the minute Branson's confirmed to fly, (Q4 I think) as long as their aren't any accidents this rocket will at minimum 3x and not come back for a long time.",[],0

https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424592/tesla-elon-musk-autopilot-dmv-fsd-exaggeration

He also pushed real hard for FSD Beta to be available widely and then had to walk it back.
Plus, just go look at youtube videos of people testing the FSD beta in suburban and urban areas, especially unprotected left turns where it always wants to wait during a gap and T-bone the next car or pull out directly in front of it...  not to mention the times it misunderstands speed limits or tries to drive where there is no road when it gets confused.

Elon is good at overstating shit and then hoping it plays out, but I think his luck there might be running out...  just look at how the Boring tunnel went from cool carts that zip around your car autonomously to an underwhelming and claustrophobic tunnel with trained taxi drivers.",[],0

Lmao you're proving my point for me. Watching a video on YouTube of someone's charts? Do you think this counts as research? Do you have a understanding of why certain chart patterns look a certain way to begin with? Like the actual underlying auction theory reasons? Have you read into how HFT's have changed the way patterns form in charts, such as option greeks and MM hedging obligations have changed the way patterns are seen on screen? 

Watching someone elses video without doing anything else appears to be your qualifier for ""not researching, but watching"" but your qualifier for turning that into ""researching"" is simply...looking at the charts yourself and checking in on a couple of articles?

Options contracts allow you to either sell or purchase 100 shares per contract of an equity at a particular strike price on or before the expiry date.
  
Owning a call contract allows you to purchase 100 shares of the underlying strike price.  
Writing (selling, net negative contract ownership) a call contract obligates you to sell 100 shares of the underlying at the strike price.  
  
Owning a put contract allows you to sell 100 shares of the underlying at the strike price.  
Writing (selling, net negative contract ownership) a put contract obligates you to purchase 100 shares of the underlying at the strike price.  
  
Purchasing a contract costs a premium per share. Writing a contract means someone else is paying you a premium per share for the contract you are writing.  
  
If a contract expires out of the money, then the contract has no value. The writer of the contract in this case profits the premium for which it was initially sold. The purchaser of the contract has a loss of the premium for which it was initially purchased.  
  
The current value of a contract is related to the statistical likelihood of the contract being ITM by expiry. The more unlikely, the cheaper the contract (e.g. a SPY $500 call that expires tomorrow when the current price of SPY is $420).  
  
When looking at options contracts, your primary factors in price changes are Theta (change in value over time), Delta (change in value by price), and Vega (change in value by volatility).  
  
For purchased calls, Theta is negative (you lose money as time passes because there is less time for the stock to go ITM/further ITM), Delta is positive (as the price of the underlying increases, the contract value increases by the Delta amount), and Vega is positive (as the measure of volatility of the stock increases, the contract value increases by the Vega amount). These values are not static and change over time (which is represented by the other greek values).  
  
You can generate profit off of options without the underlying ever going ITM. For instance, you have likely seen posts of people profiting off of GME with $800 strike calls, even though GME has to date never closed above $500. This is because both the stock underwent huge changes in price and volatility, which means the contract increased via delta and vega proportionally.",['GME'],0

It also won't be fooled by optical illusions like light glares and shadows (anyone see the video of a Tesla randomly cutting over lanes bc the camera saw a pattern of sunlight caused by shadows that looked like lane dashes?)

Lidar, radar, cameras, ultrasonic - each sensor type has it's limitations and advantages.  Sensor fusion is the process of combining that data to get more reliable probabilities of the real world.  You don't need them all, but relying solely on cameras seems like a step backwards. 

But, ya know... do your own research:

Roblox will \*not\* fail, but it is \*not\* going to be an avenue for future growth.

The concept is sound, but for context Roblox is far less developed and is far narrower in scope than other things that have done this.

For a comparison, Roblox is essentially ""Youtube Kids"" in metaverse. We don't consider YouTube Kids something new and innovative, just like Roblox isn't.

Likewise, Youtube has content that targets younger demographics, as does Youtube Kids. But YouTube Kids is \*only\* that demographic.

Roblox will be profitable, what it will not be is a growth stock. However, this is a concept that \*will\* be a growth stock from something else that tries this, without the hamstringing Roblox has put on itself.

As mentioned, the problem that exists with these platforms is they are based on their foundation codebase and engine tech and firmly stuck to it.

9688,gziaxp4,2021-05-26,t3_nld88o,wallstreetbets,"Hourly reminder that AMC is **insanely risky** relative to GME.

AMC is currently trading at a $9000mm market cap... prepandemic levels placed this at $600mm.

AMC has had **no bullish news** for **years**.

The stock is relying *entirely on buy pressure that is detached from the company's actual value.* This **only works in tech companies, because you're investing in the technology and market ownership**.

AMC has **no room to grow in the cinema industry in the USA**. 

AMC has diluted shares from 50m to 500m... raising **billions of dollars**. They **still have debt**.

So why is GME better? Because it *doesn't need a squeeze.* It has more investors, despite what forum sliders want you to believe. It has institutional investors, because of the fundamental value proposition posed by Ryan Cohen and the team they're building.

The company has 99% market share to grow into, and an exploding technological industry to take advantage of. Theyre rapidly and radically transforming their product offerings and their delivery models.

The stock is still undervalue.

If RC had launched a startup with the same vision that Gamestop has... it would be valued *more than Gamestop currently is* at its IPO.

Gamestop has an established customer base, that is now expanding into Europe.

Wake up guys.

AMC isn't it. It never was. It never will be. They aren't working with Gamestop.

Gamestop is safe on its own strengths. It doesn't need a squeeze. It will continue to grow overtime regardless.","['GME', 'AMC']",1
