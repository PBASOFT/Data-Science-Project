That sure makes it sound like you have little to no disposable income, and if that is the case you absolutely should not have your money tied up in any type of risky investments. 

If you are going to tie your money up in higher risk investments like the stock market you need to do your homework beforehand. It’s not impossible to do that from an app, but it’s considerably more difficult to research and analyze company finances on a 5” screen. 

“Investment” apps are not brokerages. If you are investing your money you need to invest with a proper brokerage. They all have apps as well if you feel like your best investment decisions are made on the go. People should not be asking “which app is the best for me to invest” they should be asking “which brokerage best suits my needs.” If someone does not understand the distinction then they have not done enough research to be investing. Apps such as Robinhood just proved that when they let a bunch of ignorant people get on their app and gave them margin to buy and extremely risky stock in an elaborate pump and dump and then get fucked over because they don’t have enough money to handle the transactions, which would not have been the case at a real brokerage.

Berkshire never split their main stock because they wanted their investor base to be small and high value - like institutions or high net worth individuals. They don't want it particularly liquid.

Tesla split their stock because they wanted a larger investor base and for it to be accessible to retail investors because they believed that institutions didn't believe in them. They wanted it very liquid.

NVidia's leadership clearly believes that at the current price and given the current trends that the stock is becoming less liquid because the price-per-share is trending out of the range that casual investors are willing to trade in, so they are splitting the stock to bring it back into the 100-200 range which will make it more liquid.

The moment someone sees profit to take, they take profit. In theory a single share available for trade can be sold and bought exactly at break even price to get out. Just imagine it like a huge chain of dominos. That said, this is very unlikely and requires more than just buying shares - though that is also not necessary by miles.

Considering the shares dropped to below 15$ there are probably a ton of people that are looking right now at a 80-100% profit and can sell at any time. Once sold you have a large volume and if shorts were interested to cover, then they can. There is nothing spectacular about this. Also the borrow rates are not set in stone, not per broker and especially not per customer. Also considering the moving amount is 16M a day, that's less than 3 days to cover on average movement, but this is also an illusion. If one covers the shares that were borrowed go back at expense of the buyer and the millions of shares can be bought by the next large short seller.

605,gzem3t7,2021-05-25,t3_nknrag,stocks,"Really depends what you search the stock for: trading or investing. 

• Investing: I love dividend stocks (can share the ones I hold if you want), as when dividends are reinvested, it results in compound growth
- management, previous track record especially if there’s a change in the board
- amount of cash they have as it’s something they’ll always be able to rely on
- P/E and P/S ratios
- dividend payout ratio (ratio of the dividend to net income, as it means less money is reinvested into the company)
- I also own a few ETFs that I count on holding until retirement and also count on reinvesting received dividends

Trading: got burnt a lot over Feb and March, more stressful and overall time consuming so don’t recommend
- catalysts such as earnings and positive news about their performance or something coming up (be an early mover, don’t follow if it’s already up 100% in 3 months)
- growth potential and addressable market as well as future outlook - if you get caught holding the bag (like FUBO, SKLZ, NIO, PLUG, etc.) you can turn it into a long term investment

Once again, only long term investing has been working for me with strong and settled companies.

Its a single video game... yes the business model is very interesting and i am sure it does nicely, but 50.721B for a video game is a lot.


By comparison, Activision is a whole bunch of highly successful games which earns far more money, and they're only worth 75.021B.



I think Roblox is very overvalued.



In pure numbers, activision made 8.09 billion USD in 2020, and roblox made $920 million.


Additionally as a gamer, i think even the most successful games rarely last forever. A game still played 20 games years later is a miracle, and the revenue is usually down by a lot, no matter how great it is.
