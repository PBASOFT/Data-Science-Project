How to interpret these numbers:

If you were to sell a covered call on SPY 6.07% above the weeks opening price, you should expect to see your shares taken away once every 100 weeks. Past performance is not indicative of future performance, but these numbers have been compiled from inception to now, and include about 1000-1500 weeks of data.",nh615i,[],0

While they haven't necessarily topped out, aside from collecting the high dividend yield, I don't see a clear or significant upside anymore. This is also considering Mortgage REITS historically tend to trade within 1-2% of book value.

Or given my low cost basis, would I be better off continuing to hold and collect the 7-9% div?",nh758k,[],0

474,2021-05-20,stocks,"Hey, guys! Thanks for taking time to read this. This is my first post here, but I know you are best equipped to handle this over the other subs I follow.

I know my strengths, and I also know my weaknesses. It's my recognized weakness I need assistance with.

Like many, I started in the markets last year. My 1099 for 2020 was a $22,000 loss in the biggest bull run in history. My 2021 is at $0 due to exiting positions at my CB out of fear of further losses. 

I feel you need to understand more about me to offer more sound advice, so, in short: I'm in my late 30s. I spent most of my 20s in and out of homelessness. Sleeping in basements of relatives, friends couches, out of my Jeep Cherokee. I was a failure. The only thing good in my life, was the love of my life, who left me due to me being such a financial disaster. I tried. I really did. I just always failed.

After she left, I fell into alcohol, prescription drugs, and depression. I eventually tried the only thing I hadn't tried - crime. I failed at that, too. I did 4 years in prison.

Since I was released 4 years ago, I have tried to start over. Nobody will hire me now. It took me a solid year to find an employer willing to give me a chance. I work 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, and finally earn a 6 figure salary. The problem is it's killing me. I now have a 180 resting blood pressure and a 14 cortisol level. I'm dying. I can't sustain this forever. I'm trying to use this opportunity to get ahead while I can. Now I keep failing.

My issue: I don't trust myself. I spend hours on DD, and will have a few stocks I like - companies I believe in. I'll wait for an entry, but when it comes, I'm scared to buy it. I hesitate. Then it rallies. Then I get anxiety because I missed it. I get depressed because I was right but failed to act. I can't chase it now because that's what led to my 2020 losses - chasing something only to buy in just before it consolidates. Then I'm depressed because I'm failing again. 

It's like, when the price comes down, I'm scared to buy because it might go lower and I fail. If it goes higher, I don't buy it because I feel like a sucker for not buying it at the lower price yesterday. Then it rallies, and then I get depression anxiety over missing it. Sometimes just having my mouse over the buy button can cause a panic attack. 

Normally I would say I just need to index, but I don't have 30 years to index. I may have another 2 years in me before this job kills me. I will never have another opportunity like this being a felon. I'm trying to seize opportunity and finally make a good enough gain, that I can then invest much more conservatively moving forward. 

My 2 losses last year would have been my biggest gains had I held  - my DD was correct. Even my price targets were correct. I couldn't trust myself. I tried to learn from this. Now I was up $80,000 YTD on 3 positions, but now I have $0 because I rode them all the way down trying not to panic sell like last year. If I hold - I fail. If I sell - I fail. I'm obviously good at picking winners, but how do I get out of my own way? Every time I act, I was wrong. Every time I fail to act, I was right. How can I ever trust myself given my history? How can I learn to overcome this mental obstacle - this crippling doubt?

I'm really trying to be a winner, but I'm really losing heart.",nh8jr8,[],0

499,2021-05-20,stocks,"I've seen lots of discussion and recommendations regarding small and mid cap companies set to outperform the S&P and the big boys into the future.

Is this actually the case? Looking at the past decade (I know this doesn't predict future performance per say) but the large caps have grown considerably. AAPL for example doubled from 1T to 2T market cap in just two years which is wild. I know their growth has slowed since then but with them constantly killing earnings and continuously diversifying (M chips etc. ) is there any reason for them to slow or be outperformed by smaller companies this decade? I know they're considered a little overvalued, but that's the nature of large cap growth stocks in general.

Additionally, inflation tends to be less hard on large caps compared to smaller ones. Depending on how much inflation is coming over the next say 3-5 years, won't this also be another advantage for the largest cap companies?

764,2021-05-20,stocks,"So my parents passed away when I was very young, and as a result a trust account was set up in my name for a portion of the social security money received monthly. They passed when I was 2/3, so it was quite a bit by the time I reached 18. Coupled with my great-grandparents (who were absolutely gems and raised me until 10/11) adding a bit from their estate, upon dispersement, there was a pretty penny.

I’ve long been interested in investing, but I’m 24 and I haven’t had any real extra money since living on my own at 18. After this though, I’d like to put at least $1,000 into some kind of investment; after reading about the absolute SHITE that is interest on savings accounts—and I don’t want to blow all of it because I have little restraint/budgeting knowledge—I thought I could take a portion and try to make some actual money with it. I’m willing to put at most $5k…because if I lose that, it would SUCK but I would be okay.

If you guys have any insight/tips, advice or….any guidance at all, I would greatly appreciate it. I have…very little knowledge about the intricacies of trading and really just have had an impulse to invest a few times….which if I HAD done, with the money I didn’t have to lose at the time, would have made bank… like I could have bought Tesla when they first went public, but thought just because I like the company doesn’t mean anything and it was too confusing to try to learn.

981,2021-05-20,stocks,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 20, 2021**

Stocks snapped their modest three-day losing streak and jumped higher today, with market participants encouraged by the Weekly Unemployment Report and inflationary fears tempering. As I said yesterday, I was encouraged to see volatility decreasing this week after the wild swing the market experienced recently and am even more encouraged by today’s movement that the sharp sell-off was overdone. 

The Department of Labor released their Weekly Unemployment Report, which showed 444,000 new jobless claims filed, a fresh pandemic low and marginally better than the 450,000 expected by economists. To put this into context, in April of last year, more than 6 million individuals filed jobless claims in one week. While the improvement in the labor market has been extremely encouraging, in the Federal Reserve’s April meeting minutes (basically notes about what was discussed in the meeting) noted “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals”.  

However, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Fed’s argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Fed’s view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be “transitory” and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also noted “a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.
