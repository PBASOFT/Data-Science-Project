I think they have failed to establish that as being a positive. The US for many years had no governing body for its currency and as a result every state was minting its own and that was a disaster; so much so we replaced that system with a governing body. The banking houses of Europe used to mint bank specific currency and that was a disaster; so much so that centralized governing bodies got created.

Bottom line, ""building wealth"" is just that. A steady process. You're at a major advantage where if your living expenses are $2k/month, that's only $24k/year out of your $125k current salary. You can be investing $80-100k/year, which is huge.

What's going to burn you is trying to get rich quick. You found a taste of this via crypto and lost on Dogecoin and it's recent dump. That's the thing - crypto is volatile and risky, but if you get in when one's low and sell high, you can make a killing. Let's say you dumped $25k into Dodge at 0.005 cents and sold at .60 cents. The same goes for a lot of single stocks.

IMO, you're not doing bad just going into the S&P for now. Your real money maker is going to be what you're putting in, amassing a good chunk in there over a few years, and letting that ride. The compounding will take off at some point.

However, you may still want to section off 10-15% of your investing for more risky investing like crypto and single stocks. You can make a buck here and quick, but just expect to lose out too.

My advice would be have different tiers of investing. Max out your 401k and put it into a target date fund and be done with it. For retirement, you're set then. Below that might be other mutual funds you're heavily investing in, taxed of course, but still things like the S&P, overall stock market, dividend growth style funds. This would be for cash you want to have pre-retirement, but still a ways off.

Then tier 3, the risky ones. Like crypto and single stocks. 5-10% of your NW. Play with it, have fun, figure it out. Expect to lose here, but also maybe make a bit.",[],1

Our assumption being that while Alphabet, Tesla and Apple in the FSKAX fund may take a hit for a year of inflation, health care will not. Even if it yields less.

Then our plan is to invest our dividends back into the funds and invest more savings into both once we've recouped what we're spending on our home renovation. We save about $3K a month so we'll roughly be back to a six figure savings account by December.

Slow compounding interest is what makes people rich. Not super risky investments (even though there can be a place for those in your portfolio, I certainly have a few in mine).  
Investing in the S&P 500 I believe gives you an average return of 6% a year. If you start at age 24 and you have an initial 150,000$ invested into the S&P, with an extra $1000 investment at the end of each month, and you repeat this process until you're 65, you'll have $3,871,649 invested, from which only $150,000 is initial cost, and only $492,000 are monthly deposits. That's quite the retirement. If you factor in a 3% inflation rate and rise in monthly deposits every year, it'll be $4,966,725. If you do it until you're 75 instead of 65, it'll be $9,658,551. Patience and compound makes you rich.  
You can crunch the numbers yourself depending on your situation:  
https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php  
Even if your income is way less (this previous example was for a guy making 120k$ a year), it can be super effective if you start early and keep compounding throughout your life. Different variables would make it look like this.  
Initial deposit: $50,000  
Interest rate: 6%  
Years: 41 (until you're 65?)  
Deposit per month: $500  
Future investment value: $1,644,922

So, again, if we limit it to the short term, I would agree that BTC is a risky, speculative growth asset. But that's just a side-effect of its growing pains. Major institutional players have been pouring hundreds of millions of $ into BTC. The financial web is solidifying, and with it, will come stability.

Pea brained take, basic logic tells you correlation does not equal causation.  How do you explain the rise in BTC from 2009-2017 then?  Stablecoins have been needed and predicted to happen since like 2013, it's a market need.  As crypto gains more adoption > more stablecoins are needed.  Simple logic man.

Meaning, they found some suspicious stuff.  But clearly didn't think it was worth prosecuting over.  They got a slap on the wrist and life went on.  2016-2017 tether got in trouble, but at the time they were a small % of crypto trading.  They've since resolved the issue.

First off, most people don't experience that. I know people who can't even open a bank account (and I live in the U.S. of A.). So there's that.

I personally hold Bitcoin as a store of value. I own stocks and mutual funds and I also have Bitcoin. So far, Bitcoin has outpaced my other savings devices. So I'm not going to talk theoretical, it's a simple fact of my life.

As far as banking and exchange of value (another function of money), I can get a loan through crypto, but I can't get a loan through a bank (which is a service a bank should be able to provide). The UI on the infrastructure will improve over time. 

Do you use Venmo? PayPal? CashApp? Why would you use any of these instead of a traditional bank?

>We've had fractional reserves going back to the 1400s, there stopped being a gold standard in the USA in the 70s, this isn't new.

This is why I suggest you read a little history. America wasn't kicking in the 1400s. Meanwhile the 1970s wasn't that long ago. The U.S. stopped being a gold standard for citizens in the 1930s, but stopped for other countries 40 years later, so think about how long these things take to percolate and are on the scale of about 500 years.

I legitimately cannot comprehend how anyone can look at the price action of any cryptocurrency and conclude that it functions as a ""store of value."" A store of value shouldn't lose 25% of its purchasing power overnight for no reason. Nor should it appreciate 200% in a year. 

>BTC \*has\* intrinsic value. It's coded into the software itself. 

This is a circular statement that proves nothing. 

>So, again, if we limit it to the short term, I would agree that BTC is a risky, speculative growth asset. But that's just a side-effect of its growing pains. Major institutional players have been pouring hundreds of millions of $ into BTC. The financial web is solidifying, and with it, will come stability.

I've been hearing this same argument for 12 years and absolutely nothing has changed. 

>Though, I have to ask, what effect does this have: ""the amount of actual money in the system is a tiny fraction relative to the unbacked stablecoins inflating the market""?

I used to invest in physical silver. I still have some. It's pretty neat to have a couple of bars and shiney coins, but that's basically where the benefits stop. Physical PMs are a pain in the ass to transact in -- bid / ask spreads are VERY wide at local dealers and at big online retailers. In order to get good execution you almost always have to sell online which takes time and effort (meeting people from craigslist, taking risks mailing money and metals through the mail, or driving to meet people at banks). Running eBay auctions put you at risk during bouts of volatility as auctions take days to complete. Moving houses or apartments with a bunch of bars and tubes of silver was also kind of a pain. Depending on how big your stack is / gets storage can become an issue too.

In hindsight I quickly regretted going the bullion route. SLV is just so much easier. The one exception is if you're going the buillion route because you like the collecting aspect of things (think numismatics, buying rounds or bars with historical context or interesting artwork), but if this is your M.O. then you're not really investing, but rather pursuing a hobby.

>I've been hearing this same argument for 12 years, but I guess ""this time is different""?

12 years is absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of things for a fundamentally new type of currency. Literally nothing. Again, it boils to the short/long term distinction. 

And ""this time"" is different, just as every day is different, in the sense that the market cap has simply grown over time. I bet we can have this exact discussion 12 more years down the road, and you could still bring up the same arguments, but with the same trend for cryptos. 

>This is a circular statement that proves nothing.

To the extent you are implying there's a logical fallacy, you're simply wrong. That occurs if both the following statements are true: If A then B; and If B then A. BTC's intrinsic value as currency is a function of its portability, durability, fungibility, recognizability, durability, divisibility, acceptability, uniformity, and limited supply. Which, again, flows from the software itself. The reverse just makes no sense. The intrinsic value of BTC does not create those characteristics; it's the other way around.

>Because the peg is an absolute fiction. Only a vanishingly small fraction of tethers are backed by real money.

This is new to me (though I confess I don't really follow stablecoins). If true, then this merely reinforces the sentiment in my prior statement. Not only are stablecoins different from BTC et al, but the *reason* they are different (the peg) is now revealed to be a (partial) farce.

I'm getting better at being patient, holding cash or buying into low risk stuff even though the money is burning a hole in my pocket.

Some would say silver is different has more industrial uses, but I largely argue that it's the other way around. If you can use something like copper/silver to mimic even 90% of the utility of gold then you wouldn't use gold in that process/item unless it's specifically to drive up value cost. The reason is because gold costs more. Gold costs more because it's rarer and harder to obtain. 

So it keeps boiling down to gold's rarity, availability, and costs to procure.

>I literally just cannot understand why any small personal investor would want to buy silver bullion when gram for gram there is the far more efficient option of gold?

As FP said, silver is more common than gold so it's more accessible and ends up having more liquidity and uses than gold. It's not the whole case, but if you want to simplify it then that's mostly the reason. For smaller investors BRK-B exists because they can't buy BRK-A.

Other investors choose to short the rarity of gold and commonness of silver. For example, the historic silver:gold ratio has been throw stray recently because the advent of electric vehicles and role silver plays in the batteries. Is it because gold can't be used?

In other words ARK isn't ""the market."" And by choosing to invest in ARK, you are in many ways timing the market by choosing a certain set of stocks over others, and by having an active manager (Wood) try to time the market on your behalf with buy/sell decisions. 

Look at it this way; value investing, a style that encompasses a far broader set of stocks than ARK has been out of favor for almost two decades now, so the idea that you are owed a fresh ATH this year or even within 5 years is dubious based on what we know about investing styles going in and out of favor...to say nothing of ""hot"" actively managed fund strategies.",[],0

Data centers can become troublesome in the quest for decentralization because they’re often held by corporations. Node counts can also help skew public opinion through what are known as Sybil attacks. Sybil attacks can overinflate influence in a peer-to-peer system, making it appear there to be more consensus than the actual reality. These are real concerns for consensus networks like Bitcoin.

551,gyut4t7,2021-05-20,t3_ngnide,investing,"Those are two very different mutual funds. You need to pick what kinds of mutual funds you want to invest in before making an apples and oranges comparison. An S&P 500 Index fund is naturally going to have a low expense ratio, as there is little to no work involved in picking what stocks will be in the fund. It is the 500 largest companies on the NYSE, simple as that. The other fund you listed is a fund whose stocks have been specifically curated by the funds management. It targets stocks within a specific sector and then through qualitative, quantitative, and technical analysis the fund’s managers choose what stocks to include in the fund. There is way more work involved in this, which is one of the reasons the expense ratio is significantly higher. 

Decide first what kind of funds you want to by. Then compare expense ratios between funds of the same type. You are correct that of the two funds you listed, the Software and IT fund would beat the Index fund regardless of its expense ratio. But this is an apples and oranges comparison. If you instead compare the the Fidelity 500 Index Fund to something like the Fidelity ZERO large cap index fund (both are S&P 500 Index funds) Fidelity ZERO wins all day because it has a 0% expense ratio. 

Morale of the story, don’t put all of your eggs into the Software and IT fund just because it looks better at a glance. It may be beating the market, but it also comes with a much higher risk factor. Decide what types of funds you want to buy first based on your desired level of risk. Then compare the returns and expense ratios within funds of each type.

So my parents passed away when I was very young, and as a result a trust account was set up in my name for a portion of the social security money received monthly. They passed when I was 2/3, so it was quite a bit by the time I reached 18. Coupled with my great-grandparents (who were absolutely gems and raised me until 10/11) adding a bit from their estate, upon dispersement, there’s $17,000.   
I’ve long been interested in investing, but I’m 24 in the US and I haven’t had any real extra money since living on my own at 18. I’m unemployed currently, but starting up again next month/July after having a health issue (paid for).   
After this though, I’d like to put at least $1,000 into some kind of investment; after reading about the absolute SHITE that is interest on savings accounts—and I don’t want to blow all of it because I have little restraint/budgeting knowledge—I thought I could take a portion and try to make some actual money with it. I’m willing to put at most $5k…because if I lose that, it would definitely suck, but I would be okay. I have…very little knowledge about the intricacies of trading and really just have had an impulse to invest a few times….which if I HAD done, with the money I didn’t have to lose at the time, would have made bank… like I could have bought Tesla when they first went public, but thought just because I like the company doesn’t mean anything and it was too confusing to try to learn. I don’t mind risking it, however I’d like to be at least somewhat confident and will do my research on suggestions to make the decision I believe in.   
I actually have a bit of Doge….as in I have like $50 worth. I bought it at $0.35, if that helps. And I only have one debt of $800 from being a stupid college kid who got a credit card for the first time while literally wasting money at an out-of-state school. I otherwise previously had $0 in savings so I’m just not willing to put any more than $5,000 in. That said,  if I come across or am suggested a stock I can really get behind and believe in I absolutely can and will invest it.  
If you guys have any insight/tips, advice or….any guidance at all, I would greatly appreciate it.   
So, anyway TL;DR : I’m a complete novice but would GREATLY appreciate some tips for investing $1-5,000.

I think demand for goods and services will grow rapidly as pent-up pandemic demands explode, driving up prices. Supply might overshoot demand at some point as companies try to make a quick buck on high prices - could bounce back and forth for a while. 

I imagine the Fed raising rates based on overall positive signs might cause some chaos - stocks could sink but maybe housing demand increases further as people try to avoid missing out on historically low rates. And all the new homebuyers will be driving retail and durable goods sales. And possibly starting families because that's the ""next step.""

And complications will arise from some parts of the world being fully open while other parts are still shut down.

Try to see if any of those events have occurred and if management was correct in their hypothesis. This shows a sound understanding of the business. 

2) I would replace Debt with Debt Management. Debt is not inherently bad, but it must be used to further entrench the Moat of a business or increase earnings power proportionally more than the cost of servicing the debt. A great and often used bad example of this is AT&T. They have incurred piles of debt with little to no benefit to the earnings power of the company and in their case their debt actually weakened their Moat as it indirectly is responsible for the rise of TMobile as a legitimate competitor.

3) This is the toughest to judge IMO but in general you should prefer that management is paid in salary and not stock options, but simultaneously owns significant equity in the company. This guarantees that management is not incentivized to pump the share price or manipulate numbers to increase the options they receive while also giving them skin in the game so their primary focus is the long term health of the company. I suppose a private placement could be related to that but I think that would be more correlated to #2.",[],0

I'm sure if I were buying 500 million shares of some company, I'd at least have a few lunches with the managers to get to know them.

Now, I haven't done any hard analysis but I would guess that because my focus tends to be steeply undervalued securities, how much or how little time I spent investigating management had very little bearing on the outcome of the investment... so I'm not really sure how much of that is worth the average investor's time.

It should be fairly evident from the financial history of a company whether management has been effective at producing optimal results while mitigating risk exposure.

Gold and silver are only for protection against inflation. Stocks from businesses that generate somewhat secure cashflow and pay dividends, and real state are for growth. Starting businesses is for thriving.

The only thing crypto is actually useful for is a pump and dump without legal repercussions and underworld transactions that would get you jailed. Otherwise, it's a casino with a cult following that you make a part of.

If you bought and hold world.com in 2000, stocks didn't go up.

OP, you entered the market during one of its most volatile times when the money supply and deficit are off the charts while interest rates are at an all time low and there are new, big, unregulated investments (crypto) while there is an unprecedented influx of retail investors.

Nothing was normal about it. Nothing is normal about it now.

Recency bias is affecting a ton of investors, making them believe this is normal. They think it's normal to make a 20% return on a stock in a month. They think it's normal for companies to trade at 200+ times their equity or earnings. 

If you can't figure out why the market is doing what it's doing, it's because no one else can either. And I mean no one. I have friends who are money managers for Fidelity who say the same thing.

I am 31 years old and am looking for some advice on how to invest in my ROTH IRA and 401(K). Both accounts are through Fidelity. I have decided to go with a [Three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio).

The first question I have is which fund(s) I should choose? I have narrowed my selections down to the following.

1. [**VT**](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/vt/portfolio) (Expense ratio of 0.08% and quarterly dividends with a yield of 1.83%.)

2. [**VTI**](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/vti/portfolio) (Expense ratio of 0.03% and quarterly dividends with a yeild of 1.4%) and [**VXUS**](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/xnas/vxus/portfolio) (Expense ratio of 0.08% and quarterly dividends with a yield of 2.3%)

3. [**FZROX**](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/fzrox/portfolio) (Expense ratio of 0% and annual dividends with a yield of 1.47%) and [**FZILX**](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/fzilx/portfolio) (Expense ratio of 0% and annual dividends with a yield of 2.27%)

And, my second question is if I don't go with VT what domestic/international split should I use?

1. Global market-capitalization weight (~60% domestic/ ~40% international)


2. Tilting domestic

     2a. 70% domestic/30% international

     2b. 80% domestic/20% international

*How old are you? What country do you live in?
28, USA.

*Are you employed/making income? How much?
Will be starting a PhD this year, so just enough income to meet expenses for the next ~5 years. Have enough money set aside as an emergency fund, a year's espenses, and to deal with settling in a different city.

*What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)
Retirement savings. Maybe buy a house but don't really know where I'm going to end up. A house in Ohio is quite a different goal than a house in SF bay area.

*What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
No need for the money in at least 20 years.

*What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
Prefer safety

*What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)
1. corporate bonds: 170k generating 15k-ish total net income a year. About half indexed to Tesla and half to SPX/RTY/NDX/

Macro forces: There's over 100T in bonds, 30T of which with negative real yield, whose principle is at risk as rates rise (a bond with 10y duration will lose 10% each percent). Enter 0.8T asset that doesn't debase, does great in inflation, is moderately uncorrelated, and is easy to custody. 

Debt trap: With the explosion in debt (and trillions more coming) the government owes $280B/year for each percent increase. If it got to 4% that'd be the equivalent of paying for a second US military. The government can't afford to let rates get that high and will have to implement some level of yield curve control which ultimately means dollar debasement. 

Sovereignty: Self custody optionality, no counterparty risk, 24/7 access, borderless, decentralized, publicly auditable. 

Yield: Blockfi, staking, and defi offer yields that absolutely crush savings accounts. 

Other arguments: 

* The [sound money](https://imgur.com/a/chbFIp5) argument. 
* The [network effect/metcalfe's law](https://twitter.com/raoulgmi/status/1347013577559990273) argument. 
* The [comparable asset](https://cdn.howmuch.net/articles/bitcoin-money-economy-in-perspective-7dd6.jpg) argument. 
* The [stock to flow](https://twitter.com/filbfilb/status/1363466784360321024) commodity argument. 
* The [moral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLYYh4aPXAM) argument. 
* The [sharpe ratio](https://imgur.com/a/eUHYmaQ) argument. 

For Bitcoin specifically: biggest computing network on the planet, the longest most secure blockchain, hardcore coder base, secured low cost clean energy infrastructure, facilities infrastructure, political inroads (donors, government members, advocacy groups), largest userbase, battle tested history, most legal due diligence, most investment vehicles, over the $1T minimum for the largest funds (pensions/etc) to start allocating, no [unpredictable monetary policy](https://docs.ethhub.io/assets/images/issuance_graph.png), institutional infrastructure (Paypal, Square, Visa, Mastercard, JPM, Melon Bank, Blackrock, CME, Goldman Sachs, Fidelity Digital Services, ETF/ETNs, Coinbase/Gemini Custody), corporate treasury buy in (Mass Mutual, Square, Microstrategy, Harvard/Yale/Brown Endowments), brand name...

Money was also just the first application. Beyond that there are projects for decentralized file storage, computation, data markets, community tokens etc. 

There are lots of different reasons for different people. The institutions and smart investors are thinking very macro while individuals are drawn more to the sovereignty and return aspects. Serious VC firms like a16z are investing in these decentralized apps.",[],0

So basically, I would say this is basically ACWI with even more of a US tilt (ACWI already has a US tilt since US has highest market cap) and even more of a tech tilt (US tech is largest market cap). 

So basically ACWI is already what you are going for with tilting to US and US tech, but if you want even more tilt to these sectors go for it.

Personally, I'm trying to do the opposite. Tilt away from US and US tech as much as possible. Actually I don't think US tech valuations are that bad, but US valuations as a whole are bad and tech valuations I think are better but still not great.",[],0

But stock picking, in the long run, is a losing game because growth tends to come disproportionately from a small portion of companies. That is, the cheap haystack is a better buy than the expensive attempt to dig through it, in part because, on average, those attempts fail. 

Using your example, the S&P 500 comparison is unfair: the difference in performance has to do mostly with sector/industry exposure, not active management. Compare it instead to VITAX, vanguard's IT index. It holds 331 companies (haystack), compared to FSCSX's 71. Keeping with what we would expect, the passive (ER .1%) index has outperformed the active one by 6% 1 year, 3% 3 year, and 3% 5 year.

Also eliminates the ability for the investor to claim the foreign tax credit, but that's not an issue in a tax-advantaged account anyway.  VT really is a great ETF for starting investors to hold onto until complexity finds them and it makes more sense to slice and dice.  

Global market cap weighting (VT) is basically the neutral starting point that makes the most sense for most people.   Still, there are some arguments for tilting.  For example, some people overweighting emerging markets based on their collective GDP being much higher than the market cap weight the global index gives them, but it's debatable whether or not that's a good strategy.   A lot of people have a tilt toward their home countries because it makes sense for tax reasons, which makes sense for people with a lot of money invested, not so much for new investors.   In the end, you do want global diversification in some way, so you're definitely on the right track.  

Vanguard wrote a whitepaper about why they recommend global market cap weighting (VT), and a lot of the other big firms are basically in agreement that global diversification is important.
