I'm not recommending you add more (I'm also not recommending you don't, I'm not a financial advisor), but if you do I would strongly consider purchasing some moderately-ITM leaps (middle of '22 or later) to DRASTICALLY reduce your cost basis (not overall cost), far more than buying more individual shares, and you're giving yourself plenty of time to be right about your thesis. And, if you are buying ITM, then you can sell some of the more reasonable CC's that are currently available to lower your cost basis further. If they get assigned, they get assigned, you turn a profit and then can potentially buy new call options based on where you think the price will go from there. 

In the meantime you can even potentially use the credit gained from the CCs to purchase more individual shares and keep lowering cost basis, if that's your thing (although with where you're at contracts are really how you'd lower the cost basis).",[],0

Everything for this company comes down to this one drug-Lupkynis (voclosporin).  But this one drug has the potential to being a wonder drug for people with Lupus and a big moneymaker in the coming years that should propel AUPH stock.

Some reasons why this drug will be big are the facts that it has shown high efficacy and a  high safety profile long term in various trials carried out.  It also has very little real competition as a prescribed medication.  Lupkynis is given in pill form which is easier for administration. The only other competitor of note for patients with Lupus is Benlysta, a drug which has poorer noted efficacy and a worse safety profile and is adminstered through IV or injection so physicians are likely going to prescribe Lupkynis first for their patients .

In regards to the moneymaking aspect ... cost per patient annually is high at $65,000 using Lupkynis.  It is believed that in a couple years  (after ramping up) it will generate sales of 1.5-2 billion dollars annually based on the number of people with Lupus in the US and other places in the world that would likely be prescribed this drug.

Aurinia has exclusive rights to this drug till 2037 so bigger Pharm. companiees will be sniffing around over the coming months.

As the OP said, the likelihood for buyout is very high here.  It could happen this year or next as the earnings rise with increasing patient usage.  

I've seen a range of values for future share price.  I'm not an analyst so if you have interest you should read what others are predicting.  It really depends on the buyout and when that happens, but some believe it could hit anywhere from $20-30 within a year.   Long term it could go much higher...",[],1

We are past the max price 52 target by the most bullish analyst of $16 and the institutional investors that are still in AMC might all dump tomorrow, which would be massive amount shares selling off tomorrow.

Will be interesting to see how it plays out this week.  If it really squeezes tomorrow or Thursday could spark a stampede for the exits and that‚Äôs where the puts pay off big.

In both careers and relationships, to stand in strength, navigate with poise, and evolve with purpose, it is important to humbly acknowledge and respect endings when they come. Adopting a different vantage point with clarity need not invalidate the importance of past versions and visions; recognizing incompatibilities between characters, will, and ambitions while learning from past faults need not nullify the positive imprint that people have left on our lives. Not all ill-fitting pieces are bad pieces and even bad pieces are not completely devoid of positive projections. Some have allowed us to feel out our own edges, smoothed and strengthened them in the process of collectively trying to make things work. Disappointment, surprise, and grief do not negate the finality, inevitability, and weight of the conclusion, even though it is human nature to delay the admission as such. Things will rarely, if ever, end as a well-deserved deep and hard slumber on a perfectly supple bed of fresh linen, on the backdrop of an amber-crimson sunset bleeding itself indistinguishably into the baby blue skyline. Although, looking back, the lines of where it all started may have become blurry, the line of where things end should not be an arbitrary one. It should be decisive and intentional.

We did talk to him, and to the team in general, about overzealousness in removing posts. To empathize with him, in late January / early February, it was chaotic to say the least, and we were all more heavy handed than usual.

We've done a pretty big 180 since then actually. I do my best to leave warnings instead of bans (even short bans) and zjz amended the bots to do same. We also implemented a ""DD revival"" process, where any DD that gets removed gets put into a queue for everyone to see (on discord)

Back to your point though, just looking at his past 84 thread removals (from Feb 26th onwards), 13 are GME, and 6 are AMC, which is a pretty low proportion IMO. The remainder were mostly SPACs. All of them (I only skimmed them) seem pretty reasonable removals, so my guess is we did talk to him and things calmed down -- but probably not as fast as would be optimal.","['GME', 'AMC']",1

So he bought contracts (while GME was below 50/share) to buy GME at 50 a share. Each contract has an expiration date. So while GME rose above 50/share, he had contracts that gave him the right to buy at only 50/share. 

Thing is, options contracts trade 100 shares at a time. So even though he had the contracts to buy GME at 50/share, he didn‚Äôt have the money to buy 100 shares at 50 a share. 

So what you can do is sell those contracts to other people who have lots of money. If GME was at 100 dollars, then a call option at 50 would potentially make someone 10k off of 5k. 

Thing is, exercising is what it‚Äôs called when you actually buy the shares. So he put his money in options contracts, but he didn‚Äôt have 5k on hand to exercise the call options. So he sold some of his options contracts, made some money, and then exercised a couple of his calls himself and got the shares in his account.

5464,gzgznp3,2021-05-26,t1_gzf2egx,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the gold kinda stranger I didn‚Äôt expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn‚Äôt have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn‚Äôt beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn‚Äôt know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun‚Äô a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn‚Äôt doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I‚Äôve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold. Thank you again kind stranger.",[],0

Do your own DD, take your profit and bounce. This isn't a group investing site. This is a gamble that paid off. Take your cut, look for your out and dip. 

If you want to stay greedy then you'll stay holding. But just look at January. A lot of the smart mofos cashed out BIG when the price hit 300+ and then bought back in when the price crashed. And that's how you WSB. Ignore the meme posts and follow the actual DD.",['GME'],0

But they're pretty strong, fundamentally.  They've got some of the best mines in the world and those mines produce more than just copper. They've got gold exposure as well as a few other valuable metals. 

The biggest concern at the moment is that the price of copper will fall and the market will overreact. FCX isn't going anywhere and there's no reason to think their growth will be capped any time soon.",[],1

It doesn‚Äôt make sense to look at the global population as an unmodified number of human beings walking around. There could be 1 billion humans on the moon but if they don‚Äôt buy much stuff from earth then they aren‚Äôt impacting the global economy. Right now there are billions of people in poverty who don‚Äôt really participate in the global economy.

Look at China. There‚Äôs a huge gap between rent prices in big cities versus the countryside. People in Shanghai participate in the global economy. They pay $700+ per month in rent. People in the Chinese countryside pay $10,000 to buy a house. You could probably rent one for $50 a month. There‚Äôs a massive gap in wages and cost of living. Every year tens of millions of people move from rural China to a city.

That‚Äôs what I think will happen in India and Africa over the rest of my lifetime.

AI will impact the economies of developed countries first but it won‚Äôt hit the developing world for a while. There are billions of people who don‚Äôt have cell phones yet.

They borrow asset from pools such as endowments and pension funds because they have connection with the fund manager and party together. After borrowing they start selling the asset to crash price. This creates panic in us and we sell our positions. They later buy it for cheap and return it to pool making the profit. To make even more profit they could do two more things 1. throttle the supply which crashes the price even more since people can sell more and buy less. So if you went to jewellery store to buy silver they will ask you to wait two months for your order to be fulfilled or in case of RH they banned buying security altogether. 2.

And for anyone reading the reason they HAD to take the buy button away is they would have literally been bankrupt. Why? Because when volatility skyrockets the clearing house makes robinhood front every single dollar of every single buy for TWO DAYS until funds are settled. Millions and millions of shares bought, every single penny of which Robinhood had to front themselves. Same with every other little app based trading platform. Nobody talks about webull or any of the hundreds of other ones that had to do the same. ThEy CaN lIqUiDaTe aT AnY TiMe yeah so can literally every broker. It‚Äôs part of the deal. And if you do something legitimately retarded enough to force your broker to do that YOU fucked up. 
I like robinhood for long term stuff. Pretty much all they are good for. Almost 0 indicators for TA, trading on the website is too slow for day trading, so I just stick with it for long term for ease of use. I wish you good luck OP.

Need a new theoretical method to solve the equations exactly. So as far as reading materials go, this is rather advanced, and you wouldn't really get anywhere with lots of physics knowledge. The four core subjects in physics are Classical Mechanics, Statistical Mechanics/Thermal Physics, Quantum Mechanics, and Electrodynamics.  


The undergrad books for those would be along the lines of 1) Classical Mechanics by Taylor or Analytical Mechanics by Fowles, 2) Thermal Physics by Goodstein, 3) Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by Griffiths, and 4) Introduction to Electrodynamics by Griffiths.  


The graduate level for those four areas are 1) Classical mechanics by Goldstein, 2) Statistical Mechanics by Pathria, 3) Principles of Quantum Mechanics by Shankar, Advanced Quantum Mechanics by Sakurai, and An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory by Peskin and Schroeder, 4) Classical Electrodynamics by Jackson or Modern Electrodynamics by Zangwill.  


From there, you can start to understand most condensed matter books since condensed matter physics is an area of applied quantum mechanics.

At current options valuation if 9:50 falls into the money by then I'm looking at a $3,500 return on my $10 spread if I buy 10 spreads that's 35,000 for my $100.

8932,gzh8jma,2021-05-26,t1_gzgys0w,wallstreetbets,"It IS realistic to get an entry level job within 6 months making close to 6 figures (or above 6 figures if you negotiate mad interview well). However please note that this is 6 months of hard, dedicated work (let's say 3-5 hours a day). Even if your mind has an inclination to coding (i.e. you're analytical, like problem solving and puzzles, and/or love creating things), programming anything past the basics is still a bitch to learn and the #1 skill is learning how to be patient and persistent in the face of confusion and frustration

As to the question of which language... The important thing is not which language, but rather that you pick a language and get quite good with it, building up a portfolio of as many websites and apps as you can before you start applying full time to positions (or pursuing clients if freelance is more your jam)

Some general guidelines:
If you love graphic design, site layouts and organization, creating slick animations, etc, that's called ""front end"" and you should hands down learn html, css, and JavaScript because that's what will power all of that. Better yet, learn Typescript because typed languages have certain guardrails that will make your life easier down the road.

If you wanna program AI, the learn python. It's easy to pick up and there's TONS of resources to get up and running. However please note that learning data science with python is not the same as learning ""programming"" and unless you have complementing engineering skills (which you can totally develop in python as well) you may find it more difficult to find a 6 figure entry level job. IMO, data science skills + dev skills is a combo that will guarantee a $$$ career for many many years to come. It's the path I'm currently on.

If you wanna program on the blockchain and build the infrastructure for the future krypto economy (and as a wsb person I assume you have some interest in financial things), then I'd recommend learning Solidity. I don't have personal experience with it but I can tell you it's #1 on my to-do list. Being able to whip up smart contracts and decentralized apps is going to be a üî•üî•skillset and guess what? NOBODY has more than 3 years experience lol so imo it's one of the best things to start with.

If you want to create mobile apps for Android: learn Kotlin. Kotlin is like Java 2.0 and it's better in every way as far as I can tell.
If you want to create mobile apps for iOS : learn Swift

Although I haven't done this myself, I've heard from pople that if you're able to get an iOS app published on the App Store, then you're basically guaranteed a job at a big tech company like Microsoft or w.e. 

Bonus: Look I'm not gonna hate on Ruby on Rails lol a lot of companies are built on it. I just had a bad experience with Ruby... But who knows if you learn it the right way it's a great way of getting exposed to the ""full stack"" of a web application (i.e. the UI, the server/backend organization, and the database)

If you want to create games look into Unity. Game programming is another beast than what I do so you're best getting advice from others.",['AI'],0

If I asked you what would have performed better since 1950 if you bought a 1.25x re-levered SP500 or bought the index at a 0% expense ratio, the upward drift nature has overrode the negative vol drag if you recreate the series and the 1.25x re-levered outperforms. This is to say, it‚Äôs not as simple as daily re-leverage is automatically a money loser in the long run, assuming a random walk with an upward drift 1x daily re-levered returns is not optimal and instead you should be re-leveraging (assuming a low enough cost of course on the leverage).",[],0
