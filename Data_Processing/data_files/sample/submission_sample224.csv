Kinder Morgan has the largest natural gas transmission network with \~70 thousand miles of natural gas pipelines, 659 bcf of storage capacity, and \~1200 miles of NGL. The company is the largest independent transporter of refiner products \~6800 miles of refined product pipelines and \~3100 miles of crude pipelines.

Kinder Morgan is also the largest independent terminal operator with 144 terminals & 16 Jones Act vessels. These together enabled the company to increase natural gas income during the Texas storm, something that wasn't a one-off. The company is the largest CO2 transporter with \~1.5 bcf/day of capacity, showing its strength.

* Kinder Morgan benefited off of the Texas Storm with its DCF expected to reach almost $6 billion for the year.
* The company has a dividend of almost 6% and it's continuing to invest in its business for the long run.
* The company has an impressive and diverse portfolio of assets which we expect it'll be able to utilize to drive substantial long-term shareholder rewards.

2180,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"I must start this with do not touch your AMC for anything let alone a stock that hasnt even cemented itself in this new world - but the memeconemy is having a revival and with Wall St's apparent dislike of this company through shorts I think UWMC may have a nice place in this new order.

EDIT: short TLDR by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can’t fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It’s a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \(high short float\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",nlpfk9,"['GME', 'AMC']",0

They had a bad report which sent the stock down 50% earlier this year, but recently followed it up with some good data and reports from people in their trials are that their gene therapy produces results.  They will never cure anything, but for kids with muscular distrophy just keeping them from getting worse is as good as a cure.  Cathy Wood took a position and exited it fairly quickly, before the most recent good data.  If they can retrace even half of the move down from earlier this year it would be a big gain.

2189,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"First off. Forget that Blackberry is a phone company. Blackberry is a growth late stage start up that utilizes the logistics and patents of an old phone company

Black berry’s forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let’s start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It’s essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars’ software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla’s self driving cars, they’ll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It’s confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It’s cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That’s $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

This stock is a deep fucking value",nlqklx,['AI'],0
2196,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"Redoing this because I tried to emulate instead of innovate -

TLDR --Premise-- ViaSat, Inc (VSAT) is a mediocre company that provides mediocre satellite service that costs way too much for what it is.... but in many places it is the ONLY option... well it was until Mr. 🚀 himself decided to eat their lunch. StarLink (part of SpaceX) is about to absolutely destroy VSAT and turn it to 💩.

TLDR --Strategy-- since you can't invest in SpaceX (private company) or Starlink (until it is spun off into a separate entity **and then DO invest there** ) I think someone that decides to buy PUTS on VSAT (give yourself A LOT of time, I'm talking June 2022 $35 or Jan 2023 $25) stands to make a lot of money ------ I'm personally not starting my position until right before the next earnings report in August. I figure the first sign of trouble will come out in an earnings report and if it isn't August then by November it'll start showing. Again **LONG** duration puts. Looking to catch that cycle when the company drops 50% on the bad news. If it goes up between now and then I'll just buy MORE puts. 

**NOT A PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL PERSON - INVEST AT YOUR OWN RISK - I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE BUT I MAY BE 🤪🤪🤪🤪 PERSON WHO EATS 💩 FOR ALL YOU KNOW**

details

**ViaSat - How it started**

Market cap of 3.26 Billion, share price of $47.55 when I'm writing this. It got as high as the 90's before the pandemic book the shins out of the market and dropped it to $28. Since recovered a bit to... as I said $47.55

They have some satellites in space that allow people with a receiver dish to get internet from space like some kind of awesome scifi movie.... except the internet is crazy expensive for what you get. Their satellites are pretty high up and that means each one can cover a BIG area. They only seem to have a handful, maybe a dozen? But they offer pretty broad coverage and are expanding it. BUT because the satellites are high up the latency (time between your computer and your internet source or something like that) is high leading to slow speeds and overall not a great service.

They already have airlines as customers, expanding recently with Delta. Their is VERY LITTLE competition in this business and between airlines, cruise lines and rural home owners with no other option they make a nice amount of money. Totally solid business model. Internet is ever more and more important and usage on air planes and boats is only gonna go up. In fact like a lot of articles on VSAT I would probably say this is a good medium / long term buy and that is why the median price target is $67 ***EXCEPT*** I know something that the market doesn't seem to have realized yet.

>EDITED BASED ON COMMENTS  
>  
>ViaSat does have commercial business beyond airlines and cruises; I would imagine rural businesses and some VERY LARGE corporations that use it for specific use cases. There is also the DOD which they have contracts with.  
>  
>  
>  
>**I AM NOT ASSERTING THAT VIA SAT WILL GO COMPLETELY OUT OF BUSINESS.**  
>  
>  
>  
>However, while a viable company may exist beyond the coming reckoning I expect the market to react extremely negatively to ViaSat losing **ALL** of their rural residential and rural small and medium size business customers. I'm also thinking that right around the time that starts sinking in news stories about cruise lines and air lines switching over to StarLink will start popping up and again, $VSAT go **💩.** I honestly hope VSAT does go up to the current target of the mid $60's because I'll start buying puts a small chunk at a time as it rises. Until then I'm waiting till August, right before next quarterly earnings report to start my position.

**StarLink - How it's going**

as you may the Dogefather happens to have a small 🚀 company. Its called SpaceX and they aren't publicly traded. They also are doing to the aerospace / orbit supply and transport industry what many of us wish Tesla could fully due to the fossil fuel industry. SpaceX's Falcon9 🚀 is all sorts of amazing - mainly because it isn't thrown out after each use ($40MM in savings for each subsequent use of a booster).

StarLink is a division of SpaceX that is focused on bringing internet to the whole 🌎 using a crazy amount of satellites. Like... A LOT. Unlike ViaSat which has a few the StarLink constellation (thats what they call a network of satellites) has 16 HUNDRED and they are launching 60 at a time every week or so (sometimes more than once a week). Because StarLink has access to this game changing super cheap 🚀 transportation AND Musk is doing is usual weirdness by mass producing these satellites and focusing on cost and volume instead of making them SUPER DUPER reliable

Some of you may remember how TSLA was this tiny company that was prob gonna die etc. etc. and THEN 💥💥 there are Model 3's and Model Y's EVERYWHERE. Well StarLink is gonna have that moment soon. Sometime in the next few months there will suddenly be high-ish speed internet (between 50mbs and 100mbs) literally ANYWHERE on the planet for $500 down and $100 a month.

Performance can only be measured through the entire cycle.    The entire Cycle exposes you from all angles. 

The human brain tends to become infected with greed at the end of a big Stage 2 run (see digital  virtuals  for current example) thus causing people to lose money after a bull market because they expect it to go on forever.

  Understanding Stage Analysis can help you overcome this

So now let's  dig in our today's post and my targets  : 

1-  Silver will enjoy huge capital flows from those digital assets  holders in a time after overcame and understand stage analysis .... who will now seek the silver whale! 

&#x200B;

2- We are in stage 2 for silver  !!! We can expect parabolic moves any time .  

 Opportunity of buying silver cheap and timely is about to end. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  ( gold did it 2020 July ) 

So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN?  

Tic Toc !

&#x200B;

3-  Silver is in a position of strength. US Dollar is in a position of weakness. 

 The final 15% decline in the US Dollar index WILL send silver parabolic!

&#x200B;

4-  The ""silver"" macro tidal wave is picking up steam &will crush all price suppression along the way...  Q2 close will set the stage how fast the insanity picks up.  HOLD ON TIGHT! Easy 56$ and 120$ targets

2208,2021-05-26,wallstreetbets,"CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Wednesday he’s not sure why any investors are still betting against GameStop and AMC Entertainment, two of the so-called meme stocks popular on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum.
.
.
The “Mad Money” host made his comments following a session in which GameStop shares rose almost 16% Wednesday and AMC advanced 19%. The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.
.
.
“Anyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,” Cramer said.
.
.
Despite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC — which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming — is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.
.
.
But Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.
.
.
Shorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.
.
.
When the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.
.
.
Both GameStop and AMC have over 20% of their float shares sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. That’s compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock.
.
“I’ve never seen anything like this: a group of buyers with no sensitivity to price,” Cramer said. “These people don’t have unlimited firepower, but they’ve got enough firepower to engineer a short-squeeze any time a bunch of professionals decide to bet against this thing.”
.

2215,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"I had my fair share of losing money, trading capital drawdowns, busting my own trading capital many times before finally learning from past mistakes to become a better trader and stop do stuff like it's a mf casino.

I don’t want to share with you something that you all heard so many times (yep, I haven't lost my fate in humanity) like avoid margin trading or invest in mutual funds. I believe I have some wisdom I wish I had from the beginning.

1. Trading is just 5% theory and 95% about emotional control, risk and money management, overcoming one’s greed, having strict stoploss and targets predefined before taking a trade.
2. Don’t follow advice from forums blindly. Build your own map of the world. Each of us learn to trade at our own pace and don’t get discouraged if you find that after a few years, you’re still struggling to master the ‘money game’. You can keep in mind different advice from experienced players (e.g. I recommend this qooore app and it's discord community), *but it's vital for the final decision to be yours*.
3. Accept losses and do not make investment decisions based on emotion Especially greed, fear, or panic. Yep, you didn’t buy Betcoin (lol couldn't resist) at 3,000$ because you didn’t know back than what direction the price would take. No regrets. Keep yourself focused on here and now, move ahead
4. Know yourself. What is your current financial situation? Why you are investing? For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully.
5. Never forget that for investing, time is your best friend - and greed is your worst enemy. Patience is a requirement in stock trading. There are no short-cuts or ‘holy grail’ when it comes to stock. And you only need to have couple of strategies but those should be well tested and made perfect over the period of time.

To me, trading is a skill that requires 3Ls - ‘Life-Long Learning”.

Stay humble, be honest and willing to admit your mistakes in trading and don’t try to rationalise and explain mistakes away, and always remain teachable and never think you’ve ‘arrived’.",nlvay0,[],0

2217,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"Hi Everyone! I did some research on cinema stocks a while back and made a video on it. I didn't post the content here so I thought I would share it as I know everyone is interested in AMC at the moment! I know it's a lot to read so if you prefer to watch the video, the link for that is also included below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s)

Why Cinema Stocks like AMC will benefit from reopening? 

Time-Frame: Cinema’s will benefit from reopening and the economic recovery that is occurring all over the world. Especially over a longer timeframe.  I think that Cinemas can be a good trade in the medium term and can help you make money. It’s all dependent on data and how quickly things go back to normal, but my timeframe on this trade right now is 1-2 years. Maybe even shorter, perhaps 6 months if we bounce back very quickly. Maybe not the most likely, but still a possible scenario that I have to consider. 

&#x200B;

Thesis: 

1)  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a very strong negative impact on the cinema sector. So, naturally as things reopen and vaccinations increase all over North America, these companies stand to benefit. If we look back from the end of January 2020 to the end of April 2021, Marcus Corporation was down approximately 33% from January 27th, 2020. Cinemark is down approximately 35% over the same time period, while National CineMedia is down almost 42% and AMC is up almost 57%. Price is an important factor to consider when buying and selling stocks and this something that is important to consider 

2) Cinemas have suffered tremendously with the Covid-19 pandemic, which makes the cinema sector intriguing as the world re-opens. If we look to Asia, especially China and Japan, where Covid-19 cases subsided and theatres reopened, things look promising.  There was a substantial increase in demand, with demand actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. In China, December 2020 ticket sales at IMAX’s big-screen theatres jumped 28 per cent from a year earlier, while in Japan, they broke daily records and a record number of people saw movies on the first weekend of January 2021. Clearly, there was a lot of pent-up demand which surfaced and benefitted movie theatres in Asia. 

3) And you know what I’ve seen this film before. Last year early in February, there was a sudden spike in downloads of the Zoom app in China, and the stock at that was point already doing well, up roughly 30 percent from the start of the year. But this spike in Zoom usage soon spread all over the world, and the rest is history. It was an absolutely humungous winner last year. There are obviously sector wide risks with consumer preferences changing, and more and more people preferring to watch films at home. The increase in Netflix & streaming service subscribers over the years is a clear indication of consumer preferences going-forward, but I do like movie theatres as a trade. There is a lot of pent-up demand that I feel will benefit the sector. 

Risks: 

\-  One of the main risks that that most people who are considering trading or investing in cinema companies have, is the risk from Netflix and the other streaming services. Really the risk of the Direct-to-consumer approach and the effects that it will have on the cinema companies. And this is a valid concern because it has reduced demand for cinemas over the last decade. Even some of the biggest filmmakers in the world are turning to it, like Martin Scorsese, Noah Baumbach and Alfonso Cuaron.  Netflix has become the biggest movie studio in the world, at-least when it comes to volume in terms of production over the last several years. And now they plan to release 50-60 films per year, and with their pioneering Direct to Consumer approach, the film industry has changed. Cinemas are no longer at the forefront, and the Direct-to-Consumer strategy is quickly becoming the new incumbent. The DTC approach is taking over, with all the streaming services that have launched. They have taken market share from linear television and have steered consumers away from traditional Cinema.

Catalysts & Conclusion: 

1) However, I still think there is still a place for theatres, even with streaming, especially looking at the same timeframe that I’m focusing on for this trade. I think now more so than ever people want to be outside. These businesses will benefit from the change in near term consumer trends, with everyone wanting to leave the house. I really believe that the cinema sector is going to do well in North America. If Asia is anything to go by and I think it is, some of the companies involved in the sector have the potential to be great trades. People still want to go to the cinemas, especially when it comes to seeing some of the big budget films that are really made for the big screen. Blockbuster action films with awesome effects are really meant to be seen in a movie theatre in my opinion. The effects and the environment simply cannot be replicated at home. Especially when it comes to immersive experience films, like those with IMAX and 4DX. I really enjoy the cinema and think there is something to be said for being in a big space in a dark room watching a film 40 feet across. It is wonderful to sit in the comfort of your own home but there is just something to be said for having a community experience in a room. But that’s neither there nor here. 

  
2) Moving on, another potential catalyst is the potential for collaboration between theatre chains and streaming services. Netflix was the one to pioneer the Direct to Consumer, but interestingly they have begun releasing some Netflix Originals on the big screen in recent years. Films like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes all premiered in Cinemas prior to their appearance in Netflix’s online catalogue.  This is a really interesting move on their part, especially from an investment perspective. Because, while you can watch streaming services in the comfort of your own home, movie theatre companies are open to the idea of having the films that are produced by the streaming services shown in their theatres. Cinemark has shown Netflix movies in theatres in the past, and there is an off chance that they expand their agreement. This wouldn’t just apply to Cinemark but other theatre chains as well potentially. The big hold-up between the streaming services and theatre chains was the disagreement on the length of theatrical window. But last year, Universal Studios and Cinemark, AMC & Cineplex agreed to a shortened exclusive window, from 74 days to 31 days for major films, as defined by box-office domestic revenue. This makes it more likely that Netflix and other streaming services can find middle ground with the cinema companies. It’s not all that important a catalyst for the trade, nor is it all that likely, but it is still intriguing and something to consider.

3) A more important catalyst is the release of the next James Bond film, no time to die next year. I’m really excited about the movie because I’m a huge James Bond fan. It’s probably my favourite movie series. And you know what, I’m not alone. It’s very popular all over the world. The previous James Bond film, Spectre, grossed nearly $879 million. No Time To Die has been postponed several times due to the pandemic and is due to premiere on October 8th in the United States. I’m really excited about the movie and will be sure to see in theatres provided it’s safe to do so. And I think it will be. This movie is really important for the movie theatres because they have been starved and there have just been very few films to show. They have been supply constrained with the lack of new films. No Time To Die is a certain blockbuster and will really help benefit the sector. 

4) Something else that has me really excited is the recent CDC news in the US, with them updating guidance on April 2nd that fully vaccinated people can travel internationally safely and don’t need to quarantine when they return provided, they test negative within three to five days of their return. They have to test negative before they are allowed to board a return flight to the US. This is really exciting, and this combined with the idea of a vaccine passport as has been proposed by cruise lines and the UK government really provide a lot of momentum for the cinema companies.

2218,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"I will try to keep this short and sweet.
In my view the following points are justifiable:
-The VW emissions hack was not an effort to destroy the environment. 
-It was trolling done by VW officials bc they were tired of having the EPA’s pozzed dick in their asses regarding diesel emission regulations on diesel imports. 
-VW was tired of the EPA because:

     A.  In europe diesel autos make up over half of    
           all car engines. 
     B.  Cars like the Euro-version VW golf wagon      
           get almost 90 mpg. Compare that to the 
           Toyota Prius that gets 40mpg at best. 
     C.  The EPA doesnt want VW to import a 90    
           MPG diesel car to the US because it would    
           kill US auto sales, so the EPA makes diesel 
           regulations so strict that the only diesels 
           VW et. al. can import only manage 45 MPG. 
     D.  And if you want to make things fair, the 
           highest MPG diesel electric hybrid made by 
           VW gets over 200 MPG. 
     E.  Europeans aren’t idiots: they aren’t willingly 
          “poisoning themselves” with diesel fumes. 
          Diesel is just as clean as gas and burning 
          1 gallon of diesel fuel every 90 miles is 
          better for the environment than burning 1 
          gallon of gas every 30 miles. 
     F.  The “smelly/black fume producing” 
          reputation of diesel in america owes itself to 
          idiot US auto makers that in the 80’s tried to 
          make frankenstein diesel engines out of 
          modified gas engines and they ran like shit 
          and spewed black smoke. These atrocities    
          were unlike the clean running diesel engines 
          that were being produced in Germany at the 
          same time. 
-In summary, the EPA has been punishing European Auto makers (VW) for American auto makers’ past engineering disgraces, and when VW officials got tired of being unfairly punished they decided to troll the EPA with an emissions hack. 
-They did it to slam some jimmies, not to gain      
profit or destroy the environment. 
-German authorities know this, which is why they released key players like Oliver Schmidt who was let out on parole right after he was transferred from US prison to German authorities. 
-The loss of stock value that occured from the scandal was unjustified then, and the stagnation of VW stock price since then has been unjustified in light of the fact that VW’s P/E in the last 3 months has been between 50-70 times lower than that of Tesla, and historically it has been foolish to underestimate the ability of Volkswagen to perform at the cutting edge of the industry. 
-The Emissions hack has nothing negative to say about Volkswagens fierce engineering capability and in my view it has something positive to say about the youthfulness and creativity of the company.

Retail shorts have hopped on the bandwagon and when stocks move they tend to over shoot the upside and the downside. 

Sundial has over $1 billion in cash, no debt, positive operating profit, and many valuable passive investments. 

The manipulation that the stock received was absolutely insane. Institutional ownership was less than 2% when SNDL made it’s run in Feb and the big boys didn’t want to miss the party and they paid motley fool to write bash articles while they accumulate their position. This is just my assumption, which is never a good thing when valuing stocks, but as a former stock analyst I would bet that institutional ownership will be over 5% very soon and then 10%.

2228,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic has two revenue streams.

1. Commercial Passenger Flights:

They expect to fly 25 commercial flights in 2022, with six passengers each, which means 150 passengers for 2022.

Ticket cost is around $250k, which translates into revenues of approximately $37.5 million from Commercial Passengers in 2022

2. Additional Revenue:

Besides commercial passengers, the company has also generated some revenue by carrying payloads into space in recent years. Assuming that this will grow to about $12 million by 2022, total revenues would stand at $50 million for the year.

3) Revenue Per Share

Revenue Per Share is likely to grow to about $0.21 in 2022, assuming total shares outstanding of 234 million.

4. Value Per Share

With a sales multiple of about 70 (contains a certain amount of goodwill), it translates into a stock price of about  $15 per Share.

**Shorting $GLD**

$GLD mostly follows real rates and then the $. 

What has allowed $GLD to prosper recently has been :

a) Ever dovish FED decreasing nominal rates as much as they can via their speeches & slower than expected job gains which have cemented FED forecasts

b) Ever rising inflation expectations due to faulty base effects that are transitory

c) Some impact from Crapto crash with money flowing back into $GLD (some of it at least :/)

I think there has been a gestalt shift on all three items 

a) FED's Clarida & Quarles yesterday have both suggested the beginning of tapering discussions 

> Late yesterday, the Fed’s Quarles said “it will become important for the FOMC to begin discussing our plans to adjust the pace of asset purchases at upcoming meetings.” Quarles is the Fed’s Vice Chair for Supervision and it is unusual for him to comment on monetary policy.

aBis) The NFP last month was a serious miss but it's not gonna be repeated : as schools reopen and UIs are not extended in a lot of states, the slaves will go back to finding a slave master before jobs run out. employers have also adjusted somewhat with regards to wage expectations already which should make for a much more balanced jobs market going into the begining of school season

b) Inflation (in CPI sense) has peaked in April or will peak now, Commos have crashed thanks to our lords and saviors, the ccp tightening margins and putting an end to this story. 

c) Crapto stabilized

What a day yesterday, but as expected per my last DD. The question now is since MVIS is sub $15 - will the downward movement continue or will the stock stagnate around $15 for awhile?

Looking at the usual metrics, the only thing that can significantly answer this question is the placement of options for now. This is because:

https://preview.redd.it/61qdor9stn171.png?width=2228&format=png&auto=webp&s=01556f96df70c1f4293f70b4f707763e2594640d

There is reasonable protection from dealer gamma - but this can be a double-edged sword if it rises too quickly too much. But in this case, a marginal decrease with a significant price drop is a relatively good sign .

The price, despite its drop, ended about where it was expected to (at the lower band of expectation):

The options landscape hasn't changed that much, relatively speaking. The price moved down below the largest chunk of calls at $15, again as expected.

So in attempting to divine the future, one must ask: are there any forces at play that are more significant than the others? The answer: currently - no, but the cliff is near.

Take a peak at these metrics:

https://preview.redd.it/022b4ildun171.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=3895f4fb62252b9f4e3b9a2a9949f025598675fe

These are the number of shares (assuming all dealer intermediary) that must be bought or sold per combination of price / IV increase.

MVIS is in the uncomfortable position where *any increase in IV will result in selling*. This is unusual and slightly unhealthy. 

So MVIS seems entirely contingent currently on liquidity: if it remains low, then it will probably waiver around $15 until big upstream moves are made. If IV begins to rise, than a cycle of selling could be initiated. Per the options, if this happens, the only 'floor' of sorts would be around $10 with the \~18k Puts.

Keep an eye on volatility!",nm6vg7,[],1

LinkedIn is the biggest and baddest in the social networking professional space. Too bad $MSFT saw this years ago and decided to buy them, so knowing the true value is pretty hard. That being said, they're not the only fish in the sea, and yesterday one of those fish went public.

ZipRecruiting $ZIP IPOd yesterday, and unlike $COIN didn't immediately shit the bed. It actually went up, weird right? Anyways, everyone and their dog is going to be looking for jobs now that covid is over and the stimulus checks dry up, so calls on $ZIP as their revenue shoots to the mooooooonnnn, especially after you all lose your ass on GME and AMC and even wendys wont hire you, so youll need to use these guys to find a job

Morning everyone. This post is by no way detailed with statistics or a deep dive into the company, this is just something I have been watching over the past 6 months as a very active social media user. Draftkings has 3-4 active Twitter accounts. The main one of coarse being simply @ Draftkings with 320K folowers (@ Fanduel only has 254k but who is keeping score) . Anyway, as Draftkings rolls out new programs like Sports Betting (@ DKSportsbook) or Casino (@ DKCasino) and you can get a pretty good idea of what the company will be doing or acting like by simply scrolling down their feed.

Well if you have a minute, I suggest you scroll down the Twitter feed of @ DKCasino. They only have 200 posts or so since they are relatively new but you can see that when they started posting late last year, and literally only being live in a handful of states, they had free money promotions with almost no interaction. But now, especially the past month or so, you will notice every one of their tweets is now 

1) a direct advertisement of one of their games that you can currently play

2)a sign up promotion 

3) interactions with a player who has won money. 

4) starting to have 30+ comments on every tweet. 

I think #3 is the key to the future. When investing in Draftkings everyone including myself constantly thinks ""Sports betting"" which we can all agree is a young mans/woman's game. Very few, including myself, have realized that Draftkings will be using all its power of brand name, player connection and social media to delivery a full LEGAL casino to your iPhone. The last sentence is simply fact, as I stated @ Draftkings twitter account has 320K followers, the @ DKCasino only has..... 2607 followers. YUP, thats IT, only TWO THOUSAND followers so far. I think this is a huge reason institutional investors like Blackrock or ARK are going in head first. They are buying a fully legal casino delivered to your door. You know those busses they run out of retirement homes into Casinos and back 3 times a week? Well why on earth would those old people spend hours on busses when the future of Casinos is a Draftkings app on a 24 inch Ipad screen in their rooms? 

Now you say "" Hey buddy, what does Draftkings know about casinos when they will be competing with PENN or MGM or WYNN. And in a sense you are right. But for a second, lets look at that retirement home scenario. Draftkings has NO brick and mortar casinos. Unlike PENN or MGM. Who benefits more from your grandmother NOT taking the free shuttle bus to the brick Casino, PENN/MGM who make money either way, or Draftkings who spends 0.0 $ on storefronts, employees, and every penny that Grandma spends playing in her room is 100% PURE profit taken away from PENN or MGM. 

Everyone keeps focusing on the amount of money Draftkings has spent on customer acquisition lately. That is the reason the stock price is down. Well if you think of them acquiring future Casino customers that they are taking away from PENN, MGM and WYNN. It makes more sense of why they are spending so hard.",nm7muv,[],0

I really really like the setup on this one as it's broken out of the weekly downward trend line and has found support over 15 a share. I bought options that go until Jan of 2022 to hopefully give me enough time for the weed stock hype to come back before the spring legislative session of 2022 in which I expect Congress to pass their federal legalization bill. I could get lucky and it might be introduced this summer which would be ideal. But even if not the chart and price action suggests to me that $20 a share is completely possible even without legislative catalyst.

2256,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"Look at the short interest, GME was listed at 17% - AMC was 21% 

UWMC is now 22% + with 100% borrow fees

Did you know TODAY it was added to the MSCI index !? Major bullish catalyst 

In about 10 days it goes EX DIV, which means shorts have to PAY that dividend if they don’t cover. Also, Russell index inclusion will be announced at the same time. 

AMC and GME both are selling hundreds of millions of dollars in stock / UWMC is BUYING hundreds of millions of dollars in stock. Yes CEO announced a buy back that could eliminate 44% of the float ($300M)


Did I mention while you wait for a squeeze to the moon you collect about a 5% dividend? 


Options - look at the options ! Not only is there an insane amount of Open Interest, but there is no premium in the calls. You can buy $5 calls all the way out to DEC within 5 cents of current stock price.  Meaning you can go big and buy time, for almost zero premium. 

This is the real play. If UWMC had 1/10 of the volume AMC did yesterday it would have MOONED. It can happen. 🚀💸

This is not financial advice, but it could be a good time to take some gains and actually put them to good use !!
