Over the past 10+ years, interest rates have been at all-time low. This disproportionately helps tech growth and high-debt companies (note the overlap there). As interest rates (almost inevitably) rise, these stocks are not expected to perform as well. 

Like you said, tech/IT is more volatile. In a market decline, especially a sustained one, tech companies will struggle more than the broad economy. 

These are really the only two things that “refute” your thinking that I could think of. With that being said, I’m on your said. I too am young and have a long time horizon, so I am (partly) in etfs with significant expense ratios and with significant volatility. Just make sure you understand the risks.

reversion is a little more complicated, but basically it involves the unit of account being more important than common stock as a store of value.

That fatest tail increase period in inflation matched the fatest tail upside in gold. Now there is not enough data to go further but if you are worried about dramatic US inflation I'm sure gold will do ok.

Kind of like puts. Are far OTM puts really a hedge? They are more correlated but if SP500 goes down just a bit then they won't pay off (because you hold for a far tail event).

Maybe I should say this: gold correlation with inflation isn't great but is a great tail hedge (based on 1 data point lol 1970-1980). So if you care about tail hedges the most (more extreme inflation) then gold is a good hedge. 

I think 1980-1990 is hard to say. I think when the hedge paid off so much, it was overbought and then you have periods of underperformance.

Also note that in 1970-1980 CPI was accelerating (which means you have more worries about it going out of control) and 1980-1990 it was decelerating CPI (so although high inflation rate it was going down). So difference is 1970-1980 worries were out of control inflation where as 1980-1990 inflation seems to be ok now so let's get these fat bond yields.

&#x200B;

So I agree that correlation isn't great, but a fat tailed version of correlation (which you would probably want out of a tail hedge) could be good. Also this makes sense from first principles that for a fat tailed inflation event gold would be great because everyone would be freaking out. Would also be interesting to look at acceleration of CPI vs gold returns.

You can kind of look at paying off those loans as making an investment with a guaranteed 12.5% return with 0 risk. (Not exactly how the math works, but close enough). US stock market has done about 10% on average, and there's a fair amount of risk - so paying off your loans is really good.

3. After that, I'd just save up for the car down payment, and pay off the loan on the typical schedule. Most auto loan rates are pretty low - so there's not a great reason to pay those off early.

The mechanism is essentially that the Fed gives new dollars to the government, which then chooses the segment of the population deserving of these dollars while everyone else who is not on the government's good side pays for it. That mechanism doesn't work that well if there is a storage of value that cannot be deflated, and the segment of the population that receives the new money has to pay for goods with that storage of value not controlled by the government.

182,gys4aec,2021-05-20,t3_ngnide,investing,"In general, if two mutual funds are equal, the fund with the lower expense ratio should outperform the one with the higher expense ratio on a net of fees basis. E.g.  an S&P 500 fund with a 0.015% ER should slightly outperform an S&P 500 fund with a 0.04% ER.

In practice, that may not always be the case with index funds because of tracking error.

Also, in reality, I'd argue that there's not going to be a whole lot of long-term difference between same/similar mutual funds where the ER is under 0.25%, and especially if they have ERs under 0.10%. Maybe some minimal difference in net of fees return, but nothing that will really make or break you even compounding over decades.

I wouldn't say you're necessarily missing anything, per se. There will always be mutual funds with high(er) ERs that outperform funds with low(er) ERs. Whether they can maintain that outperformance over long stretches of time (e.g. 20-30+ years) is the key question, and obviously not answerable without hindsight.

But, I would say that with the two you're using in your comparison, they're not really comparable. You're comparing a fund that holds 500 of the largest companies across all industries and sectors to a fund that has 70 holdings focused in technology, which has had a strong run over the last several years. So, it's not an apples to apples in this case.

TL/DR: funds with lower expenses will tend to outperform same/similar funds with higher expenses over time. Over certain periods of time, there will inevitably be funds with high(er) expenses that outperform funds with low(er) expenses.",[],0

As in, I expect the USD to inflate 2% each year, devaluing the currency and decreasing my purchasing power, so if I put it into BTC that is (disregarding the volatility) increasing in value each year, \*increasing\* your purchasing power than it is deflationary. You could store your money in it to hedge against the inflation over time of a trusted currency. 

&#x200B;

While transferring cash from one currency to another during crisis levels of inflation such as in Venezuela is somewhat hedging for inflation it's not exactly what they're talking about when using those terms. At least that's what I'm assuming they're talking about.

&#x200B;

What the thread is arguing though is that even though bitcoin has a wild 1, 3, 5, and 10 year yield, this is not hedging for inflation, its actually just a bubble forming around an asset that has no underlying value and the bubble will burst, unlike say the price of gold which... doesn't seem to ever fall out of favor.

272,gys9ty7,2021-05-20,t3_ngamt2,investing,"I'm not holding bitcoin, but I think your analysis way too subjective.

* bitcoin has finite supply and that's the main reason it was called assets that protect against inflation. The reason for its price volatility is because currently it's used more as speculation and not massively used as currency on daily lives . When it can be used as proper currency (where a lot of shop globally accept it as payment) then it will be a true assets that protect against inflation. Even gold value had go down massively and anyone doesn't argue that it's an asset to protect against inflation, the difference is bitcoin is way easier to trade and not manipulated by bank that's why it has more fluctuation.
* bitcoin is long term investment, because currently its use is immature. However many countries especially one with hyperinflation made the people turn to bitcoin/cryptocurrency. US Dollar will also go down the same route because it has repeated many times in history that the kind of current policy that the FED currently takes will hurt in the long run and accelerate inflation. US Dollar will not be getting killed by other traditional currency but it will be killed by commodities price, assets price, and some solid and massively used cryptocurrency which is translate as inflation. And as history goes the devaluation of US Dollar buying power is true  and continue to happen in the last few decades especially if we compare it with assets like housing, more so if we compare it with bitcoin in the last 10 year.
* As far as I know, the inflation shows mainly in commodities because the demand still large and the supply chain has problem. As for money printing is going to stock market (even I predict the stimulus go to stock or meme coin because of young investor without proper research). For the daily lives necessity demand doesn't go up much (in my country it seems to go down), but somehow the money velocity massively down which supposed to mean less transaction in actual market. If we believe the data then when economy rebound, the daily lives necessity product demand will rise and the price will also rise, since supply chain problem will not be easily fixed while too much money flow to the market. 
* My current opinion of US market is the FED trying to pump economy but avoid inflation by mainly pump money on the stock. This way the money got mainly into the rich and not the real market (the reason of growing inequality), it will not show real inflation effect immediately especially since the rich tend to hold their investment and buy more investment than spend in real market. This is also the reason for assets bubble especially the tech sector since their valuation are not backed by hard assets but by revenue growth. When the money flow to real market and the tech sector cannot justify their valuation with their revenue, this could made the bubble burst.
* Anyway, I only invest few buck on crypto and doesn't really like bitcoin since for me its use case as currency has failed because with high price the transaction fee is high too. So even if it has high probability to go higher (since it's the grandfather of crypto), I will not invest on it.",[],0

333,gyse8l1,2021-05-20,t3_ng0np6,investing,"Profitability certainly isn't a one way road. If you ask pretty much any profitable trader on their journey, you'd be met by how much money they've  burnt for the sake of learning how to trade; and how you should place special emphasis on planning your positions. Conventional and generic as it may sound, trading the most liquid market on the field of investments actually needs a lot of attention to detail and groundwork.  
With so, throughout my experience and journey in the forex market, here is my checklist before I enter a trade.

  
**1. KNOW YOUR BROKER.**  Yes, you've read that right. Knowing your broker can have a factor on your win rate. You have to know how much spread and leverage they offer--given so, it will help you determine whether your type of trading (Scalping, Swing, or Day Trading) would suit their services. For this, I use Fazzaco.com. They provide in-depth analyses on different FX Brokers. From trust ratings to news and economic datas , they have it all.  
**2. KEEP TRACK OF YOUR TRADES.** Jot down your performance. Treat trading like a competitive online game. As much as possible, you would want to be one of the bests--having high win rates and a good stat sheet is one of our goals. To do that, you must be self-aware of your trading history. Trading is more than just making money. Part of it is also keeping records. I highly suggest using myforexbook for currency traders  
**3. CHECK THE FUNDAMENTALS.** Technical Analysis is one thing--personally, I use TA to find the best position to enter a trade. But other than that, my bias would entirely depend on the economic situation and datas the currency has to offer. Again, NEVER NEGLECT YOUR FUNDAMENTALS.  
**4. TRUST YOUR ANALYSIS.** One of the many reasons why most traders fail is the tendency to switch bias while in a middle of a trade. Although some harbor success  on these methods, it isn't exactly for everyone. Stick to your plan. Remember, there are only two outcomes in trading. Either you win, or you lose. There is no middle ground.  
**5. HAVE A GROWTH PLAN.** Think long-term. If you want to find success in the career of trading, set ideal objectives. It is essential to have daily, weekly, and monthly goals.  
Always remember that rules are what distinguishes viability from seasonality. A good trader is built step after step.  Hope you guys find this post useful.",[],1

Unfortunately, I doubt broker A adjusted my cost basis for wash sales (or rather, I cannot find any evidence that they perform adjustments) before the transfer to broker B. I could probably figure this out if I looked through the monthly statements, but at some point I just CBA.

There are four variations of DCF depending on the characteristics of a particular stock, such as industry and data availability:



* 2-Stage Discounted Cash Flow Model: suitable for companies that do not necessarily grow at a constant rate over time. They tend to be high-growth initially, and become stable after a couple of years.
* Dividend Discount Model (DDM): accurate for companies that consistently pays out a meaningful portion of their earnings as dividends.
* Excess Returns Model: used for financial companies such as banks and insurance, generally do not have a significant proportion of physical assets, and face different regulatory requirements for cash holdings.

509,gysrslz,2021-05-20,t1_gyq7s8v,investing,"So just in my observation over the last few years here's where the whole gold analogue thing came from.  Initially crypto kind of got it's initial momentum from two crowds.  One was tech enthusiasts who throught it was cool and liked being able to mine it on their home computer early on.  The other big one was the anti-bank crowd that was way more prominent after 2008, that's kind of evolved into the whole DeFi movement where it's not so much a matter of hard currency as it is having some kind of financial system independent of traditional intermediaries like banks.

Still you didn't have many comparisons to gold, the whole idea was still to actually replace dollars and banks for the longest time.

What really got the whole argument about it being a gold analogue or inflation  protection kicked off in the last few years when it become increasingly clear that the energy consumption and efficiency of proof of work coins was awful from an environmental standpoint and that the overall volatility and lack of supporting infrastructure really made using it as an actual currency impractical.  Suddenly everyone needed some other environmentally terrible business to compare it against.  That's where gold came in.  Gold extract is terrible and energy intensive too so crypto mining could compare favorably.  Commodities are also more volatile so that was less of a problem.  

It's basically all marketing and always has been.  In general crypto has also shifted heavily from a batch of true believers to people looking for a low effort way to get rich quick.  There's no real philisophical underpinning to a lot of it anymore and the lack of regulation has made it a breeding ground for money laundering, scams and over manipulation.

Stock futures are pointing to a lower open again. As of 0620 the Nasdaq, Dow, S&P all down about 0.5%. If you’re keeping score, this sets us up for a fourth straight day of losses

Difficult to see right now where a catalyst will come from for a reversal. We do have initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations there is for about 450k new claims, slightly lower than the 473k we had last week, which was a post-pandemic low. If the number comes in well below forecasts it could help sentiment.

Newbie here to investing - meant to start for a while however never got round to it. I’m 27, planning to go for long term. I’m in UK. 
My idea is to start with monthly £100 invested into an index like FTSE 100 or 250. Here’s the question which one you think would be better? 

Currently I’m only having some of the stocks from company I work for as part of employee share buying scheme (get it at 20% discount, signing up for either 3 or 5 years contract). This year it expires , and I’ll probably take out the money (partially because want to buy a house in next couple years) and also planning on putting £5k into investing from that.

currently being investigated by NYAG and in the process:

- Having all of tether's money in their lawyer's personal bank account (May 2017)

- Not having any bank account anywhere in the world for 6 monthsto receive money in. Yet still emitting $400m new tethers in that period. Their lawyer's personal account had, at most, $60m at any point. Bitfinex had two institutional deposits in that whole period, neither of whom purchased USDT.

- Failing to complete an audit and settling on an attestation (An audit verifies where money comes from. An attestation is just an accoutnant saying ""there was money in a bank account on that date"") for ""transparency"". The morning of the attestation, tether moved $380m from sister company bitfinex into a bank account the morning of the day of the attestation.

- Losing $900M to their money launderer, and covering those losses by commingling bitfinex customer funds with tether reserve funds (2018)

- Finding the last bank on earth, Deltec Bank from Bahamas willing to do business with them after Wells Fargo and HSBC fired them as clients. Remember HSBC has the kind of risk tolerance leaving them to willingly deals with drug cartels. No bank wants tether as a client.

- Almost all of the reserves are in some form of loan to a commercial company (corporate bonds, commercial paper, secured loans). Only around 5% are in assets whose value we know (cash, T-Bills).

I think in terms of the above, I think you've had a decade+ where growth (and tech in particular) was the primary discussion, the only game in town, etc etc.  I'm a little concerned that perhaps that era of easy growth investing is over and last year's insane performance of aggressive growth was perhaps sort of a ""grand finale.""

That's not saying no growth, that's not saying no tech. It's just that the portfolio that people often have posted on here over the last half decade that basically resembles a tech fund or aggressive growth fund hasn't worked this year and may be bumpier going forward for a while.

Personally, I'd say have a very diversified portfolio (and perhaps that's index + some minor active or other variation) and if you are going to have an actively managed growth fund I'd suggest consideration of a more broadly diversified one, such as Baron Global Advantage (BGAFX, which is a very good, broad global aggressive growth fund) or others - but an aggressive growth fund like that would be a reasonable % of the portfolio.",[],1

Why? Miners (or rather, the computers that make up the network pool) are free to leave the network. While incredibly unlikely, it is theoretically possible to wake up tomorrow and find that all existing miners have freely decided to leave the mining pools. If that happens, not only does it become very difficult to execute transactions, the entire network becomes vulnerable to devaluation or illegitimate coins in the form of a 51% attack. 

Now imagine a smaller, less extreme version of this scenario happening over a longer period of time. If other cryptocurrencies (or other uses for compute power in general) become more lucrative to mine, people will transfer their compute resources there.

800,gytcqgw,2021-05-20,t3_nfy23l,investing,"Buy gold, and a farm somewhere.. Really any asset that you can hold in your hand that will increase in value. That's your hedge against hyperinflation.. But if the US hits 15-20% inflation let alone 4k%.. We are all screwed.. Know how to grow your own food is a skill that is worth having cause once fuel hits 3000$ p/g and meat is 20k for a steak.. Sitting back tending to your field while everything goes to shit.. Will be worth it.

But tbh what's the chances this happens we have an election in 2 years and then another presidential election 2 years after that.. Interest rates are still crazy low and the economy is for the most part still shut down.. Do you think any government would want to send us into hyperinflation and what's the chances they could before we toss em out of power.

If you have been investing for a while this is exciting times.. I'm in the inflation 3-6% is going to be short term maybe till September, then it should settle down to around 2... You basically have had the whole world running on 30% for the past year.. The surge in supply thaf is going to be needed to crank the world engine upto 100% is going to be insane..",[],0

When people talk about hedges against inflation, they’re usually longer term. You want a hedge against inflation that’s long term, and a tool for capital flight is inherently only held in the short term (not hiding capital, fleeing with it). 

So while you can agree that in this particular instance it will beat inflation (the same way that a brick or a frozen potato can be used to hammer a nail) it’s not necessarily a good tool for that purpose.

916,gyto2kn,2021-05-20,t3_ngamt2,investing,"Bitcoin has inherently no value and that will become evident by the end of this decade when Quantum Computers go mainstream. There's already an algorithm developed to crack Bitcoin encryption and it's just a matter of time when the QComputers get around to 4000 Qbits to break encryption. Sure, Bitcoin can always transition to a new protocol and the users will actively need to swap coins but what happens to the lost wallets? This inherently breaks the trust in the system and leads to collapse.

An argument against this is ""You need to worry about other systems, banks, etc. when QComputers go mainstream because Bitcoin is the last of your worries."" 

Answer: Centralized systems can easily move to Quantum encryption using centralized QComputers but it takes time for Decentralized systems to move to these systems. There's a reason why some financial companies are already working on implementing/researching QComputers.

958,gytrvky,2021-05-20,t1_gytg50t,investing,"> Saying bitcoin is similar to gold is just saying that bitcoin is independent of any government backing

We could say the same about oxygen and cockroaches. 


> bitcoin has a hard fixed supply

No it doesn't, bitcoin currently promises to have a limit on the supply but that is up to what the miners want to do. The only Guarentee that bitcoin offers is that the majority (or super majority) of miners will dictate how the protocol works.


> Bitcoin is still early in discovery. Gold has a long history of use

I think what you mean is ""After 12 years we haven't come up with any good use cases to justify the valuation"". Bitcoin isn't in early discovery, we know exactly what bitcoin does and the truth is it's just worse than existing products except in a very few edge cases that most people don't care about.

> Are people literally saying Bitcoin is like Gold because it's an element with intrinsic properties that never change? No of course not!

You're right, you are saying bitcoin is like Gold just as much as it's like shit, all three things are completely independent of any government backing. So why do you use gold? seems pretty misleading doesn't it? Why don't we compare bitcoin to feces?

> Just in the same way comparing Bitcoin to TikTok and social media is equally as easy to pick apart with strawman arguments.

Well no, see bitcoin is a piece of software that operates over the internet and we should compare it to other pieces of software. 





So just to sum up your argument: **Bitcoin is independent of any government backing, which makes it similar to things like gold, oil, oxygen, cockroaches and shit, but let's focus on gold because that's a better sell**",[],0
