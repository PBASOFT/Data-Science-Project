Banks don't want to lend to the public at these dumpster interest rates. Interest rates that are this low because of the Fed's QE. Like the article says, they'd rather get dumpster returns from the Fed. At least those are risk-free.

The knock-on effects of the massively artificially inflated asset prices and forcing investors out the risk curve are much more worrisome to me. People are taking on more and more risk and the only chance of it being worth it is if the Fed never leaves the game. The market would price stocks and junk bonds much lower than they are now, but the Fed has their thumb on the scale so investors have to take outsized risks to get the same returns. If the Fed decides to stop, there's going to be a shit-ton of bag holders.

The other problem is shit like we're seeing in real estate. Investors looking for yield are pushing up prices and buy up a shit-ton of homes with it. People are buying homes sight-unseen because they're afraid of getting left behind. This is fueling the explosion in real estate *at the same time there's an unprecedented supply and building shortage*. Even worse, big investment firms are buying entire neighborhoods to turn into rental properties. Average people who would have been able to afford a home aren't able to meet the down payment requirements, much less compete with all-cash offers coming from buyers who are either cash rich because the Fed pumped their investment portfolios to unprecedented highs, or have ultra-cheap non-mortgage financing.",[],0

1592,gzdt2xd,2021-05-25,t3_nko8dk,wallstreetbets,"This chart is basically saying that the price of the GameStop stock is still accumulating with decreasing volume on the NYSE. We see the price reacting to either the Support ($140.00) or the Resistance ($190.00). From a technical perspective, there is no advantage in trading within the pattern. You will have a great Risk/Reward ratio after the price breaking out of the structure.  


There are (obviously) two possible scenarios. The current sentiment is pointing towards a bullish scenario, which can be confirmed be looking at the MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence) and the RSI (Relative Strength Index). The average price is increasing while the price is going in a sideways movement. In this case, we see buyers being active on the market without being able to spot it in the first sight.  


For a proper breakout of the horizontal channel, we want to see **increasing volume and a strong reaction at the support/resistance**. This is my personal confirmation for loading more stocks. If the price moves past the $140.00 level, i will look for a lower entry around the $100 level.",[],0

In 1979, President Jimmy Carter had appointed Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. With inflation running double digits the Federal Reserve under Volker raised the federal funds rate from 11.2% to 20% by June of 1981.The intent was to break the inflationary spiral within the United States. But raising the federal funds rate also made it more difficult to borrow money. This helped cause the 1980-1982 recession and a national unemployment rate of over 10%. As a result, the Bear Market of 1982 could be called Volker's Bear.

2879,gzdxg9l,2021-05-25,t1_gzdvkgt,wallstreetbets,"> The 450c, are you selling calls against it? Monthly .2 deltas...$430s?

I got two for $18.50 during the dip on May 19th. Yesterday they sold for $21.65 - $22.

I don't plan to hold until expiry. I bought them as a way to hedge against inflation, which I can barely grasp.

But my idea is that as inflation devalues the dollar, prices go up. ALL prices go up. From big macs to chicken tendies and stonks. 

Even if the market has a pull back, and the valuation of companies goes down aka SPY P/E drops. The actual dollar is worth less, so more dollars are needed to buy SPY. Thus SPY should go up as measured by the future dollar.

Essentially a SPY LEAP is like a mortgage. Even if property value goes down, inflation alone can make a 25 year mortgage worthwhile. Because you lock in based on todays dollar value. Imagine having a mortgage in Zimbabwe, Argentina, Venezuela before hyperinflation. Not that I expect hyper-inflation on the USD.

I'm not allowed to use margin, or sell covered calls/puts on my account.

Not sure what you mean about monthly 0.2 delta. My Greeks show delta (daily) of $0.38 and Theta of $0.023.

Even if SPY breaks $450 by Jan of next year, I should still be up 50%, see this http://opcalc.com/v4x",[],0

Although he might not deserve video games and exercise machines, I believe that discriminating against certain inmates is wrong no matter the crime.

I‚Äôm sure most of the Norwegian population would like to lock him in a hole and forget about him, and I can‚Äôt blame them. The problem with doing that is that it would open up for the possibility for future mistreatment of inmates, which would overall increase both recidivism and crime rates.

They went from $40M a year in 2017 to $400M in 2020 and their growth isn't slowing down. It's insane.

Further more They don't have development overhead. The players develop for them. They just have a core team managing the infrastructure which they are streamlining that some say with cut their overhead anywhere from 30-50% which would go back to their net ($120-$200M).

This would signal the end of the bull market.

That‚Äôs why I go here every day: around 20% to short hype plays (made a shitton this way), about 1% to find legit early long plays (extremely hard), 29% for the memes, and 50% for the shadenfreude (or however it‚Äôs spelled) of seeing people lose a ton of money in a stupid way.

But yeah, I do the same as you: 1-2% risk every time, fundamental analysis (mainly discounted cash flow to find true value), technical analysis (keep it simple, levels of structure, EMA50, MACD, and not much more) and the I either short or long according to my 1 or 2% risk. If the trade goes south, I take my 1-2% loss. If it goes right, I take my 2-3% gain (I usually go for 1.5 R/R).

3) If it moves it can be eaten. Said that, eating dog liver will kill you due to vitamin A overdose.

What they have done is quite simply amazing. It's something we as humans should be celebrating not what the hedge funds or the ""big boys"" are doing.

China doesn't have to hold titles for the largest economy or most EV cars produced. They will steal all the tech then license it out to other companies based in Europe or they will make all the parts and tech for other EV companies super cheap. The real goal of China is to control all the software that is in the EV cars. Then they can flip a switch one day that they control all the software on all the cars which in turn gives them all the power. The same argument is why they were rejected for 5G tech. Chinese companies are required to install hardware and software backdoors for the government.,['TSLA'],1

So, the laws in Chile and in the whole Latin America is way different that US bankruptcy laws. Last week I saw one news comparing LATAM Airlines situation as the new HERTZ where equity jumped from 1 to 6 usd once they restructured the company. The price action can be similar but the reasons will be different. There is now way that shareholders will loose its company to unsecured creditors, not in any Emerging Market country. So, if bonds are trading close to 100% of its par, why the equity is still between 25 - 30% of pre covid levels? Probably they will swap this debt into some convertible bond which in the end you might get diluted as an equity holder, but still I would assume at least 5 usd for this stock even in the event of a dilution, because we will be talking about a leader company in the region well positioned for the recovery and free of debt.
