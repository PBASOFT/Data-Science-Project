Now that internet based companies have blown up to the extreme they can’t be the next big thing anymore because they already are the big thing. 

What do you guys think the next big thing is with the way the world is headed? What, ten years from now, am i gunna look back on and think “why the hell didnt I invest into that it was so obvious.” I’ve been pondering this for a bit now and the best i can come up with is Energy Cells.

196,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"I had my fair share of losing money, trading capital drawdowns, busting my own trading capital many times before finally learning from past mistakes to become a better trader and stop do stuff like it's a mf casino.

I don’t want to share with you something that you all heard so many times (yep, I haven't lost my fate in humanity) like avoid margin trading or invest in mutual funds. I believe I have some wisdom I wish I had from the beginning.

1. Trading is just 5% theory and 95% about emotional control, risk and money management, overcoming one’s greed, having strict stoploss and targets predefined before taking a trade.
2. Don’t follow advice from forums blindly. Build your own map of the world. Each of us learn to trade at our own pace and don’t get discouraged if you find that after a few years, you’re still struggling to master the ‘money game’. You can keep in mind different advice from experienced players (e.g. I recommend this qooore app and it's discord community), *but it's vital for the final decision to be yours*.
3. Accept losses and do not make investment decisions based on emotion Especially greed, fear, or panic. Yep, you didn’t buy Betcoin (lol couldn't resist) at 3,000$ because you didn’t know back than what direction the price would take. No regrets. Keep yourself focused on here and now, move ahead
4. Know yourself. What is your current financial situation? Why you are investing? For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully.
5. Never forget that for investing, time is your best friend - and greed is your worst enemy. Patience is a requirement in stock trading. There are no short-cuts or ‘holy grail’ when it comes to stock. And you only need to have couple of strategies but those should be well tested and made perfect over the period of time.

To me, trading is a skill that requires 3Ls - ‘Life-Long Learning”.

Stay humble, be honest and willing to admit your mistakes in trading and don’t try to rationalise and explain mistakes away, and always remain teachable and never think you’ve ‘arrived’.",nlvay0,[],0

198,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"Hi Everyone! I did some research on cinema stocks a while back and made a video on it. I didn't post the content here so I thought I would share it as I know everyone is interested in AMC at the moment! I know it's a lot to read so if you prefer to watch the video, the link for that is also included below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s)

Why Cinema Stocks like AMC will benefit from reopening? 

Time-Frame: Cinema’s will benefit from reopening and the economic recovery that is occurring all over the world. Especially over a longer timeframe.  I think that Cinemas can be a good trade in the medium term and can help you make money. It’s all dependent on data and how quickly things go back to normal, but my timeframe on this trade right now is 1-2 years. Maybe even shorter, perhaps 6 months if we bounce back very quickly. Maybe not the most likely, but still a possible scenario that I have to consider. 

&#x200B;

Thesis: 

1)  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a very strong negative impact on the cinema sector. So, naturally as things reopen and vaccinations increase all over North America, these companies stand to benefit. If we look back from the end of January 2020 to the end of April 2021, Marcus Corporation was down approximately 33% from January 27th, 2020. Cinemark is down approximately 35% over the same time period, while National CineMedia is down almost 42% and AMC is up almost 57%. Price is an important factor to consider when buying and selling stocks and this something that is important to consider 

2) Cinemas have suffered tremendously with the Covid-19 pandemic, which makes the cinema sector intriguing as the world re-opens. If we look to Asia, especially China and Japan, where Covid-19 cases subsided and theatres reopened, things look promising.  There was a substantial increase in demand, with demand actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. In China, December 2020 ticket sales at IMAX’s big-screen theatres jumped 28 per cent from a year earlier, while in Japan, they broke daily records and a record number of people saw movies on the first weekend of January 2021. Clearly, there was a lot of pent-up demand which surfaced and benefitted movie theatres in Asia. 

3) And you know what I’ve seen this film before. Last year early in February, there was a sudden spike in downloads of the Zoom app in China, and the stock at that was point already doing well, up roughly 30 percent from the start of the year. But this spike in Zoom usage soon spread all over the world, and the rest is history. It was an absolutely humungous winner last year. There are obviously sector wide risks with consumer preferences changing, and more and more people preferring to watch films at home. The increase in Netflix & streaming service subscribers over the years is a clear indication of consumer preferences going-forward, but I do like movie theatres as a trade. There is a lot of pent-up demand that I feel will benefit the sector. 

Risks: 

\-  One of the main risks that that most people who are considering trading or investing in cinema companies have, is the risk from Netflix and the other streaming services. Really the risk of the Direct-to-consumer approach and the effects that it will have on the cinema companies. And this is a valid concern because it has reduced demand for cinemas over the last decade. Even some of the biggest filmmakers in the world are turning to it, like Martin Scorsese, Noah Baumbach and Alfonso Cuaron.  Netflix has become the biggest movie studio in the world, at-least when it comes to volume in terms of production over the last several years. And now they plan to release 50-60 films per year, and with their pioneering Direct to Consumer approach, the film industry has changed. Cinemas are no longer at the forefront, and the Direct-to-Consumer strategy is quickly becoming the new incumbent. The DTC approach is taking over, with all the streaming services that have launched. They have taken market share from linear television and have steered consumers away from traditional Cinema.

Catalysts & Conclusion: 

1) However, I still think there is still a place for theatres, even with streaming, especially looking at the same timeframe that I’m focusing on for this trade. I think now more so than ever people want to be outside. These businesses will benefit from the change in near term consumer trends, with everyone wanting to leave the house. I really believe that the cinema sector is going to do well in North America. If Asia is anything to go by and I think it is, some of the companies involved in the sector have the potential to be great trades. People still want to go to the cinemas, especially when it comes to seeing some of the big budget films that are really made for the big screen. Blockbuster action films with awesome effects are really meant to be seen in a movie theatre in my opinion. The effects and the environment simply cannot be replicated at home. Especially when it comes to immersive experience films, like those with IMAX and 4DX. I really enjoy the cinema and think there is something to be said for being in a big space in a dark room watching a film 40 feet across. It is wonderful to sit in the comfort of your own home but there is just something to be said for having a community experience in a room. But that’s neither there nor here. 

  
2) Moving on, another potential catalyst is the potential for collaboration between theatre chains and streaming services. Netflix was the one to pioneer the Direct to Consumer, but interestingly they have begun releasing some Netflix Originals on the big screen in recent years. Films like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes all premiered in Cinemas prior to their appearance in Netflix’s online catalogue.  This is a really interesting move on their part, especially from an investment perspective. Because, while you can watch streaming services in the comfort of your own home, movie theatre companies are open to the idea of having the films that are produced by the streaming services shown in their theatres. Cinemark has shown Netflix movies in theatres in the past, and there is an off chance that they expand their agreement. This wouldn’t just apply to Cinemark but other theatre chains as well potentially. The big hold-up between the streaming services and theatre chains was the disagreement on the length of theatrical window. But last year, Universal Studios and Cinemark, AMC & Cineplex agreed to a shortened exclusive window, from 74 days to 31 days for major films, as defined by box-office domestic revenue. This makes it more likely that Netflix and other streaming services can find middle ground with the cinema companies. It’s not all that important a catalyst for the trade, nor is it all that likely, but it is still intriguing and something to consider.

3) A more important catalyst is the release of the next James Bond film, no time to die next year. I’m really excited about the movie because I’m a huge James Bond fan. It’s probably my favourite movie series. And you know what, I’m not alone. It’s very popular all over the world. The previous James Bond film, Spectre, grossed nearly $879 million. No Time To Die has been postponed several times due to the pandemic and is due to premiere on October 8th in the United States. I’m really excited about the movie and will be sure to see in theatres provided it’s safe to do so. And I think it will be. This movie is really important for the movie theatres because they have been starved and there have just been very few films to show. They have been supply constrained with the lack of new films. No Time To Die is a certain blockbuster and will really help benefit the sector. 

4) Something else that has me really excited is the recent CDC news in the US, with them updating guidance on April 2nd that fully vaccinated people can travel internationally safely and don’t need to quarantine when they return provided, they test negative within three to five days of their return. They have to test negative before they are allowed to board a return flight to the US. This is really exciting, and this combined with the idea of a vaccine passport as has been proposed by cruise lines and the UK government really provide a lot of momentum for the cinema companies.

199,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"I will try to keep this short and sweet.
In my view the following points are justifiable:
-The VW emissions hack was not an effort to destroy the environment. 
-It was trolling done by VW officials bc they were tired of having the EPA’s pozzed dick in their asses regarding diesel emission regulations on diesel imports. 
-VW was tired of the EPA because:

     A.  In europe diesel autos make up over half of    
           all car engines. 
     B.  Cars like the Euro-version VW golf wagon      
           get almost 90 mpg. Compare that to the 
           Toyota Prius that gets 40mpg at best. 
     C.  The EPA doesnt want VW to import a 90    
           MPG diesel car to the US because it would    
           kill US auto sales, so the EPA makes diesel 
           regulations so strict that the only diesels 
           VW et. al. can import only manage 45 MPG. 
     D.  And if you want to make things fair, the 
           highest MPG diesel electric hybrid made by 
           VW gets over 200 MPG. 
     E.  Europeans aren’t idiots: they aren’t willingly 
          “poisoning themselves” with diesel fumes. 
          Diesel is just as clean as gas and burning 
          1 gallon of diesel fuel every 90 miles is 
          better for the environment than burning 1 
          gallon of gas every 30 miles. 
     F.  The “smelly/black fume producing” 
          reputation of diesel in america owes itself to 
          idiot US auto makers that in the 80’s tried to 
          make frankenstein diesel engines out of 
          modified gas engines and they ran like shit 
          and spewed black smoke. These atrocities    
          were unlike the clean running diesel engines 
          that were being produced in Germany at the 
          same time. 
-In summary, the EPA has been punishing European Auto makers (VW) for American auto makers’ past engineering disgraces, and when VW officials got tired of being unfairly punished they decided to troll the EPA with an emissions hack. 
-They did it to slam some jimmies, not to gain      
profit or destroy the environment. 
-German authorities know this, which is why they released key players like Oliver Schmidt who was let out on parole right after he was transferred from US prison to German authorities. 
-The loss of stock value that occured from the scandal was unjustified then, and the stagnation of VW stock price since then has been unjustified in light of the fact that VW’s P/E in the last 3 months has been between 50-70 times lower than that of Tesla, and historically it has been foolish to underestimate the ability of Volkswagen to perform at the cutting edge of the industry. 
-The Emissions hack has nothing negative to say about Volkswagens fierce engineering capability and in my view it has something positive to say about the youthfulness and creativity of the company.

209,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic has two revenue streams.

1. Commercial Passenger Flights:

They expect to fly 25 commercial flights in 2022, with six passengers each, which means 150 passengers for 2022.

Ticket cost is around $250k, which translates into revenues of approximately $37.5 million from Commercial Passengers in 2022

2. Additional Revenue:

Besides commercial passengers, the company has also generated some revenue by carrying payloads into space in recent years. Assuming that this will grow to about $12 million by 2022, total revenues would stand at $50 million for the year.

Revenue Per Share is likely to grow to about $0.21 in 2022, assuming total shares outstanding of 234 million.

**Shorting $GLD**

$GLD mostly follows real rates and then the $. 

What has allowed $GLD to prosper recently has been :

a) Ever dovish FED decreasing nominal rates as much as they can via their speeches & slower than expected job gains which have cemented FED forecasts

b) Ever rising inflation expectations due to faulty base effects that are transitory

c) Some impact from Crapto crash with money flowing back into $GLD (some of it at least :/)

a) FED's Clarida & Quarles yesterday have both suggested the beginning of tapering discussions 

> Late yesterday, the Fed’s Quarles said “it will become important for the FOMC to begin discussing our plans to adjust the pace of asset purchases at upcoming meetings.” Quarles is the Fed’s Vice Chair for Supervision and it is unusual for him to comment on monetary policy.

aBis) The NFP last month was a serious miss but it's not gonna be repeated : as schools reopen and UIs are not extended in a lot of states, the slaves will go back to finding a slave master before jobs run out. employers have also adjusted somewhat with regards to wage expectations already which should make for a much more balanced jobs market going into the begining of school season

b) Inflation (in CPI sense) has peaked in April or will peak now, Commos have crashed thanks to our lords and saviors, the ccp tightening margins and putting an end to this story.

226,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"Just thinking out loud here, no advice found in this tread.

What a day yesterday, but as expected per my last DD. The question now is since MVIS is sub $15 - will the downward movement continue or will the stock stagnate around $15 for awhile?

Looking at the usual metrics, the only thing that can significantly answer this question is the placement of options for now. This is because:

https://preview.redd.it/61qdor9stn171.png?width=2228&format=png&auto=webp&s=01556f96df70c1f4293f70b4f707763e2594640d

There is reasonable protection from dealer gamma - but this can be a double-edged sword if it rises too quickly too much. But in this case, a marginal decrease with a significant price drop is a relatively good sign .

The price, despite its drop, ended about where it was expected to (at the lower band of expectation):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7oiku922un171.png?width=2192&format=png&auto=webp&s=72d134ddb771c880e75591ac8beab90417ac896a

https://preview.redd.it/u3elpj34un171.png?width=2120&format=png&auto=webp&s=df325eb5f5650313c6dac91446c37681c21f333c

The options landscape hasn't changed that much, relatively speaking. The price moved down below the largest chunk of calls at $15, again as expected.

So in attempting to divine the future, one must ask: are there any forces at play that are more significant than the others? The answer: currently - no, but the cliff is near.

Take a peak at these metrics:

https://preview.redd.it/022b4ildun171.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=3895f4fb62252b9f4e3b9a2a9949f025598675fe

These are the number of shares (assuming all dealer intermediary) that must be bought or sold per combination of price / IV increase.

MVIS is in the uncomfortable position where *any increase in IV will result in selling*. This is unusual and slightly unhealthy. 

So MVIS seems entirely contingent currently on liquidity: if it remains low, then it will probably waiver around $15 until big upstream moves are made. If IV begins to rise, than a cycle of selling could be initiated. Per the options, if this happens, the only 'floor' of sorts would be around $10 with the \~18k Puts.

Morning everyone. This post is by no way detailed with statistics or a deep dive into the company, this is just something I have been watching over the past 6 months as a very active social media user. Draftkings has 3-4 active Twitter accounts. The main one of coarse being simply @ Draftkings with 320K folowers (@ Fanduel only has 254k but who is keeping score) . Anyway, as Draftkings rolls out new programs like Sports Betting (@ DKSportsbook) or Casino (@ DKCasino) and you can get a pretty good idea of what the company will be doing or acting like by simply scrolling down their feed.

Well if you have a minute, I suggest you scroll down the Twitter feed of @ DKCasino. They only have 200 posts or so since they are relatively new but you can see that when they started posting late last year, and literally only being live in a handful of states, they had free money promotions with almost no interaction. But now, especially the past month or so, you will notice every one of their tweets is now 

1) a direct advertisement of one of their games that you can currently play

2)a sign up promotion 

3) interactions with a player who has won money. 

4) starting to have 30+ comments on every tweet. 

I think #3 is the key to the future. When investing in Draftkings everyone including myself constantly thinks ""Sports betting"" which we can all agree is a young mans/woman's game. Very few, including myself, have realized that Draftkings will be using all its power of brand name, player connection and social media to delivery a full LEGAL casino to your iPhone. The last sentence is simply fact, as I stated @ Draftkings twitter account has 320K followers, the @ DKCasino only has..... 2607 followers. YUP, thats IT, only TWO THOUSAND followers so far. I think this is a huge reason institutional investors like Blackrock or ARK are going in head first. They are buying a fully legal casino delivered to your door. You know those busses they run out of retirement homes into Casinos and back 3 times a week? Well why on earth would those old people spend hours on busses when the future of Casinos is a Draftkings app on a 24 inch Ipad screen in their rooms? 

Now you say "" Hey buddy, what does Draftkings know about casinos when they will be competing with PENN or MGM or WYNN. And in a sense you are right. But for a second, lets look at that retirement home scenario. Draftkings has NO brick and mortar casinos. Unlike PENN or MGM. Who benefits more from your grandmother NOT taking the free shuttle bus to the brick Casino, PENN/MGM who make money either way, or Draftkings who spends 0.0 $ on storefronts, employees, and every penny that Grandma spends playing in her room is 100% PURE profit taken away from PENN or MGM. 

Everyone keeps focusing on the amount of money Draftkings has spent on customer acquisition lately. That is the reason the stock price is down. Well if you think of them acquiring future Casino customers that they are taking away from PENN, MGM and WYNN. It makes more sense of why they are spending so hard.",nm7muv,[],0

Have you ever seen the movie War Dogs staring known stock expert [Jonah Hill](https://www.businessinsider.com/jonah-hill-hospitalized-fake-cocaine-in-wolf-of-wall-street-2016-8)?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, I’ve got some juicy DD for you. No longer is profiting off of human uncertainty and violence exclusively a rich man’s game. Allow me to explain: 

Vista Outdoors ($VSTO) is an outdoor sports and recreation company that owns several recognizable brands such as Camelbak, Camp Chef, and Bushnell. But that’s not important. You’re reading this because you wanna make quick cash off of the collapse of society. Well $VSTO has got you covered.  

$VSTO owns a massive portion of the shooting sports market. In September of last year they acquired all of Remington’s ammunition factories, the last of which began full-scale production earlier this [year. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/aaronsmith/2021/02/04/bullet-sales-are-booming-as-vista-brings-remington-factory-online/amp/)

In addition to Remington, $VSTO also owns the ammunition brands Federal Premium, CCI, Hevi-shot, Estate Cartridge, and Speer. This accounts for the majority of ammunition produced in the US. 

They also own Alliant Powder, one of the largest producers of smokeless gunpowder in the United States.

You get the idea: if someone is buying ammo, they’re doing it through $VSTO. 

Why is this important? How will this make me money? 

Well right now the US is experiencing one of the largest ammunition shortages in [history.](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/cant-find-ammo-why-great-bullet-shortage-could-last-years-185734)

This shortage is being driven my unprecedented demand for guns and ammo. A combination of fears over [Biden’s ](https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/) gun control plans, a rise in civil unrest, and plain old boredom have caused ammo sales to [skyrocket.](https://thecrimereport.org/2021/01/13/gun-sales-spike-across-the-u-s-following-capitol-riots/) 

Last year roughly 9 million Americans bought guns for the first time. In January 2021 alone, the ATF reported 4.1 million background checks for gun purchases, the largest single month since record keeping [began](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/43371461)

All of these guns are being purchased, and you can’t find ammo fucking *anywhere*. I don’t think it takes a rocket surgeon to understand that guns are useless hunks of metal without ammo to make the boomsticks go boom. 

To prove my point, you can do a little experiment right now in the comfort of your wife’s boyfriend’s home. Try calling your local gun store and ask if you can come in today and purchase 500 rounds of 9mm ammo. When they laugh in your face you’ll see what I’m talking about. 

Late last year, when demand wasn’t as high as it is now, $VSTO reported a backlog of $1 billion dollars in ammunition sales. 1 fucking [BILLION.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/vista-outdoors-ammunition-backlog-billion.amp)
 
They have nearly [doubled ](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/vsto/earnings) their estimated earnings for the past three quarters, and the trend shows no signs of slowing down. 

Their P/E ratio is still hovering at around 8.5/9.0 indicating that the stock is still criminally undervalued. 

This company is printing money as fast as they can make it, and they’ve just acquired more money making factories. You don’t need so much as a single brain wrinkle to understand what I’m saying.

# Discussion:

**What’s a good bet in the short term?**

Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Tech (didn’t think I’d be saying that) is looking pretty nice in the short term. The follow companies in Tech (XLK) have shown some strength and gone on a bit of a run.

The following companies are showing signs they may run up in the coming months. Personally, I’d narrow my research to these companies. I’m a semiconductor nerd, so I’m happy to see signs of a turnaround in INTC, AMD, and MU.

**What’s a good bet in the long term?**

Utilities (XLU), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Healthcare (XLV) all look like good sectors for long term bets. The problem is that they are starting to underperform the SPY in the short term.

XLRE seems to be floating around with the SPY, and slightly outperforming in the short term. 

Personally, I’m going to focus on short term investments within strong short term sectors until I see the trajectory for these long term plays start to turn around in the short term.

3800,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"Just thinking out loud here, no advice found in this tread.

What a day yesterday, but as expected per my last DD. The question now is since MVIS is sub $15 - will the downward movement continue or will the stock stagnate around $15 for awhile?

Looking at the usual metrics, the only thing that can significantly answer this question is the placement of options for now. This is because:

https://preview.redd.it/61qdor9stn171.png?width=2228&format=png&auto=webp&s=01556f96df70c1f4293f70b4f707763e2594640d

There is reasonable protection from dealer gamma - but this can be a double-edged sword if it rises too quickly too much. But in this case, a marginal decrease with a significant price drop is a relatively good sign .

The price, despite its drop, ended about where it was expected to (at the lower band of expectation):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7oiku922un171.png?width=2192&format=png&auto=webp&s=72d134ddb771c880e75591ac8beab90417ac896a

The options landscape hasn't changed that much, relatively speaking. The price moved down below the largest chunk of calls at $15, again as expected.

So in attempting to divine the future, one must ask: are there any forces at play that are more significant than the others? The answer: currently - no, but the cliff is near.

Take a peak at these metrics:

https://preview.redd.it/022b4ildun171.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=3895f4fb62252b9f4e3b9a2a9949f025598675fe

These are the number of shares (assuming all dealer intermediary) that must be bought or sold per combination of price / IV increase.

MVIS is in the uncomfortable position where *any increase in IV will result in selling*. This is unusual and slightly unhealthy. 

So MVIS seems entirely contingent currently on liquidity: if it remains low, then it will probably waiver around $15 until big upstream moves are made. If IV begins to rise, than a cycle of selling could be initiated. Per the options, if this happens, the only 'floor' of sorts would be around $10 with the \~18k Puts.

Keep an eye on volatility!",nm6vg7,[],1

3805,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"  

Morning everyone. This post is by no way detailed with statistics or a deep dive into the company, this is just something I have been watching over the past 6 months as a very active social media user. Draftkings has 3-4 active Twitter accounts. The main one of coarse being simply @ Draftkings with 320K folowers (@ Fanduel only has 254k but who is keeping score) . Anyway, as Draftkings rolls out new programs like Sports Betting (@ DKSportsbook) or Casino (@ DKCasino) and you can get a pretty good idea of what the company will be doing or acting like by simply scrolling down their feed.

Well if you have a minute, I suggest you scroll down the Twitter feed of @ DKCasino. They only have 200 posts or so since they are relatively new but you can see that when they started posting late last year, and literally only being live in a handful of states, they had free money promotions with almost no interaction. But now, especially the past month or so, you will notice every one of their tweets is now 

1) a direct advertisement of one of their games that you can currently play

2)a sign up promotion 

3) interactions with a player who has won money. 

4) starting to have 30+ comments on every tweet. 

I think #3 is the key to the future. When investing in Draftkings everyone including myself constantly thinks ""Sports betting"" which we can all agree is a young mans/woman's game. Very few, including myself, have realized that Draftkings will be using all its power of brand name, player connection and social media to delivery a full LEGAL casino to your iPhone. The last sentence is simply fact, as I stated @ Draftkings twitter account has 320K followers, the @ DKCasino only has..... 2607 followers. YUP, thats IT, only TWO THOUSAND followers so far. I think this is a huge reason institutional investors like Blackrock or ARK are going in head first. They are buying a fully legal casino delivered to your door. You know those busses they run out of retirement homes into Casinos and back 3 times a week? Well why on earth would those old people spend hours on busses when the future of Casinos is a Draftkings app on a 24 inch Ipad screen in their rooms? 

Now you say "" Hey buddy, what does Draftkings know about casinos when they will be competing with PENN or MGM or WYNN. And in a sense you are right. But for a second, lets look at that retirement home scenario. Draftkings has NO brick and mortar casinos. Unlike PENN or MGM. Who benefits more from your grandmother NOT taking the free shuttle bus to the brick Casino, PENN/MGM who make money either way, or Draftkings who spends 0.0 $ on storefronts, employees, and every penny that Grandma spends playing in her room is 100% PURE profit taken away from PENN or MGM. 

Everyone keeps focusing on the amount of money Draftkings has spent on customer acquisition lately. That is the reason the stock price is down. Well if you think of them acquiring future Casino customers that they are taking away from PENN, MGM and WYNN. It makes more sense of why they are spending so hard.",nm7muv,[],0

Have you ever seen the movie War Dogs staring known stock expert [Jonah Hill](https://www.businessinsider.com/jonah-hill-hospitalized-fake-cocaine-in-wolf-of-wall-street-2016-8)?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, I’ve got some juicy DD for you. No longer is profiting off of human uncertainty and violence exclusively a rich man’s game. Allow me to explain: 

Vista Outdoors ($VSTO) is an outdoor sports and recreation company that owns several recognizable brands such as Camelbak, Camp Chef, and Bushnell. But that’s not important. You’re reading this because you wanna make quick cash off of the collapse of society. Well $VSTO has got you covered.  

$VSTO owns a massive portion of the shooting sports market. In September of last year they acquired all of Remington’s ammunition factories, the last of which began full-scale production earlier this [year. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/aaronsmith/2021/02/04/bullet-sales-are-booming-as-vista-brings-remington-factory-online/amp/)

In addition to Remington, $VSTO also owns the ammunition brands Federal Premium, CCI, Hevi-shot, Estate Cartridge, and Speer. This accounts for the majority of ammunition produced in the US. 

They also own Alliant Powder, one of the largest producers of smokeless gunpowder in the United States.

You get the idea: if someone is buying ammo, they’re doing it through $VSTO. 

Why is this important? How will this make me money? 

Well right now the US is experiencing one of the largest ammunition shortages in [history.](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/cant-find-ammo-why-great-bullet-shortage-could-last-years-185734)

This shortage is being driven my unprecedented demand for guns and ammo. A combination of fears over [Biden’s ](https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/) gun control plans, a rise in civil unrest, and plain old boredom have caused ammo sales to [skyrocket.](https://thecrimereport.org/2021/01/13/gun-sales-spike-across-the-u-s-following-capitol-riots/) 

Last year roughly 9 million Americans bought guns for the first time. In January 2021 alone, the ATF reported 4.1 million background checks for gun purchases, the largest single month since record keeping [began](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/43371461)

All of these guns are being purchased, and you can’t find ammo fucking *anywhere*. I don’t think it takes a rocket surgeon to understand that guns are useless hunks of metal without ammo to make the boomsticks go boom. 

To prove my point, you can do a little experiment right now in the comfort of your wife’s boyfriend’s home. Try calling your local gun store and ask if you can come in today and purchase 500 rounds of 9mm ammo. When they laugh in your face you’ll see what I’m talking about. 

Late last year, when demand wasn’t as high as it is now, $VSTO reported a backlog of $1 billion dollars in ammunition sales. 1 fucking [BILLION.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/vista-outdoors-ammunition-backlog-billion.amp)
 
They have nearly [doubled ](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/vsto/earnings) their estimated earnings for the past three quarters, and the trend shows no signs of slowing down. 

Their P/E ratio is still hovering at around 8.5/9.0 indicating that the stock is still criminally undervalued. 

This company is printing money as fast as they can make it, and they’ve just acquired more money making factories. You don’t need so much as a single brain wrinkle to understand what I’m saying.

# Discussion:

**What’s a good bet in the short term?**

Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Tech (didn’t think I’d be saying that) is looking pretty nice in the short term. The follow companies in Tech (XLK) have shown some strength and gone on a bit of a run.

**What’s a good bet in the long term?**

Utilities (XLU), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Healthcare (XLV) all look like good sectors for long term bets. The problem is that they are starting to underperform the SPY in the short term.

XLRE seems to be floating around with the SPY, and slightly outperforming in the short term. 

Personally, I’m going to focus on short term investments within strong short term sectors until I see the trajectory for these long term plays start to turn around in the short term.

It is no secret that AMC is a play simply for a short squeeze. AMC was horribly run before Covid, and it is no different now.

Besides having a higher short float than AMC (which is AMC's only premise). If AMC is able to return to 2019 profitability - it still would not be enough profit to service their new debt (180M/QTR (interest payments alone)).

CNK was actually profitable before COVID and unlike AMC, actually has some net equity. While AMC has gone up over 1000% in equity value (700M to 7B+) since COVID, CNK is actually trading at a 40% discount still precovid (with 20% short)

I am not even going for a sympathy play here, this is a long term move to which I easily see CNK trading at $40+, especially when news release this fall says: ""Third Quarter Results: Cinemark has first profitable quarter along with its peers IMAX and Marcus - while AMC lost another $100M in unmanageable debt""

5173,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"Just thinking out loud here, no advice found in this tread.

What a day yesterday, but as expected per my last DD. The question now is since MVIS is sub $15 - will the downward movement continue or will the stock stagnate around $15 for awhile?

Looking at the usual metrics, the only thing that can significantly answer this question is the placement of options for now. This is because:

https://preview.redd.it/61qdor9stn171.png?width=2228&format=png&auto=webp&s=01556f96df70c1f4293f70b4f707763e2594640d

There is reasonable protection from dealer gamma - but this can be a double-edged sword if it rises too quickly too much. But in this case, a marginal decrease with a significant price drop is a relatively good sign .

The price, despite its drop, ended about where it was expected to (at the lower band of expectation):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7oiku922un171.png?width=2192&format=png&auto=webp&s=72d134ddb771c880e75591ac8beab90417ac896a

The options landscape hasn't changed that much, relatively speaking. The price moved down below the largest chunk of calls at $15, again as expected.

So in attempting to divine the future, one must ask: are there any forces at play that are more significant than the others? The answer: currently - no, but the cliff is near.

Take a peak at these metrics:

https://preview.redd.it/022b4ildun171.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=3895f4fb62252b9f4e3b9a2a9949f025598675fe

These are the number of shares (assuming all dealer intermediary) that must be bought or sold per combination of price / IV increase.

MVIS is in the uncomfortable position where *any increase in IV will result in selling*. This is unusual and slightly unhealthy. 

So MVIS seems entirely contingent currently on liquidity: if it remains low, then it will probably waiver around $15 until big upstream moves are made. If IV begins to rise, than a cycle of selling could be initiated. Per the options, if this happens, the only 'floor' of sorts would be around $10 with the \~18k Puts.

Keep an eye on volatility!",nm6vg7,[],1

Morning everyone. This post is by no way detailed with statistics or a deep dive into the company, this is just something I have been watching over the past 6 months as a very active social media user. Draftkings has 3-4 active Twitter accounts. The main one of coarse being simply @ Draftkings with 320K folowers (@ Fanduel only has 254k but who is keeping score) . Anyway, as Draftkings rolls out new programs like Sports Betting (@ DKSportsbook) or Casino (@ DKCasino) and you can get a pretty good idea of what the company will be doing or acting like by simply scrolling down their feed.

Well if you have a minute, I suggest you scroll down the Twitter feed of @ DKCasino. They only have 200 posts or so since they are relatively new but you can see that when they started posting late last year, and literally only being live in a handful of states, they had free money promotions with almost no interaction. But now, especially the past month or so, you will notice every one of their tweets is now 

1) a direct advertisement of one of their games that you can currently play

2)a sign up promotion 

3) interactions with a player who has won money. 

4) starting to have 30+ comments on every tweet. 

I think #3 is the key to the future. When investing in Draftkings everyone including myself constantly thinks ""Sports betting"" which we can all agree is a young mans/woman's game. Very few, including myself, have realized that Draftkings will be using all its power of brand name, player connection and social media to delivery a full LEGAL casino to your iPhone. The last sentence is simply fact, as I stated @ Draftkings twitter account has 320K followers, the @ DKCasino only has..... 2607 followers. YUP, thats IT, only TWO THOUSAND followers so far. I think this is a huge reason institutional investors like Blackrock or ARK are going in head first. They are buying a fully legal casino delivered to your door. You know those busses they run out of retirement homes into Casinos and back 3 times a week? Well why on earth would those old people spend hours on busses when the future of Casinos is a Draftkings app on a 24 inch Ipad screen in their rooms? 

Now you say "" Hey buddy, what does Draftkings know about casinos when they will be competing with PENN or MGM or WYNN. And in a sense you are right. But for a second, lets look at that retirement home scenario. Draftkings has NO brick and mortar casinos. Unlike PENN or MGM. Who benefits more from your grandmother NOT taking the free shuttle bus to the brick Casino, PENN/MGM who make money either way, or Draftkings who spends 0.0 $ on storefronts, employees, and every penny that Grandma spends playing in her room is 100% PURE profit taken away from PENN or MGM. 

Everyone keeps focusing on the amount of money Draftkings has spent on customer acquisition lately. That is the reason the stock price is down. Well if you think of them acquiring future Casino customers that they are taking away from PENN, MGM and WYNN. It makes more sense of why they are spending so hard.",nm7muv,[],0

Options - look at the options ! Not only is there an insane amount of Open Interest, but there is no time value in the calls. Super cheap premium. You can buy $5 calls all the way out to DEC within 5 cents of current stock price.  Meaning you can go big and buy time, for almost zero premium. 

This is the real play. If UWMC had 1/10 of the volume AMC did yesterday it would have MOONED. It can happen. 🚀💸

Did you secretly wish you were one of the degenerate gamblers from Star Wars: the Last Jedi? 

Have you ever seen the movie War Dogs staring known stock expert [Jonah Hill](https://www.businessinsider.com/jonah-hill-hospitalized-fake-cocaine-in-wolf-of-wall-street-2016-8)?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, I’ve got some juicy DD for you. No longer is profiting off of human uncertainty and violence exclusively a rich man’s game. Allow me to explain: 

Vista Outdoors ($VSTO) is an outdoor sports and recreation company that owns several recognizable brands such as Camelbak, Camp Chef, and Bushnell. But that’s not important. You’re reading this because you wanna make quick cash off of the collapse of society. Well $VSTO has got you covered.  

$VSTO owns a massive portion of the shooting sports market. In September of last year they acquired all of Remington’s ammunition factories, the last of which began full-scale production earlier this [year. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/aaronsmith/2021/02/04/bullet-sales-are-booming-as-vista-brings-remington-factory-online/amp/)

In addition to Remington, $VSTO also owns the ammunition brands Federal Premium, CCI, Hevi-shot, Estate Cartridge, and Speer. This accounts for the majority of ammunition produced in the US. 

They also own Alliant Powder, one of the largest producers of smokeless gunpowder in the United States.

You get the idea: if someone is buying ammo, they’re doing it through $VSTO. 

Why is this important? How will this make me money? 

Well right now the US is experiencing one of the largest ammunition shortages in [history.](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/cant-find-ammo-why-great-bullet-shortage-could-last-years-185734)

This shortage is being driven my unprecedented demand for guns and ammo. A combination of fears over [Biden’s ](https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/) gun control plans, a rise in civil unrest, and plain old boredom have caused ammo sales to [skyrocket.](https://thecrimereport.org/2021/01/13/gun-sales-spike-across-the-u-s-following-capitol-riots/) 

Last year roughly 9 million Americans bought guns for the first time. In January 2021 alone, the ATF reported 4.1 million background checks for gun purchases, the largest single month since record keeping [began](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/43371461)

All of these guns are being purchased, and you can’t find ammo fucking *anywhere*. I don’t think it takes a rocket surgeon to understand that guns are useless hunks of metal without ammo to make the boomsticks go boom. 

To prove my point, you can do a little experiment right now in the comfort of your wife’s boyfriend’s home. Try calling your local gun store and ask if you can come in today and purchase 500 rounds of 9mm ammo. When they laugh in your face you’ll see what I’m talking about. 

Late last year, when demand wasn’t as high as it is now, $VSTO reported a backlog of $1 billion dollars in ammunition sales. 1 fucking [BILLION.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/vista-outdoors-ammunition-backlog-billion.amp)
 
They have nearly [doubled ](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/vsto/earnings) their estimated earnings for the past three quarters, and the trend shows no signs of slowing down. 

Their P/E ratio is still hovering at around 8.5/9.0 indicating that the stock is still criminally undervalued. 

This company is printing money as fast as they can make it, and they’ve just acquired more money making factories. You don’t need so much as a single brain wrinkle to understand what I’m saying.

# Discussion:

**What’s a good bet in the short term?**

Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Tech (didn’t think I’d be saying that) is looking pretty nice in the short term. The follow companies in Tech (XLK) have shown some strength and gone on a bit of a run.

The following companies are showing signs they may run up in the coming months. Personally, I’d narrow my research to these companies. I’m a semiconductor nerd, so I’m happy to see signs of a turnaround in INTC, AMD, and MU.

**What’s a good bet in the long term?**

Utilities (XLU), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Healthcare (XLV) all look like good sectors for long term bets. The problem is that they are starting to underperform the SPY in the short term.

XLRE seems to be floating around with the SPY, and slightly outperforming in the short term. 

Personally, I’m going to focus on short term investments within strong short term sectors until I see the trajectory for these long term plays start to turn around in the short term.

It is no secret that AMC is a play simply for a short squeeze. AMC was horribly run before Covid, and it is no different now.

Besides having a higher short float than AMC (which is AMC's only premise). If AMC is able to return to 2019 profitability - it still would not be enough profit to service their new debt (180M/QTR (interest payments alone)).

CNK was actually profitable before COVID and unlike AMC, actually has some net equity. While AMC has gone up over 1000% in equity value (700M to 7B+) since COVID, CNK is actually trading at a 40% discount still precovid (with 20% short)

I am not even going for a sympathy play here, this is a long term move to which I easily see CNK trading at $40+, especially when news release this fall says: ""Third Quarter Results: Cinemark has first profitable quarter along with its peers IMAX and Marcus - while AMC lost another $100M in unmanageable debt""

In February they announced some incredible data for their 6-month open label study. That was the reason for the massive price increase. After that, the share price started declining due to some uncertainty. But a few weeks ago they announced to present the 9-month data set on a huge scientific conference in July.

For me that's a very very positive signal! Just imagine - would you present a failure on such a big stage? Certainly NO! Personally I used this opportunity to buy more shares.

The anticipation of the data release has already started but I am still adding below 60$. The CEO already spreaded some excitement about the data. He didn't want to ""spill the beans yet"", since Cassava is not allowed to publish the new study data before the conference. 

I am actually super bullish on this and can't wait to see the new data.

8173,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"Have you been watching the news over this past year and thought to yourself “there’s gotta be a way to turn these problems into money”? 

Did you secretly wish you were one of the degenerate gamblers from Star Wars: the Last Jedi? 

Have you ever seen the movie War Dogs staring known stock expert [Jonah Hill](https://www.businessinsider.com/jonah-hill-hospitalized-fake-cocaine-in-wolf-of-wall-street-2016-8)?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, I’ve got some juicy DD for you. No longer is profiting off of human uncertainty and violence exclusively a rich man’s game. Allow me to explain: 

Vista Outdoors ($VSTO) is an outdoor sports and recreation company that owns several recognizable brands such as Camelbak, Camp Chef, and Bushnell. But that’s not important. You’re reading this because you wanna make quick cash off of the collapse of society. Well $VSTO has got you covered.  

$VSTO owns a massive portion of the shooting sports market. In September of last year they acquired all of Remington’s ammunition factories, the last of which began full-scale production earlier this [year. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/aaronsmith/2021/02/04/bullet-sales-are-booming-as-vista-brings-remington-factory-online/amp/)

In addition to Remington, $VSTO also owns the ammunition brands Federal Premium, CCI, Hevi-shot, Estate Cartridge, and Speer. This accounts for the majority of ammunition produced in the US. 

They also own Alliant Powder, one of the largest producers of smokeless gunpowder in the United States.

You get the idea: if someone is buying ammo, they’re doing it through $VSTO. 

Why is this important? How will this make me money? 

Well right now the US is experiencing one of the largest ammunition shortages in [history.](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/cant-find-ammo-why-great-bullet-shortage-could-last-years-185734)

This shortage is being driven my unprecedented demand for guns and ammo. A combination of fears over [Biden’s ](https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/) gun control plans, a rise in civil unrest, and plain old boredom have caused ammo sales to [skyrocket.](https://thecrimereport.org/2021/01/13/gun-sales-spike-across-the-u-s-following-capitol-riots/) 

Last year roughly 9 million Americans bought guns for the first time. In January 2021 alone, the ATF reported 4.1 million background checks for gun purchases, the largest single month since record keeping [began](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/43371461)

All of these guns are being purchased, and you can’t find ammo fucking *anywhere*. I don’t think it takes a rocket surgeon to understand that guns are useless hunks of metal without ammo to make the boomsticks go boom. 

To prove my point, you can do a little experiment right now in the comfort of your wife’s boyfriend’s home. Try calling your local gun store and ask if you can come in today and purchase 500 rounds of 9mm ammo. When they laugh in your face you’ll see what I’m talking about. 

Late last year, when demand wasn’t as high as it is now, $VSTO reported a backlog of $1 billion dollars in ammunition sales. 1 fucking [BILLION.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/vista-outdoors-ammunition-backlog-billion.amp)
 
They have nearly [doubled ](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/vsto/earnings) their estimated earnings for the past three quarters, and the trend shows no signs of slowing down. 

Their P/E ratio is still hovering at around 8.5/9.0 indicating that the stock is still criminally undervalued. 

This company is printing money as fast as they can make it, and they’ve just acquired more money making factories. You don’t need so much as a single brain wrinkle to understand what I’m saying.

# Discussion:

**What’s a good bet in the short term?**

Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Tech (didn’t think I’d be saying that) is looking pretty nice in the short term. The follow companies in Tech (XLK) have shown some strength and gone on a bit of a run.

https://preview.redd.it/utk79n1qlo171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c33200cbf190f0898afe16c76a22a9353257f036

The following companies are showing signs they may run up in the coming months. Personally, I’d narrow my research to these companies. I’m a semiconductor nerd, so I’m happy to see signs of a turnaround in INTC, AMD, and MU.

**What’s a good bet in the long term?**

Utilities (XLU), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Healthcare (XLV) all look like good sectors for long term bets. The problem is that they are starting to underperform the SPY in the short term.

XLRE seems to be floating around with the SPY, and slightly outperforming in the short term. 

Personally, I’m going to focus on short term investments within strong short term sectors until I see the trajectory for these long term plays start to turn around in the short term.

**This is a Casino Sir - My Bets/Positions:**

**XLK -– Long Call - 7/16 @ 0.7 delta**

**XLY -– Long Call - 7/16 @ 0.7 delta**

Wanted to enter a PAYC PCS but the B/A was too wide.

**MU –- PCS – 7/16 @ 0.7 delta for credit > 1/3 strike width**

Days to cover: 3.5+ 

The short positions have been increasing over the last few weeks as the price dropped. The squeeze has already begun. 

The company itself has stellar earnings with people sleeping on their food services growth (covid shutdown restaurants). The international retail sales are growing at triple digits with room to run. Meatless products are a growing trend, not a shrinking one and the only supplier with enough firepower to fill demand is BYND. They have been building out their infrastructure further over the last year, expanding their partnerships, and have a stellar CEO in Ethan Brown. As the food services industry comes back online so will BYND's sales in the category. Their retail sales continued to grow YoY even as people slowed down stock piling of groceries.

It is no secret that AMC is a play simply for a short squeeze. AMC was horribly run before Covid, and it is no different now.

Besides having a higher short float than AMC (which is AMC's only premise). If AMC is able to return to 2019 profitability - it still would not be enough profit to service their new debt (180M/QTR (interest payments alone)).

CNK was actually profitable before COVID and unlike AMC, actually has some net equity. While AMC has gone up over 1000% in equity value (700M to 7B+) since COVID, CNK is actually trading at a 40% discount still precovid (with 20% short)

I am not even going for a sympathy play here, this is a long term move to which I easily see CNK trading at $40+, especially when news release this fall says: ""Third Quarter Results: Cinemark has first profitable quarter along with its peers IMAX and Marcus - while AMC lost another $100M in unmanageable debt""

8239,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"Dear apes,

I present to you a stock, TTCF or Tattooed Chef, that is with 38% short interest DESPITE NO DEBT and great fundamentals : 


- Revenues growing anywhere between 50% to 70%/yearly
- Losing very very small amounts of money as the company expands
- Gross margin is around 25%
- Tailwind from the industry - healthy plant based food, products get sold out very fast
- A lot of cash, NO DEBT
- CEO has 35 years of experience in the industry(producing and selling food to stores) and has a cool Italian mafia name - Sam Galletti
- At the end of 2020 they were to be found in 4300 stores in the US. They expect they will be in over 10.000 stores in the US by the end of 2021. And possibility also to start expanding in Europe. 
- P/S ratio is NOT even 10(expected revenue for 2021 is 260-280 Million). While other growth stocks sell for 20-30 P/S despite growing slower.

SO, despite all of these things, short interest has EXPLODED. 3 months ago there were some shorters. Especially in the last 1 month it has grown exponentially. Last month it was at 29%. Over the last few weeks TTCF's price recovered from $15 to $23 and they decided to double down on their shorts making the short interest at 38%. 

GREAT FUNDAMENTALS + SHORT SQUEEZE - honestly these billionaires are playing with fire.

NOTE: I just wanted to bring this to your attention as the shorts want to destroy a fast growing company that is honestly doing nothing wrong. This isn't investment advice as I am not qualified to do so, so don't YOLO because of this post or whatever. Kthxbye",nmckk8,[],1
