You state there are horrible things in the past
I state that I studied those experiences and can see where certain events are misconstrued, and where some were horrible and can be denounced within the context of a system that still works. Like for example that Mountain Meadows was done by mormons who were not authorized by any leadership and that it was condemned. 
You reply ""I'm glad you can ignore all the terrible things in church history to make yourself feel better""
Seriously? It doesn't matter what anyone says when they talk to people like you. You ignore it and then make unfounded statements like that again. 
Conversion therapy was never authorized by the church. People just took it and ran with it. You should already know that there are humans in religion. Humans do stupid things. That is not the same as religion telling them to do it.

LDS missionaries are told to invite. They dont slaughter villages to force conversion. Do some parents force their kids to go to church? Sure, because they're human and humans aren't perfect. But where in any of the church's policies are people forced to believe things they want nothing to do with? No where. So your asinine statement of ""Must be SO nice to ignore all that"" is literally ridiculous. And then what? You say ""Yea but then theres this!"" Rinse and repeat. It NEVER ENDS. There is always one more twisted thing that someone brings up, and no matter how much time you spend explaining the actual context of those events, it results in, but ""you're still wrong because you're wrong."" 

It always returns to random declarations of ""you're wrong because this is exactly how I decided to paint your stance for you."" THIS is why I don't want to argue nitty gritty. It accomplishes NOTHING.",gyr5por,t1_gyr3cl2,[],0

I knew the pandemic was likely in January and certain in February.  By the time people were telling mainstream media to shut the fuck up and stop fearmongering (the first response), anyone following actual scientists knew the genome ended in 33 'A' bases and that platforms were being used to synthesize the virus so that it could be supplied to the CDC for distribution to vaccine labs MONTHS before the first case hit US shores.  This is the age of the Internet, people.  If you are ignorant, it is BY CHOICE.  The information is THERE.  You can read Bioarxiv.  You can read PubMed.  No it's not spoon-fed for a general audience, but that's because general audiences are garbage.  Stop with that shit.  Read primary sources only.  Report of a new study?  Fucking skip the bullshit article and pull the study itself.  Find the podcasts the authors have been on.  Send them an email if you have a question.  You would be astounded how reachable scientists are if you step to them with a legitimate query and not some slack-jawed 'but why didnt I know watching CNBC all day that pandemic was gonna happen?

They rely on getting grandfathered in when regulations hit so that it only affects their competition.  During Clinton's time in the presidency, his advisors suggested that things like public land and mining rights should be auctioned off to the highest bidder.  Nope.  No administration would take him up on that.  They give the public goods away for pennies to cronies.  Any time you hear ""privatization"", don't think 'oh cool capitalism', think 'oh, old school communism' because that's what it is, with government giving cronies the keys to infrastructure and resources built with public taxpayer money either for free or for almost no cost.  It's flat out theft, and they make stupid poor idiots cheer for it.  And then when the blizzard comes to Texas and they're facing a $10k power bill, they cry little babies.

A church spending millions of dollars combating gay marriage, which directly affects people who want nothing to do with their religion, is just one teeny tiny example here. They aren't dragging people to church and forcing them to take the sacrament, they're just changing the laws that allow people to live their own lives. Nothing wrong at all with that!! Give me a fucking break.  
Go ahead and explain the context of Joseph Smith marrying other men's wives. Or the fact that black people's skin is a curse from god. Or the thousands upon thousands of anachronisms found in the book of mormon. Or is that moving the goalposts too much for you? If your church constantly has myriad issues that can be brought up, that have to be explained away by context and ""errors of man...."" there is probably something wrong with the organization you are defending, no?

You can claim all day that I'm making ""unfounded"" arguments here, which is complete bullshit. Your argument goes back to ""Well there needs to be context! There was a REASON Joseph married 14 year old girls and other men's wives, you just don't understand god's reasoning!""  
Do you SERIOUSLY not see the issue with that way of thinking? It means the church can never be wrong, because of ""errors of man."" God is ALWAYS correct, it's his prophets, who he is supposed to be directly speaking to, that are the problem. MAYBE god should make it easier for his servants to understand his will instead of relying on special little feelings, no? But either way, you'll always excuse these issues because of ""god's plan,"" which no one can ever know until after they die and have no more influence on this planet. How CONVENIENT.  
Get out of here with your ""fallacies"" arguments. It's clear you think you know a lot, but for someone who knows as much as you do you REALLY ignore a lot of bullshit to feel better about yourself.  
But you know what? Maybe I am wrong. Maybe there IS a lustful, angry god who claims to love everyone, yet causes so many people in this life to suffer just for the crime of being born. Maybe there IS a god who created one true church on this planet, which only has .02% of the world's population as members. What a loving god, removing any sort of archeological evidence that could prove his church was true. How convenient, that the plates couldn't be seen by anyone else other than the ""witnesses,"" who are all very shady individuals themselves. But go ahead, trust the prophets.

If you’re waiting for the fed to move to become bearish you’re assuming there will be a market willing to take your stocks off your hands near the highs after they signal higher rates which I don’t think is possible. Stocks are so elevated across the board that there will be a continual attempt to sniff out any potential hawkishness from the fed and at best there will be routine sharp declines but I personally believe we’re going to get a complete flush soon given where stocks are.

So if we are part of a community dedicated to a particular stock, and that stock is a good BET(highly shorted, buy back, etc) in the short term, we shouldn’t post legitimately on WSB?

It is my understanding that the reason you would post here is too let the retail smooth-brained apes know something is happening. Don’t we need momentum, especially in a situation where the stock is being manipulated? Isn’t that gme, amc, mvis, rkt? To which I see posts non-stop when they are hot and experiencing a catalyst. 

I believe the post “upvote on wsb” you are referring to is a combination of trying to build momentum AND frustration from community members that their seemingly legitimate WSB Posts weren’t going live. I guess you could call that manipulation. Seems like a lot. 

Maybe I’m a complete dim wit, but it seems like overkill that this WSB problem is coming to a head this week, with this stock, with this potential. 

And I’m not speaking for everyone in the [community](r/uwmcshareholders) of note, but I’m pretty sure it was started as a place to obsess over a ticker separate from WSB for two reasons: 1) Courtesy-of course they wouldn’t expect WSB to be interested when there are no “bets” to be placed and 2) Create a niche community and be informed.

These companies do pay the same taxes, if not more than private citizens.  They pay not only property taxes upon the land they own, collect sales tax, pay one-half of the social security taxes, if they're profitable they'll pay income taxes and sales tax where applicable.

Often times, it's people who make poor choices such as choosing the electrical provider, the options or whether or not they allow privatization of power in TX.

Then if there's 8 more you'd complain there's only 11. Right, it never ends does it? Claims to fallacy are valid here and there are ample examples. And yea, suffering has to exist in a world where people have the freedom to choose. What kind of growth would anyone receive if no one experienced anything negative? You act like your worldview discredits the possibility of an entire religion. That's the kind of thinking I'm talking about. And yea obviously missionaries exist for a reason. If life is about learning to develop faith and learning to develop a personal relationship with God, what would be the point if someone could prove it? Do you really think an all powerful God couldn't just come down from heaven and post on twitter which church is right if thats what he wanted? How is it you claim to know so much and yet haven't figured out that that would defeat the entire purpose of being on this planet. 

And again the fact that there is a small population doesn't discredit anything. Jesus was a single person and when he did his thing, there were 12 people with him. What percentage of the world's population is that do you think? Just because you think that means God isn't really there doesn't mean God doesn't have a reason. Again, it is arrogant to assume that you've got it all figured out. 

And yes members of the church can do wrong. When did I say they cant? The church is made of imperfect people and to expect anything else is ridiculous. And yes, we can get into the context of blacks and the priesthood, and the mark of cain, and polygamy which is already found all over the old testament, but nothing would change. Seriously. No matter how much we delve into it, you'll insist that your account of the polygamy is correct and mine is manipulated because it is the account supported by the church. You could literally show all sorts of spurious sources and stay convinced that yours is valid and mine are not. No matter how convincingly I explain it, or how poorly I explain it, do you think in a million years it would change what you think? Absolutely not. I've been down this road, and it never ends. 

AND here's the clincher, that's not a discredit to you, despite what you think I think! That is the nature of material being misrepresented, twisted, convoluted and argued with or without context. The arguments for ""how do you find this acceptable"" is countered with an infinite depth of context for why it WAS acceptable. But it will never end because you will never accept those premises about the contexts of the time. It never ends. 

As for forcing people to believe things, you do realize that voting against gay marriage does not force anyone to believe anything? If anything it probably has the opposite effect.

So, depends on what you are invested in. Buying puts on tech and meme stocks will make you an absurd amount of money though, as some on here have already done and/or are doing. Myself included (puts on TSLA and gme I own/am scalping).

1550,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"At this point, it's too late for most of us to make any plays before earnings tomorrow, but let's get a few things clear.

1. Good earnings or not, short squeeze isn't happening. This reminds me a lot of a month or so ago when people were saying the same thing about $ASO. It was and still is a great buy, but it never squeezed. It's gain was purely fundamental. There is still not enough shorts being made compared to the amount of volume the stock trades daily. Volume is not good enough to warrant a spiking increase, which means there is less chance of a margin call occurring. Obviously, a whale could come in, but if it didn't happen for $ASO, I doubt it will happen here.
2. This might be a decent play either way. For bulls, this could be a discount $ASO repeat where we might see a, at least, $4 stock price increase over the next business week. The company has had nine quarters in row of revenue increase. That's impressive that the trend continued through COVID. Obviously, holiday sales will not be on this quarter's earnings, but if revenue kept going up, they are likely to still be a profitable brick and mortar company. Company also offers grooming services and is getting into vet business as well. Not to mention all their items are overpriced as hell. IE. Like $ASO this could be good long term hold.
3. Bears have obviously shorted the stock. Possible reasoning could be that for one, holidays are over, so sales could have gone down. Chewy is still growing in users and I would assume is $WOOF's number 1 competitor. From being in Petco's the regulars tend to be older, meaning it has an aging consumer base. An all online business like Chewy is much more ideal for the younger crowd, which means $WOOF might be on a ticking clock. Outside of convivence if you live by one and looking at little animals to buy, PETCO doesn't have much of an edge over Chewy, in my opinion.

TLDR: Wait till earnings tomorrow. There ain't going to be a short squeeze but I would like to buy puts if earnings are bad, shares if earnings are good. Hold for probably two weeks until the stock stabilizes in either direction. Volume isn't that high so once it stops moving, it's not moving till next quarter end.",gyrax8m,t3_ngj411,[],0

There is also the scope of intellectually property licensing and terms concerning supply and manufacture. When reading these provisions in the agreement together, it is clear that the strategy is to have OCGN use its position here in the US to (broker) find a Big Pharma strategic partner that will step-in and do the heavy lifting by sub-licensing the IP from OCGN. Neither Bharat biotech nor OCGN posses the capabilities to roll this vaccine out on a global basis. For now, both must leverage contract manufacturing orgs and will continue to do so until (and probably even after) a big strategic partnership can be formed w big pharma for world wide distribution. Coming back to EUA, the EUA submission will be the 1st attempt/shot-on-goal but it’s going to be a LONG SHOT that this vaccine gets EUA - it doesn’t mean it’ll never get approved but the FDA might say “nah do a phase 3 here in the US and seek a normal approval” in response to the submission- I will sell my calls when the EUA is submitted because I’m hoping that this alone will be a big catalyst; after that all bets are off,  literally.",gyrbh8s,t1_gyr8wxs,[],1

We’ve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17.  Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22.......

Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28.  If AMC goes on a similar slide to the March slide, there will be massive returns on these ridiculously cheap put options.",gyrbt2k,t3_ngfr58,['AMC'],0

I understand the idea of ""well, I already lost my ass, may as well let it ride"", but the reality is, that is how you lose even more.

Options can be brutal if they go tits up, and sure, I would hold damn near worthless contracts and live on a prayer, but I have learned not to get to that point (usually).  Sure, if you hold shares you can say that it isnt a loss until you sell.  But why hold a losing position on 'hope' (f*ck hope btw), when you can pivot elsewhere and possibly make up for losses?

> I meant no more government contracts for products and services from private companies

This would mean a totally self-sufficient Government to provide their own goods and.  

Your local Sheriff's Department (county Government) wouldn't be able to buy vehicles from Ford - or just off the lot?  Wrong color, and they'd have to do the repainting, wiring and manufacturing of radio equipment completely in house.

Your State needing aircraft for their National Guard would need to create their own, and of course become experts in the maintenance along the way - better than Cessna and Bell.  

Your Federal Government needing ships to ply the oceans wouldn't pay (or promise to pay) for the creation of those ships.  The transportation of foods for the troops, couldn't be contracted as a futures either, but would be JIT inventory to be delivered even in times of war.  

> no more regulations isolating markets

You would have a free-for-all market for power?  No FDA to control the quality of drugs (or ensuring the efficacy) nor would you even worry about the wild swings in currencies such as bitcoins?  A company could use non-GAAP standards for accounting as there would be no SEC to manage the markets?

I am a wee surprised to hear that an active member is unfamiliar with the Mormon teaching that homosexual relationships are a sin. That the only way someone who is gay is worthy of love from 'Mormon God' is if they give up an opportunity to love and be loved in an adult romantic relationship. That's not love. That's not acceptance. I'd love to provide any sources, is there something that seems particularly helpful? LDS church policy, conference talks, devotionals? Financial involvement in attempts (both successful and not) at anti-gay legislature? Are you familiar with LDS leadership's current stance on marriage for those of us in the LGBTQ community? 

As for the LDS faith being a high demand religion, the [BITE model](https://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/bite-model/) might be a good place to start. A few high-demand qualities that Mormonism fits: a living leader who claims divine nature and is accountable to no authority, high priority on retaining new members, requires unquestionable commitment, discourages doubt and questions, claims an exalted and elite status, guilt and shame tactics employed to retain membership, money is of high priority.

2. [Petrodollar Recycling](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sp032306a) is the number one source of demand for US dollars abroad and we have already passed peak oil, reinforcing point #1
3. Foreign guuuvvments have been buying and holding US dollars or Treasury debt (or both) and start dumping their debt.

Real estate not only holds its value, but it will likely see an acceleration in price appreciation when the S&P 500 corrects by 10 – 15%. Again, look at the bond performance chart above and think about it as a proxy for real estate price performance, depending on what type of real estate you own.  
My belief is that your primary residence will increase by 1-2 percentage points above its normal rate of appreciation when the S&P 500 corrects by about 10% – 15%.",gyrg9ls,t1_gyrflzw,[],1

I invested when they went public again back in January...not a lot, but I'm trying to pick stocks I think will go up and trying to learn by putting a little here are there and watching them. Figured this might be a long game play.

They have also made a lot of moves in the last handful of years to stay with the current times like same day delivery and curbside pickup, before the pandemic happened, from your local store. Stuff that other brick and mortar stores that died didn't embrace. Hoping that I made a good play.

As an alternative, if the OTM option premium is $0.50/share, that $800 can buy 16 contracts, for control of 1600 shares. If the contract goes into the money, maybe it's worth $1/share for a total value of $1600, profit of $800. More leverage, more potential profit for the same money.

3285,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the response and the well-wishes for peace. 

Church doctrine seems pretty clear that everyone is loved, no matter what their actions or beliefs. An example is that if someone doesn't attend church or read scriptures, they still deserve to be treated with love and compassion (even though the church teaches that we should partake of the sacrament and read our scriptures in our homes). Same thing goes for homosexual relationships. If someone is in one, they still deserve to be treated with love and compassion (even though the church teaches that you should not be in a homosexual relationship). Everyone who has ever existed is worthy of love from ""Mormon God"" and this is exactly what we teach.

Sorry if you misinterpreted my comments - I am well aware of what the church believes is and isn't a sin. If you read my replies again, you'll see that I was confused because I am not aware of any church leader telling members to *not* love those doing things that we believe are sins. I find it to be quite the contrary. However, if you can find a church policy, conference talk, social media post, or devotional from the Church saying that we should hate, discriminate, judge, or not love people based on if they are keeping the commandments or not, I would be interested to read it. Again, not that homosexuality is contrary to God's commandments (they are very clear that it is), but that we should hate, discriminate, judge, or not love someone because they are homosexual. That's just something I have never heard before.

As for the high demand religion, I definitely don't feel like the way I live my religion is demanding. Or that the church demands much of me. It adds a good structure to my life, giving me a good routine, good standards, and a good outlook on life. The way it's set up helps me know that I am included and loved, while giving me my personal space and time to ask questions and discover truths for myself.",gyrhjur,t1_gyrdvwj,[],1

FTR, there are at least two these for GME that aren't total trash. 

1. They have significant real estate holdings left over from the days when the company often bought the land their stores stood on. This is the original Michael Burry thesis for GME back when it was trading below $5, IIRC.

2. The company is trying to compete in the space that Newegg occupies by selling components to PC gamers online. GME is doing everything in their power to push graphics cards right now, but the supply shortages have created a weird situation.

You can argue for the short squeeze as a third thesis, but that seems to have lost some steam. 

My advice is simple: don't buy stocks you don't like. If you don't understand the company, try to buy as small and cheap as possible.

I had looked at GME in march of 2020 based on Burry's investments, but I passed on it. I opted to tail Burry on CLF at $3, and I haven't felt terrible about that play.",gyri2tz,t1_gyr88vl,['GME'],0

They brokered a deal with a European energy company and inherited some massive debt obligations to their retirees, then they were suffering because companies that were leasing their jets, which they were financing, backed out of their leases.  Then they started talking about the reverse split (8 to 1) and people went wild in a sell off and finally they sold off the aviation division (in part) to the Irish.    That was the a rough one as after the virus issues clear up that would have been profitable.  When I finally saw that their dividend was .01 per share I threw my paper hands up and said fuck it.

If calls go into money, the value goes up a lot (figure from $.50 to $2 in my example). That is slightly less than the full $2 per share from $8-10, but you have 16x as many, so you make a lot more.

You can see exponential returns if you get something for a low premium and it goes up. At a fraction of the share cost, you can also rachet up your number of shares.

Unlike stock, if you just buy options, you can at least limit your downside without having a stop loss that can get triggered and then the stock rockets without you.  


Selling options is a bit more tricky.  


OTOH you can't YOLO stock.  Like if I buy $100k of TSLA - it tanks, down 30%.  I still have $70k.  Of course I could use margin, but I'll keep getting margin called as it goes down, limiting my losses.  


Instead I buy $100k of calls, it tanks, I lose $100k.

Then Fannie et al securitize the loans and resell them in mortgage backed securities.

You're pushing a stock that has billions of shares outstanding. It will never happen like TSLA. Maybe you ride the dividend. Maybe it goes up from $12 to $13 in a month or two.  


The reason the stock went up on a percentage basis is because of how far it sunk at the beginning of the pandemic when folks didn't bother with cars because they weren't driving to work every day or going on vacation. So this is just a reversion to the normal.

We’ve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17.  Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22.......

Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28.  If AMC goes on a similar slide to the March slide, there will be massive returns on these ridiculously cheap put options.

7396,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"That’s exactly what I’m thinking. I found myself feeling a little bit of pressure today because I was out with a friend of mine and she basically told me every single thing down to her retirement about how her life is planned out, and what she’s going to be doing for her career, she even thinks she knows how she’s going to meet her wife. And she asked me what I want, what I’m going to do. And the only answer I could muster is that I’m going to keep working out and getting into better and better shape, and keep reading books that interest me and working with my therapist to become a better person. I don’t think I need to set a specific life plan because I’ve done that.

I mean, it’s not a joke when people say I went to clown school. I’ve toured. I’ve run art studios and taught classes but I’m also firmly of the belief that working in theatre is just a big fucking pyramid scheme. It’s not sustainable, and the people who have “made it” are the people teaching classes and at colleges and most of them are still barely scraping by. I thought if I suddenly found myself with a bunch of free time, I’d get back into writing (which I kind of have, if you include my reddit shitposting, but I don’t believe that’s very commercial)

But my honest belief? If I keep following my passions, taking classes, making smart trades, learning from people around me keeping my eyes and ears open to the periphery? I’ll find great things for myself and be able to live a life that I am satisfied with. I just don’t think it would be conducive to make a plan for the sake of *having a plan of something to do* because I’ve seen the misery those people I know who went to college to become actualized are in, and the struggle of my friends who refused to accept that what they thought they wanted to do when they were younger isn’t what they actually want to do.

I am using Tiger brokers (NYSE:TIGR).

The margin requirement for selling calls is dependent on the share price itself, so it moves. I am not sure about the exact requirements but it is somewhere along the lines of (share price\*100\*(IV / 2).

For example, AMC is at $10 with 200% IV, margin requirement per call would be 10\*100\*(200%) = $2000

During the post of thurs and pre of friday (I think?) where it went up 11% to $15, [I would have been margin called.](https://imgur.com/a/Nime90c) But luckily the broker couldn't call me on my options then :) and the market opened lower subsequently bringing me back to the margin.

These calls were not sold all at once, but I started selling them when $AMC was $10 (smooth brain moment) and kept averaging up until I ran out of margins.",gyrwrl4,t3_ng96co,['AMC'],1

It's like an MBA human pyramid of jackasses jacking off eachother. You hold yourself up by the two dicks in your hand and in turn your dick helps hold up another jackass mba.  Maybe it's a tower more than a pyramid, but you get the picture. Just jackass mbas doing reports for report sake all the time, six sigma, stack ranking, a million layers of middle management.

I have the feeling that they could get lucky and have an engineer invent, I don't know, a way to turn plastic into gold and they'd middle-manage it to death. Take anything I hate about corporate culture and look it up and I'll eventually read that it ""came from the GE school of management"".  Six sigma, not in manufacturing like Toyota, but as a cult practice with rewards for timing how long people take in the bathroom or saving water by putting timers on the drinking fountain. Bullshit for bullshit sake. Forced stack ranking where you have to punish the lowest performer on a winning team. Imagine the NBA firing the 10th best player of the NBA championship team every year. Forcing managers to rotate to learn different areas to develop this general arsenal of experience. That might work in a limited capacity, like a machine shop, but it's probably okay to have experts be experts. You don't need Tom Brady to be a line backer for a season.

Not to mention cooking the books, faking their business, putting short term profits ahead of not only safety but actual engineering and long term growth, hell long term income.

GE fucking sucks and like a cancer their fucking former loser executives spread out and infect other good companies with their cult of GE management bullshit.

GE will have to do a lot to get me to believe they're not going to continue to suck the life out of everything they touch. 

It might be a good investment despite their massive debt, lack of direction, and horrible toxic culture, because maybe they'll tap into the good ol' boys network and do what they did before, fake it really well and take corporate welfare in the form of government contracts.

And maybe, like you said, one ceo will be enough to actually change that place. 

But I won't be expecting much and personally, I think we'll all be better off if they fail and the business world writes a post-mortem on a lot of their ""best practices"".

Here's a nice article from a couple years ago. Maybe it's better, but this is partly why people hate it like the plague. If you've ever had a GE guy come ruin your company and your life, you'll hate it too.

Short term I could see a 20% swing in either direction before Friday expiration and not be shocked, especially with how much it has swung lately.

It isn't a horrible play and those calls are well out of the money but well we'll see if he gets called.

After that market will react negatively to anything the fed says. Fed will either say it’s transitory and they’re still not worried and then market will freak out because nobody believes the transitory story. Or they acknowledge inflation concern and market will freak out that rates might be increased sooner than than expected. It’s just a lose-lose situation.
