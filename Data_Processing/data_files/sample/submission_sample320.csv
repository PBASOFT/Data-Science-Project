109,2021-05-28,stocks,"I’ll keep it simple. 
As of now the only way Russians can buy spce is from the St Petersburg exchange. St Petersburg is known to buy company stocks and re-sell them without the permission of the company… 

April 2018: 
“Under Russian securities laws, a Russian stock exchange can unilaterally admit foreign securities to trading without the consent of the issuer of such securities. In the last several years, the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange admitted securities of a number of foreign companies to trading in a similar fashion.”

So big investors don’t trade there for that reason.. they could be forced to sell their shares, and when they buy shares they have to pay “extra” on them. Our Russian friends always complain about the stock price, when they try to buy we post one number… they see another “higher to buy” lower to sell etc… because of a “delay”.

Anyways, if you noticed during the flight many Russian investors attended the after party of SPCE. Then days later SPCE announced they’ll officially list in the Moscow exchange. 

Is this a coincidence? No. Russian investors are interested in this company, next week we will see “fresh” money buying shares and holding them. 

We will see a difference, just watch!",nmzbs7,['SPCE'],0

Among the sea of shitposts, memes, gain and loss porn, Wallstreetbets also has some of the best DD I have ever read. From $PRPL, to steel gang, to $GME and beyond, there has been a wealth of incredible DDs on WSB. Unfortunately, there are two issues with DD posted on WSB:

- It is easy to miss the high quality DD among the memes and shitposts
- Once a post has reached the front page and gained thousands of upvotes, the ticker being recommended may already have seen the implied vol on call options shoot up enormously. Sometimes, depending on the ticker, the popularity of a DD post may even move the stock price itself.

Given the wealth of information contained in these DD posts, it would be useful to have an alert system to inform whether a new DD post has been created, and particularly, one that is perceived to be of high enough quality to reach the front page through Reddit's upvote system. 

# My Solution: a Python WSB DD scraper and alert system

I built a Python tool that scrapes WSB every 5 minutes throughout the day and searches through posts which are flaired as ""DD"" and are 30-35 minutes old. Several pieces of information are extracted from those posts, such as their score, the authors' karma, average comment sentiment, as well as a couple engineered features. This information is stored in a dataframe which contains all the day's DD posts. The user can elect to receive email alerts if one of those DD posts reaches the front page (defined as the top 25 posts when sorted under ""Hot""). In addition, the user has the ability to include a model to predict which posts will reach the front page in advance based on the features being scraped. If included, the tool will send email alert when a post is scraped which has a high probability of reaching the front page.

If interested, you can access the code here:
https://github.com/CuriousByNature/WSBFrontPageAlert

The README has a full set of instructions for executing the code. The repository also comes with a sample model object trained to predict whether posts will reach the front page using only on one of my engineered features. The model is able to make predictions with just under 90% out-of-sample precision.

358,2021-05-28,stocks,"Hello everyone,

I am posting here since it was removed from [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/). I apologize to the mods if this is the right content for this sub.

With the popularity of stock trading at an all-time high, I just wanted to give a small PSA and a note about my experience joining stock trading groups on discord.

Long story short, I have searched around a few different discords to join a community I could learn more about stocks and trading. I can say without a doubt, that the vast majority of them have the following scheme attached to it:

1. Are pump and dumps where the admin, claiming to be an expert, will post a daily watchlist to encourage people to buy into stocks they already have a position in.
2. Are setup to convince people they need to subscribe to daily video and ""secret advice"" in order to make a quick buck.

Some of the people that run these discords are competent and I can see use manipulation tactics to come off as an authority on subject matters and encourage group think to forward the two objectives above. If you understand and learn the fundamentals of investing, you can tell they lack substance, but people green to investing can easily be enticed.

Be careful and research into communities you plan on joining. A few common red flags of toxic stock discords I have found include:

1. Stocks recommendations that constantly change on a daily basis.
2. Cult-like praise for public figures like Elon Musk.
3. Using words and tactics to encourage group-think (Such as ""stock fam"" and encouraging the posting of daily profits).
4. Due diligence that amounts to ""This company looks dope, they have a cool product,"" or ""Their product is the future"" without providing any knowledge of fundamentals, such as finance and balance sheet.

This may sound silly, but there are people out there who are looking to capitalize hard on this craze. Some will come off as smart and can be charismatic. If you haven't read into the fundamentals of finance and investing, their advice looks very enticing.

If you are looking for a community to join, be careful and always scrutinize people's suggestions.",nn1f5a,[],1

The dividend will be payable on July 1, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 15, 2021.
