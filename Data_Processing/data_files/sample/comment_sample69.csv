BUT this is also part of the issue ‚Äì after the whole ‚Äústock market drop‚Äù happened, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm suddenly secondary! He‚Äôs determined to take advantage of the market while it‚Äôs down. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs even made $100 on stocks yet, but that‚Äôs clearly not stopping him. 


All he can talk about right now is ‚Äúvolatility,‚Äù ‚Äúprivate equity‚Äù and ‚Äúmaking gains.‚Äù Honestly, I‚Äôm pretty sure most of the stuff he‚Äôs been saying is just quoted from ‚ÄúThe Wolf of Wall Street,‚Äù but I don‚Äôt wanna start anything by calling him out on it. 


The worst part was when we were in bed together. I was nice and cozy, and I thought he was too, until I looked over my shoulder and saw that he was on his phone the whole time. At 9 a.m., while PRETENDING to cuddle with me, this guy was buying stock, literally behind my back. 


When I called him out on it he just said ‚Äúbuy low sell high, baby‚Äù and gave me finger guns. Finger guns, in bed. 


I genuinely don‚Äôt know whether this is just a phase, or if he‚Äôs actually just like this all the time. I totally understand that money management is important, and I think it‚Äôs cool that he cares about personal finance, but this is clearly getting out of hand, right? Help!",[],1

Do you have any options to make an appointment with someone at the VA to help with anxiety and your current mental state? That would be my first step. Get off the internet and get some sleep. Make sure you are drinking water and getting at least something to eat. Then make an appointment tomorrow. After appointment for that is made then see what avenues you have for seeing someone to help you with the short term financially. Hopefully the VA has some option for guidance on that.

But the likelihood of everyone holding til it got that high is definitely low. People will start folding if it hits $500. I think 500-3k is realistic.

242,gynqbqo,2021-05-19,t1_gynqau2,wallstreetbets,"In bed I‚Äôm wearing Ralph Lauren silk pajamas and when I get up I slip on a paisley ancient madder robe and walk to the bathroom. I urinate while trying to make out the puffiness of my reflection in the glass that encases a baseball poster hung above the toilet. After I change into Ralph Lauren monogrammed boxer shorts and a Fair Isle sweater and slide into silk polka-dot Enrico Hidolin slippers I tie a plastic ice pack around my face and commence with the morning‚Äôs stretching exercises. Afterwards I stand in front of a chrome and acrylic Washmobile bathroom sink‚Äîwith soap dish, cup holder, and railings that serve as towel bars, which I bought at Hastings Tile to use while the marble sinks I ordered from Finland are being sanded‚Äîand stare at my reflection with the ice pack still on. I pour some Plax antiplaque formula into a stainless-steel tumbler and swish it around my mouth for thirty seconds. Then I squeeze Rembrandt onto a faux-tortoiseshell toothbrush and start brushing my teeth (too hung over to floss properly‚Äîbut maybe I flossed before bed last night?) and rinse with Listerine. Then I inspect my hands and use a nailbrush. I take the ice-pack mask off and use a deep-pore cleanser lotion, then an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for ten minutes while I check my toenails. Then I use the Probright tooth polisher and next the Interplak tooth polisher (this in addition to the toothbrush) which has a speed of 4200 rpm and reverses direction forty-six times per second; the larger tufts clean between teeth and massage the gums while the short ones scrub the tooth surfaces. I rinse again, with Cepacol. I wash the facial massage off with a spearmint face scrub. The shower has a universal all-directional shower head that adjusts within a thirty-inch vertical range. It‚Äôs made from Australian gold-black brass and covered with a white enamel finish. In the shower I use first a water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Vidal Sassoon shampoo is especially good at getting rid of the coating of dried perspiration, salts, oils, airborne pollutants and dirt that can weigh down hair and flatten it to the scalp which can make you look older. The conditioner is also good‚Äîsilicone technology permits conditioning benefits without weighing down the hair which can also make you look older. On weekends or before a date I prefer to use the Greune Natural Revitalizing Shampoo, the conditioner and the Nutrient Complex. These are formulas that contain D-panthenol, a vitamin-B-complex factor; polysorbate 80, a cleansing agent for the scalp; and natural herbs. Over the weekend I plan to go to Bloomingdale‚Äôs or Bergdorf‚Äôs and on Evelyn‚Äôs advice pick up a Foltene European Supplement and Shampoo for thinning hair which contains complex carbohydrates that penetrate the hair shafts for improved strength and shine. Also the Vivagen Hair Enrichment Treatment, a new Redken product that prevents mineral deposits and prolongs the life cycle of hair. Luis Carruthers recommended the Aramis Nutriplexx system, a nutrient complex that helps increase circulation. Once out of the shower and toweled dry I put the Ralph Lauren boxers back on and before applying the Mousse A Raiser, a shaving cream by Pour Hommes, I press a hot towel against my face for two minutes to soften abrasive beard hair. Then I always slather on a moisturizer (to my taste, Clinique) and let it soak in for a minute. You can rinse it off or keep it on and apply a shaving cream over it‚Äîpreferably with a brush, which softens the beard as it lifts the whiskers‚Äîwhich I‚Äôve found makes removing the hair easier. It also helps prevent water from evaporating and reduces friction between your skin and the blade. Always wet the razor with warm water before shaving and shave in the direction the beard grows, pressing gently on the skin. Leave the sideburns and chin for last, since these whiskers are tougher and need more time to soften. Rinse the razor and shake off any excess water before starting. Afterwards splash cool water on the face to remove any trace of lather. You should use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol. Never use cologne on your face, since the high alcohol content dries your face out and makes you look older. One should use an alcohol-free antibacterial toner with a water-moistened cotton ball to normalize the skin. Applying a moisturizer is the final step. Splash on water before applying an emollient lotion to soften the skin and seal in the moisture. Next apply Gel Appaisant, also made by Pour Hommes, which is an excellent, soothing skin lotion. If the face seems dry and flaky‚Äîwhich makes it look dull and older‚Äîuse a clarifying lotion that removes flakes and uncovers fine skin (it can also make your tan look darker). Then apply an anti-aging eye balm (Baume Des Yeux) followed by a final moisturizing ‚Äúprotective‚Äù lotion. A scalpprogramming lotion is used after I towel my hair dry. I also lightly blow-dry the hair to give it body and control (but without stickiness) and then add more of the lotion, shaping it with a Kent natural-bristle brush, and finally slick it back with a wide-tooth comb. I pull the Fair Isle sweater back on and reslip my feet into the polka-dot silk slippers, then head into the living room and put the new Talking Heads in the CD player, but it starts to digitally skip so I take it out and put in a CD laser lens cleaner.

You have classics like Dune, Three Body Problem, Foundations, and 2001.

If you are more into 'Serinity' style scifi try Galaxy Outlaws.  It reads/listens like a show rather than a regular novel.  Great for commutes, the gym, or a bike ride.  

If you like cheese, try Yahtzee's Will Save the Galaxy series.  Depends alot on how much you like his humor, but I enjoy it.

Altered Carbon (the book/audiobook) is good.  Less space adventure and more cyberpunk/bladerunner

If you like more ""near future"" stuff try Andy Weir's books like the Martian and Artemis

Children of Time is good but a stand alone book, no series


There are alot more so check out Good Reads for (arguably better) recommendations.  

Oh: while its not typical scifi, i just reread The Fall of Rapture, the prequel novel to Bioshock 1.  Its pretty great, even if you never played the games.  If you have played then getting a pre-everything goes to shit view of Rapture and the people who come there is fun.",[],1

Bizjets are generally profitable. However, they're still carrying a debt sized for the Bombardier of old (with commercial aircraft, the rail division, flight training, and other business units), and now have *only* the bizjet division left to handle paying it off.

I can see it going up, but the risk is pretty unfavourable IMO - ~$10B debt, 3.6B from the Alstom deal of which 600m was Alstom stock, and $1.8B existing cash on hand at the time of reporting. So net 4.6B in liabilities, and still struggling to turn a profit.

405,gynqt3g,2021-05-19,t1_gynqh75,wallstreetbets,"In bed I‚Äôm wearing Ralph Lauren silk pajamas and when I get up I slip on a paisley ancient madder robe and walk to the bathroom. I urinate while trying to make out the puffiness of my reflection in the glass that encases a baseball poster hung above the toilet. After I change into Ralph Lauren monogrammed boxer shorts and a Fair Isle sweater and slide into silk polka-dot Enrico Hidolin slippers I tie a plastic ice pack around my face and commence with the morning‚Äôs stretching exercises. Afterwards I stand in front of a chrome and acrylic Washmobile bathroom sink‚Äîwith soap dish, cup holder, and railings that serve as towel bars, which I bought at Hastings Tile to use while the marble sinks I ordered from Finland are being sanded‚Äîand stare at my reflection with the ice pack still on. I pour some Plax antiplaque formula into a stainless-steel tumbler and swish it around my mouth for thirty seconds. Then I squeeze Rembrandt onto a faux-tortoiseshell toothbrush and start brushing my teeth (too hung over to floss properly‚Äîbut maybe I flossed before bed last night?) and rinse with Listerine. Then I inspect my hands and use a nailbrush. I take the ice-pack mask off and use a deep-pore cleanser lotion, then an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for ten minutes while I check my toenails. Then I use the Probright tooth polisher and next the Interplak tooth polisher (this in addition to the toothbrush) which has a speed of 4200 rpm and reverses direction forty-six times per second; the larger tufts clean between teeth and massage the gums while the short ones scrub the tooth surfaces. I rinse again, with Cepacol. I wash the facial massage off with a spearmint face scrub. The shower has a universal all-directional shower head that adjusts within a thirty-inch vertical range. It‚Äôs made from Australian gold-black brass and covered with a white enamel finish. In the shower I use first a water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Vidal Sassoon shampoo is especially good at getting rid of the coating of dried perspiration, salts, oils, airborne pollutants and dirt that can weigh down hair and flatten it to the scalp which can make you look older. The conditioner is also good‚Äîsilicone technology permits conditioning benefits without weighing down the hair which can also make you look older. On weekends or before a date I prefer to use the Greune Natural Revitalizing Shampoo, the conditioner and the Nutrient Complex. These are formulas that contain D-panthenol, a vitamin-B-complex factor; polysorbate 80, a cleansing agent for the scalp; and natural herbs. Over the weekend I plan to go to Bloomingdale‚Äôs or Bergdorf‚Äôs and on Evelyn‚Äôs advice pick up a Foltene European Supplement and Shampoo for thinning hair which contains complex carbohydrates that penetrate the hair shafts for improved strength and shine. Also the Vivagen Hair Enrichment Treatment, a new Redken product that prevents mineral deposits and prolongs the life cycle of hair. Luis Carruthers recommended the Aramis Nutriplexx system, a nutrient complex that helps increase circulation. Once out of the shower and toweled dry I put the Ralph Lauren boxers back on and before applying the Mousse A Raiser, a shaving cream by Pour Hommes, I press a hot towel against my face for two minutes to soften abrasive beard hair. Then I always slather on a moisturizer (to my taste, Clinique) and let it soak in for a minute. You can rinse it off or keep it on and apply a shaving cream over it‚Äîpreferably with a brush, which softens the beard as it lifts the whiskers‚Äîwhich I‚Äôve found makes removing the hair easier. It also helps prevent water from evaporating and reduces friction between your skin and the blade. Always wet the razor with warm water before shaving and shave in the direction the beard grows, pressing gently on the skin. Leave the sideburns and chin for last, since these whiskers are tougher and need more time to soften. Rinse the razor and shake off any excess water before starting. Afterwards splash cool water on the face to remove any trace of lather. You should use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol. Never use cologne on your face, since the high alcohol content dries your face out and makes you look older. One should use an alcohol-free antibacterial toner with a water-moistened cotton ball to normalize the skin. Applying a moisturizer is the final step. Splash on water before applying an emollient lotion to soften the skin and seal in the moisture. Next apply Gel Appaisant, also made by Pour Hommes, which is an excellent, soothing skin lotion. If the face seems dry and flaky‚Äîwhich makes it look dull and older‚Äîuse a clarifying lotion that removes flakes and uncovers fine skin (it can also make your tan look darker). Then apply an anti-aging eye balm (Baume Des Yeux) followed by a final moisturizing ‚Äúprotective‚Äù lotion. A scalpprogramming lotion is used after I towel my hair dry. I also lightly blow-dry the hair to give it body and control (but without stickiness) and then add more of the lotion, shaping it with a Kent natural-bristle brush, and finally slick it back with a wide-tooth comb. I pull the Fair Isle sweater back on and reslip my feet into the polka-dot silk slippers, then head into the living room and put the new Talking Heads in the CD player, but it starts to digitally skip so I take it out and put in a CD laser lens cleaner.

People often buy more expensive and luxurious goods than previously. That's not inflation but instead a change in taste to something better. Consider for example, in California the average home prices have risen, its true... But these aren't the same homes of 2011 or 2001 or 1991. These homes are bigger, with more luxurious bathrooms and kitchens. They don't build inexpensive housing because people aren't buying the inexpensive stuff. They want the fancy stuff.  


By changing the basket of goods the way you have, you are incorporating society's change in tastes and preference into your measurement, which is not inflation, rather than increase in price for the same exact goods, which is inflation.

This is an article that talks about the Church's financial history and current financial situation.

And excerpt from it about the for profit aspect:

>Today, the Church‚Äôs business assets support the Church‚Äôs mission and principles by serving as a rainy day fund. Agricultural holdings now operated as for-profit enterprises can be converted into welfare farms in the event of a global food crisis. Companies such as KSL Television and the Deseret News provide strategically valuable communication tools.

The ""Church's mission"" is vague to those who aren't familiar with the Church's teachings but suffice it to say it's essentially to help spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ and help others when they are in need.

And a small list of 5 things that tithing and other donations are used for:
> Tithing funds are used to support five key areas of activity:

>1. Providing buildings or places of worship for members around the world. We have thousands of such buildings and continue to open more, sometimes several in a week.


>2. Providing education programs, including support for our universities and our seminary and institute programs.


>3. Supporting the Church‚Äôs worldwide missionary program.


>4. Building and operating nearly 140 temples around the world and the administration of the world‚Äôs largest family history program.


>5. Supporting the Church‚Äôs welfare programs and humanitarian aid, which serve people around the world ‚Äî both members of the Church as well as those who are not members.",[],1

I know what it feels like to feel so hopeless and like there‚Äôs such a mountain to climb that any little bit of work feels fruitless because it‚Äôs just a drop in the bucket. The thing with drops in the bucket of work though (and really anything) is that progress is always being made no matter how gradual it is. 

Tomorrow you need to go to work and stay there. You need to do this for your kids. You CAN do this. Your depression is the devil on your shoulder telling you to give in and that you‚Äôre a piece of shit. You tell that devil to fuck the fuck off. Your depression and anxiety make us feel like we aren‚Äôt the ones in control, but we are. It doesn‚Äôt mean we can control everything, but it does mean that we can handle the next five minutes in front of us. When that five minutes is up then it‚Äôs into the next five minutes. That‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs the game. 

Go to sleep now. Go to work tomorrow. Come home when you are done with work (not before no matter how much it hurts to stay there - you need the money). When you come home make a list of unnecessary expenses you can get rid of and possessions that you guys can sell on FB Marketplace or similar. Focus on making it to Friday. Whatever you can figure to scrounge up. Then after Friday is over you can regroup to figure out where to go next. That may mean getting a new psychiatrist or switching your psychiatrist to med management only and finding a therapist you click with and can help you with therapy that is actually going to stick.

The TA is a method of analysis, that allows to filter out the market noise and to look at the things unbiased to the market sentiment, especially when such a sentiment is distorted. Remember when there was a bullish craze throughout the beginning of COVID, and everyone was talking about its insignificance, and how the stonks will only go up? Well, the market crash happened afterwards, and many fundamental and sentiment based ANALysts got burnt. While simultaneously TA indicators were shouting that the market was overbought, and the correction is due. Similarly, when everyone was panicking in late March 2020 and the general sentiment was grim, the indicators gave a hint that the many markets were oversold. Anyway, TA is a method, an instrument - and it depends on how you use it. If it doesn‚Äôt suit you, there is no need to run around and shout at everybody, criticising their instrument of preference.

Sixteen analysts who offered stock ratings for Baidu in the last three months forecast the average price in 12 months of $351.36 with a high forecast of $407.00 and a low forecast of $280.00.

The average price target represents an 82.34% increase from the last price of $192.70. Of those 16 analysts, 14 rated ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù, two rated ‚ÄúHold‚Äù while none rated ‚ÄúSell‚Äù, according to Tipranks.

Morgan Stanley gave the base target price to $300 with a high of $390 under a bull scenario and $160 under the worst-case scenario. The firm gave an ‚ÄúEqual-weight‚Äù rating on the Chinese Internet giant‚Äôs stock.

‚ÄúBaidu has provided better disclosure and has struck a constructive tone on its AI initiatives. We find it well-positioned in certain industrial applications. We also like its rich cash position and strategic investments,‚Äù noted Gary Yu, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

‚ÄúOur price target reflects materialization of AI investments, but we highlight milder near-term growth vs. peers amid risks from the competition. The company is well-positioned to ride the next Internet wave, but patience is needed. Our price target implies 18x consensus 2022e non-GAAP P/E vs. the historical 11-24x trading band since 2019.‚Äù

Several other analysts have also updated their stock outlook. CFRA cut the target price by $58 to $190. Loop Capital raised the price objective to $290 from $210. Baidu had its target price boosted by equities research analysts at Goldman Sachs to $385 from $383. Citigroup upped their target price on shares of Baidu to $324 from $292.",['AI'],0

1299,gynsul2,2021-05-19,t3_nfaizr,wallstreetbets,"For the new to catch up on the AMC/GME story, here is my 2 cents interpretation of what I see.   
The Stock Market is basically a Prey hunting trapping game and as I see it goes like this:  
The big guys goes on scavenger hunt and then they zero on a prey target. The company needs to have some interest in their stock. The hunters start to throw foods on the road to attract the prey to dip their toes in the water and have some confidence their shares are growing.  
Increasing the share prices would increase investors (prey) attraction to invest more.   
Then the hunters ask the Market Manipulators to create huge amount of Put options and Call options to make them gain/loss neutral and cover their tracks.  
  
Then the Hunters lend the synthetic shares they created and the short selling begins not at high volume yet, because the goal is to keep selling as much as investors prey keeps on buying. The Prey collects the sold money to grow even larger and more powerful to replicate the plan with other stocks and continue to repeat the trap.  
  
Once they decide that the prey eat enough shares and trapped, hunters flood the market relentlessly of those synthetic shares that appears legit since it is backed by Option put/call. Certainly, some borrowing of the real shares take place as well as that is also part of the trap cover-up to deceive the prey.   
  
Part of the decoy system are Media Bashers, false news manipulators, buying and selling outside the market ‚ÄúBlackpool‚Äù out of shore tradings, fake analysis, bought/bribed regulators and authorities etc.   
  
In short, provide unlimited supply to achieve the target goal of the most favored outcome of driving the company to bankruptcy or at the most to purchase the borrowed and synthetic shares at a much lower rate than the fund collected selling them. Then the regulators may fine the Manipulators a very tinny percentage as a ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù which is tinny skin out of the entire prey.  
  
So historically, the smart prey try to interpret charts and fundamentals which basically buys when the enemy is looking the other way or when the enemy is setting the crumbs on the road to trap the prey then as soon the big trap gets closer, sell and sheer the profit.   
  
Another Prey coping tactics has been is to buy options as much as they can afford to lose and for a short chance.   
  
Another prey coping mechanism is that when they get trapped to return bleeding with broken hopes accepting that this time they miscalculated and go on with less goals in life.  
However, this time is different. The prey decided to turn into Apes and bond worldwide against their aggressors. Apes now start eating the dangled food the aggressors left on the way with courage. Apes realized all food anywhere can be turned into a hidden trap and cost them to get hunted swiftly and decided to focus on one GME and AMC trap food the aggressors set for them. Now the prey trapped the aggressor not as a form of becoming a new aggressor, but as a duty and a right to defend one‚Äôs own life, family and belongings against the aggressors even if it means bankrupting the aggressor and even jailing them as they have committed robing and stealing in the trillion of wealth against the majority of the people of good well everywhere.   
  
Because the aggressors have done it over and over with great success, Apes must tough it out and stand their ground against the aggressor with resolute.   
  
Now, for me as long as the aggressors are covering with new synthetic shares is not the squeeze at all. The real squeeze is when the manufacturers of the synthetic shares are forced to purchase them at any price the seller determined and born those synthetic shares and every borrowed shares there is. Uncovered borrowed share is a naked share that dilute the market and loot investors.  
  
This is my opinion and not any financial advice as all I see is a game of hunting","['GME', 'AMC']",0

Rates go down, home prices go up and vice versa. This is because people buy what they can afford, in other words, their max payment. So when home prices rise but rates go down, their max payment stays the same, but they can afford to pay more. Measuring a change in average housing payment would be a better measure of inflation in housing than measuring home price, because the change in home price is exaggerated by the drop in interest rates. But again, then you've also got the change in tastes and quality to deal with in housing. I would say you could measure specific neighborhoods and see what the average payment is for a home in that neighborhood, but then it doesn't factor in depreciation of the houses as they age. Idk housing seems like the worst and hardest way to measure inflation. There's too many factors to account for.

the thing is, though, that people play very different when there's no real money involved. if you can, I'd suggest playing online micro-stakes. even playing $0.02/$0.05 stakes, people tend to play fairly ""real"". real enough to get the feel for it, at least.
also, start watching some poker content. specifically, good vloggers. you start to get a feel for how to analyze a hand, even if you aren't good enough to follow their line of thinking yet. they'll also expose you to tools you should become familiar with, like preflop charts.
if you wanna go deeper, Daniel Negreanu (the winningest poker player of all time iirc) did a ""masterclass"" on poker. it covers everything from playing an actual hand, to tournament strategy and bankroll management. you can torrent it for free, it's otherwise kinda expensive.

For reference, to be in the top 1% it's ~$4.5M totally wealth. Bezos is ~$190B... so crossing the line into the top 1% wealthiest Americans leaves you equally as close to someone with ~$100 in totally wealth as Jeff Bezos...

All across Asia, Latin America, Africa, and Europe, there have been an increase in cases. This is what DARPA has been preparing for years with the goal of delivering powerful new defenses against public health and national security threats. This is where Sorrento and ANP technologies comes into play. On February 24, 2021, Sorrento Therapeutics announced the acquisition of ANP technologies. ANP previously served as the Research and Development laboratory for the Joint Service Agent Water Monitor program. During this period. ANP has developed highly sensitive assays for the point detection of biological warfare agents and environmental contaminants in water borne samples. Because of the NIDS proprietary technologies, ANP handheld assays are typically 5-100x more sensitive than other assays of the same format due o the nanomanipulation technology which orients the binding proteins or antibodies optimally, thus dramatically increasing sensitivity and more importantly- completely eliminating the Hook Effect, a deadly false negative result when testing highly concentrated samples. These technologies allow for the rapid assembly and testing of assays against new targets, particularly emerging threats with prototype assays typically being available wthin a short period of time after receipt of anitbodies against the target of interest. Under the proposed effort, ANP will develop rapid, heat stable handheld lateral flow immunoassays utilizing thermally stable recombinant proteins provided by the govenment with ANP's  Nano-Intelligent Detection System(NIDS) platform technology to quickly detect various biological targets, particularly those emerging biothreats for which no highly stable, rapid (15 minute) point-detection platform is available. As the head of DARPA said on a 60 minutes segment last month, ""They don't just give money, and wait for you to some day comeback to them with something, but keep a very close watch."" DARPA is also working with Sorrento on developing Covi-AMG and Covi-Drops, vacci-body therapeutics. These can act as a treatment, booster, and vaccine. The DARPA contract supports the accelerated development of a Gene monoclonal antibody(GMAB) neutralizing antibody that can be delivered by a simple intramuscular injection, enabling the recipient to produce the protective antibody, potentially within 12 hours to a few days upon administration. This would be ideal for the military, and in an outpatient setting for Covid patients. #BullishAF",[],1

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

From my perspective I dont see the 10% as a negative thing.  It's something that reminds me that money isn't the most important thing in life.  Sure I need it to survive.  But I've also found that being engaged in good causes that are bigger than myself actually do more for me than say 10% of my income.  That's how I feel about it, and I'm not saying you should feel the same way.  Maybe I'm brainwashed or abused as some might think.  As for keeping the money local,  I dont agree.  If the church feels like building temples and chapels in say Africa where members donations would never amount to enough to pay for those, I am totally fine with my donations going to Africa to pay for a chapel there or anywhere else it's needed.

As far as why the church doesn't disclose its finances.  I'd guess it's for places like this thread, where people think they understand but they really don't.  And I don't mean that in a rude way.  But disclosing the amount of money invested in each type of asset doesn't tell anybody what the goals of the church are with that money, why it's there, and why it needs to stay there, or why it needs to be used for this or that.  It just doesn't give anybody the full picture.  I dont think it'd change any minds on the matter.  The only people who are really going to understand the finances are the ones making financial projections and goals for the future.  I dont know if the amount of money the church has is right or wrong.  Or if they are doing the most good with what they have.  I dont feel like I'm qualified to say whether the church does enough to be honest. 

Good discussion, sorry if I came off wrong in my first response.  I guess I get a little annoyed when it seems like people look for every reason to find fault in someone or something.  And sorry if that's not what you were doing.",[],0

Having spoken to ex employees( short lived employment), it is clear that the company is full of cheerleaders, technically incompetent and lazy individuals.

Aside, I m glad that this is an American company embarking on new technology.  

The reality is that LM needs to work on building its core management and technical leadership.  They are at this point far from that level.  

 To excel in this market, you need smart and dedicated engineers, capable technicians and assembly workers and above average management.   Lacking this , the product ideas and implementation on all level-software, electrical, mechanical, manufacturing is impossible.  Products are not ready, income is missing and market reacts. Right now, LM cannot convince investors that they can deliver.

The fact is that many tickers beside RIDE lost  on its value in past 5 months.  There are too many companies on the market that produce nothing but promises, have zero sales and rely on stock price up-down cycles to make up income.

Too many retail investors ask what happened with their investments.   They ask why are their chosen picks losing value.  Well... Managements issued shares.  In 2020, many tickers had increase in share prices.  Lacking sales and contracts, managements in conjunction with brokerage and investment firms are now selling shares they issued which results in price downtrend.  As the prices recover, managements are buying shares back, just to sell shares at higher prices some time later.  Rinse and repeat-to pay for labor, supplies, services, etc.  Yes...managements who issued their own stocks are shorting (and longing) independently or in cooperation with large funds.

In a nutshell, the stock market is keeping all these 0 cars EV, make a promise pharma and other companies alive.  Who cares-it's the modern economy after all.  On the top of that add large investment firms who cycle the buy -sell activity as their profit appetite desires....  The equilibrium is somewhere in the middle, a resultant of desires and targets of all players-large and small.

If any investor or trades think that some entity is after his shares, it is most likely the founder and/or management of the very company an investor invested in.",[],0

LONGS: 

EUROPE: Quality European companies as a whole trading way cheaper to the US little exposure to tech. 

-European Banks; HSBC, UBS, Barclays,  NatWest even CS. 

-European Energy; BP, Shell, COP etc. 

-CHINA; their equivalent to the SPY the MCHI.  China already underwent a decent correction, set a new base and will start running again.  The ETF‚Äôs will work or pick and of the quality beaten up ones; JD, BABA, BIDU, XPEV

I admit there‚Äôs logistic improvements that can be made and better content/merchant screening and responsibility but it‚Äôs all part of growing pains. I‚Äôve ordered from them before and all but one time did I receive the wrong item. And besides who said you can‚Äôt find dildos on amazon or eBay, doesn‚Äôt make it a scam. 

But I think wish is misunderstood, especially since the founders are so technical I think wish should be viewed more as a tech company than just e-commerce. IMHO Wish‚Äôs true value is its marketing algorithms and use of data & relevancy, and I think it‚Äôs really misunderstood because everyone associated it with Chinese crap. I mean who doesn‚Äôt own something from China?? But imagine how they‚Äôre able to achieve such revenue and GMV numbers, especially if they‚Äôre selling cheap crap from China which I can probably assume has a low transaction value on average. That means to make $2-3bn in revenue, imagine the level of volume of transactions on their platform and number of packages being shipped daily. This company‚Äôs technology can literally sell you shit from China over and over again and make billions in revenue with decent growth year over year. That, IMO, isn‚Äôt fuken easy. It‚Äôs not perfect since I know s&m cost needs to be contained, but it‚Äôs part of maturing their tech/business. But they prove their tech can sell ‚Äújunk‚Äù, it can find the right buyers in the right country with the right pocket cash to spend on something from china. I know it sounds ridiculous but I mean if you can make billions by getting people to repeatedly buy crap straight from China, imagine what else they can do down the road. 

TLDR; IMO I think Wish has growing pains but they got cash and tech to improve. I think their technology is the real value here and e-commerce is just medium to show off how powerful their marketing tech is, which will open doors to more opportunities down the road.",[],0

First of all, the corporation of the presiding bishopric isn't actually called that anymore, there was a reorganization a few years back. BUT, it's easier to keep referring to it as that for clarity sake, so I don't blame you.

The corporation of the presiding bishopric includes all of the church employees that get paid, but the organization is *not* for profit. Church employees are people like mechanics, programmers, and travel agents, not preachers. Preachers/leaders are part of the ecclesiastical side, which means they're volunteer and don't get paid.

Then there's the investment side of the church. It's still not for profit, but it pays taxes and isn't legally considered a non-profit. The church teaches financial literacy classes where they tell their members to have an emergency fund, live on less than they make, avoid debt, and invest for the future. This is what they say the investment arm of the church is for, they argue that it would be hypocritical and irresponsible *not* to maximize tithe-payer money and save for emergencies. Saying that they have a 100 billion dollars investment fund makes it seem absurd, but it's ""only"" about 7-10 years of expenses for a huge worldwide church. 

Having that fund has meant that they've been able to give a lot of financial aid (and trust me, they give a lot) even during Covid when tithe-payers didn't pay.

I'm not only relying on my instincts for judgement, but also my many years spent working in auto manufacturing at the plant level. 

LMC literally has all the components to be a successful EV startup. Of course, given the lurking competition and pre revenue cash burn, they must execute in a timely fashion.

CEO Burns, while not a PR maven, is extremely knowledgeable about the tech side of the business, imo.

I can't speak to exactly why all those employees decided to leave LMC (and I doubt you can either), but I can confirm it happens quite frequently in the auto sector. I've seen it happen over and over again at many levels. And you know what, the folks who replaced them managed to work out just fine. So if it's one thing that I've learned, it's that for every person that left and the thought they were irreplaceable, someone else stepped up and filled their shoes.

Investing in any pre revenue pure EV startup is a risk. But imo, you won't find one better positioned for success than $RIDE.",[],0

5167,gyo6hr5,2021-05-19,t1_gynuqvg,wallstreetbets,"And yet he still has a net worth of ~$100 billion.  It‚Äôs almost as if we live in a system where the mega-ultra-spectacularly wealthy can‚Äôt lose.  And I don‚Äôt think anyone should be impressed by multi billionaires pledging to give away a majority of their wealth (not all, that is not the ‚ÄúGiving Pledge‚Äù). So they will still be billionaires, what an absolute sacrifice, /s.

To put that in context he currently is more wealthy than every person you‚Äôve ever talked to in your entire life (pretty sure this is true).  I‚Äôll do some quick math, to back up my claim, if you have some math to prove this majorly wrong, I welcome it, please humble my dumb ass.

So I‚Äôll work it backwards,

Buffett has a net worth of $100,000,000,000

If you‚Äôve talked to 100,000 people in your life they would all have to be millionaires (100,000 ppl x $1,000,000 = $100,000,000,000).

Say you‚Äôre 30, you would have to have talked to ~10 new people every day of your life to get to 100,000 people.  (30yrs x 365 days = 10,950 days; 10,950 days x 10 new ppl = 109,500 ppl talked to in your life). Now if you work in a field that has a ton of new ppl every day you could definitely have more new people you talked to, but then you have to think about in your childhood, you probably didn‚Äôt meet a ton of new ppl while you were going to school each day. 

Also, what are the chance that the theoretical 100,000 ppl you would have to have met would all be millionaires. I did a cursory internet search on how many people are met in a lifetime; there is a lot of what debate on what ‚Äúmeet‚Äù, ‚Äúencounter‚Äù, etc mean; but the estimates were all under the number I threw out I saw 10,000 thrown around and I saw 80,000 in an entire life; not claiming this is super scientific.

Anyways.

TL;DR, Buffet has more money than every person you‚Äôve ever talked to, which (at least for me) is pretty mind blowing and puts his extraordinary wealth in context. The giving pledge is just an elite club of the supercalifragilisticexpialidociously rich, and a way to stunt on the really fucking rich, all while being praised as saints.",[],1

To use a less polarizing example, I remember not long ago the wikimedia foundation came under attack for asking for donations when they had savings that could have ran Wikipedia for a couple of years. Personally, I feel like it would have been irresponsible for wikimedia to wait until they were out of money before they asked for donations. If anything it made me *more* willing to donate to Wikipedia, knowing that my donation was going to be budgeted and managed wisely. And, when you're saving millions of dollars, it's not like you just park it in a savings account.

Other than personal opposition, I don't see why the same shouldn't be true of a church. There's even scriptural president in the parable of the talents. Obviously there's things that church's shouldn't do with their money, I just don't see why investing should be one of them.",[],0

What about requiring your members to pay 10% so that they get to be with their family in the afterlife? They also lie to their members, making them believe that this is going to be used mainly for charity. I know that's certainly what I was told (amongst many other lies). 

They use a mere 0.4% of it for charity, as was also revealed by the whistleblower that revealed the billions hoarded they kept hidden from their members knowledge. If someone told me a charity I contributed money to used 0.4% for actual charity, I'd think of it as a huge scam. That's what this is. 

Then they continue to break the wall of church and state by exerting their influence, like we saw with Prop 8 and Prop 2. They do this with their cash or by telling their members how to vote.

Excerpt from the study:

> The generational new deal is the hardest scenario to envision as it will be progressively defined over the course of
the next decade. Broadly speaking, a generational new deal would contain three elements.
1- Limited bailouts: politicians and voters would realize the futility of trying to restore the world of yesterday.
Whether it is fair or not, the post-Covid 19 world will need fewer cruise ships and cars, as fewer workers commute to their offices. Airlines CEOs, who failed to prepare for what should have been a normal business risk after the SARS, avian flu, and Ebola outbreaks, do not deserve to get bailed out. Neither do investors who bought junk bonds in highly leveraged companies, or the private equity managers who sold them. The U.S. bankruptcy system is designed to reorganize failed businesses and transfer their assets into stronger hands.
Creative destruction is the true engine of long-term growth: it should be encouraged, or at least allowed.
> 2- Large fiscal response: record low interest rates, mass unemployment, and depressed commodity prices create a
generational opportunity to ‚Äúbuild stuff‚Äù ‚Äì in the words of entrepreneur Marc Andreesen. Hospitals, dams, 5-
G towers, windmills, solar panels ‚Ä¶ the bigger the better. Austrian types will correctly point out that some of
this production will be wasted on bridges to nowhere, pork barrel politics, and the kind of highly visible but
uneconomical projects that bureaucrats crave, such as high-speed bullet trains. Encouraging the private sector
to build simple things, such as affordable houses near major urban centers, could reduce the risk of wasteful
spending.
> But ultimately, even wasteful government spending would achieve the goal of injecting money into the
economy, provide employment, and eventually kickstart inflation.
> 3- Inflationary policies: **inflation is the only politically palatable solution to the generational crisis.** A decade of
high single-digit inflation would wipe out about two third of the outstanding value of all student debt ($1.6
trillion), encouraging household formation, boosting discretionary spending, and eventually reversing the
decline in births. A flexible universal basic income would allow the government to target a desired price level much more effectively than the failed monetary policies of the past decade. Protectionist measures would
transfer purchasing power from idle consumers (the old) to the working producers (the young).
> The generational inflation gap I mentioned in the earlier part would eventually shrink. Housing prices would
fall because of the recession at first, and then thanks to an increase in the supply of affordable homes in tense
housing markets. Medicare for all, for which the moral case has never been stronger, would spread the rising
cost of healthcare across generations. Medicare for all would also reduce the cost of labor, increase
competitiveness, and boost economic flexibility as workers would be able to switch jobs more easily. Last, if
the world economy can work on Zoom meetings, so can classes of 30 college students. Colleges have shown
true genius to preserve their rents, escape competition, and ignore the technological revolutions of the past
30 years, but Covid-19 may eventually be lethal to university mandarins. The real value of a fancy college
education (becoming part of a professional network after graduation, four years of boozing without many
responsibilities, and mating with members of the same socio-economic status) cannot be realized on online
classes. Students will not pay $56,631 a year to watch Youtube videos, even if they are dispensed at Ivy League
universities. Travel restrictions may continue to curtail the flow of wealthy foreign students, whose exorbitant
fees keep this inefficient system afloat.",[],0

6316,gyobolf,2021-05-19,t3_nfqs26,wallstreetbets,"Nice work.  A couple points:

There's ""cost push"" inflation (like in the 70's and 80's when oil prices went way high and that pushed costs up; that's also in play now in some sectors) and there's ""demand pull"" inflation (like when everyone wants to build a house so they buy up all the lumber; when it's everywhere, especially wages, it's a sign that the economy is good).

There's also a difference between normal inflation (what's calculated in the CPI (or left out but really should be in there)) and asset inflation.  Asset inflation isn't really seen as a bad thing, and it was literally the strategy for getting out of the 2008 and 2020 crises - pump everything so that nobody's bankrupt anymore.  Asset inflation is the main consequence of QE and all the other money that goes to those that don't need it (which is most of the money).  Stocks up, real estate up, etc.  

I think the Fed is willing to accept increases in the price of hot dogs and haircuts, because if they try to stop that they'll also pop the asset bubble, which has been growing since 2009.   That would fuck a lot of people and also bankrupt pensions, raise government borrowing costs and generally fuck everyone over (except the poor, since they're already fucked).  2008 QE slowed but never stopped, and came back in 2019 via the mysterious repo facilities.

That said you ask rhetorical questions but never dictate what is actually wrong with saving and investing money. Don‚Äôt ask me what I think, I‚Äôm asking what you think since you seem to take serious issue with all of this.

And tithing isn‚Äôt a threat. It‚Äôs an ‚Äúif then‚Äù statement. If you don‚Äôt want to pay tithing that‚Äôs fine, but you can‚Äôt claim what only comes to people who do. To act like you can dictate to deity how he should act is simply narcissistic. 

You claim to have been a member a long time and yet it‚Äôs strange that you seem to have such a foreign grasp on fundamental concepts of their religion. 

Also, for all activities that exist for profit the LDS church does pay all required taxes. This includes investments, properties and production not utilized for tax exempt activities, such as church operation. GME was taxed, as are all other activities invested for profit. Tithes are not taxes and to save excess tithes is not criminal. Nor is there any reason to say it is. Saving money is fundamental to financial principles taught by the mormon faith, is it not? 

So where is the crime here? You keep accusing it of being a MLM or mega Corp but the point of those is to profiteer. Clearly thats not the case here since the church is sitting on a reserve of 100 billion rather than shunting it to whoever would embezzle or profit off of it.

There is a difference between improving a company, and improving it's valuation. Typically improving a company will increase stock price, but the reverse is much less true. There is also a difference between being a shareholder, and a manager. I am a shareholder of several companies. I've never managed a single one, because I've not voted in a single meeting, much less had an impact on the outcome of a decision. Management is work. It's work I think we as a society value vastly more than we should, but it's still work.

I do not begrudge anyone making money for successfully managing a business, though I might disagree as to what his compensation should be. I do absolutely hold animosity for those who manage a business with the intent to increase share price, not grow the business itself.

7220,gyofpwc,2021-05-19,t1_gyoehyn,wallstreetbets,"It all started back in 1901 when Teddy Roosevelt became President of the United States.  He was famously quoted as saying ""walk softly, but carry a big stick"".  From 1901-1937 or so the US wanted to be the one with the biggest stick.  And worked hard to do so.  They pumped their military budget as far as they could, but still didn't have a big enough stick.  


Then WWII came along.  And the US could make their stick as big as they wanted.  In order to defeat the dirty Hun and the slant-eyed devil.  And so they did.  Yet, in doing so, they also became a slave to those that created the stick.  The stick makers could ask for any price they wanted.  And the US would pay that price.  Because they had stick envy (and not insignificantly, their economy became dependent on the stick makers).  


After WWII, one of the generals of that war, that became president said ""we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sough or unsought, by the military-industrial complex"".  And so it was said, so it shall be done.  


FF to today.  LMT can ask any price for any piece of military hardware that they deem fit.  Granted, the US government can push back a little.  ""How about $334M for a raptor?  You really don't need$337?  Right?.""  And the contractor will just say, ""well, we quoted that price given the cost of tungsten at the time of the quote, but its gone up since then.  If you'll look in our contract...""

I had a decent amount of ETC, but damn I was tired of watching the value just dribble away at the rate of several thousands daily, since I had not entered at the most ideal price point, and having averaged down a few times to correct that, I was caught trying to average down and assumed I got caught as the value rose. No worries, I have done well with GME very well and luck have it, it continues, now today who knows it may come to have been a huge mistake, however I hope the 10 other contracts may prove to be just the ticket as I wait to see my ETC show me love once again!

No, the problem is you're sitting over there convinced a bunch of people shouting ""short squeeze"" repeatedly is a common occurrence in the market.

*Actual* short squeeze conditions, such as for GME back in January, are very rare.  Moreover, betting on short squeezes is significantly more risky than many other plays, especially when people keep trying to convince others about ludicrous things like ""infinite price targets.""

did years ago shows me the U.S is lagging. NIO needs to succeed. The   
battery swap infrastructure and technology. Along with NIO global   
branding will succeed, but it doesn't need to in order for NIO to become  
 profitable in less than 2 years.EV and new energy  
 are methods of generating wealth that the EU and China have shifted   
towards years ago. Only now the U.S has finally decided to put a large   
investment into this market. The problem is that China is leading in   
patents for new technology than the U.S by multiple folds. The

don't have to agree with how the money to supplement it is arranged or   
with it at all. But it's here, and it will happen.China  
 already started this decades ago and the blueprints have been shown in

does not. Thus allowing China to capitalize on these untapped markets   
unlike the U.S. China will not make the same   
mistakes other rivaling superpower powers during there time because   
China learned. China has already done what the U.S is planning to do now  
 decades ago. This is why instead of defaulting to gasoline, they opted   
in for EV and new energy infrastructures that scale along with new   
markets. So I am very bullish on China. If this does not succeed, then
