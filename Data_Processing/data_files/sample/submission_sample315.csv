0,2021-04-27,mzmmp9,RobinHood,"Thanks!

So, I am thinking why not use the interest-free $1000 margin cash. I do have the cash but would rather use someone else's to make me money. I really see no downside, have cash in another account. 

Yet, this would advance my investment schedule by a month or so.

Question: Say I use an $800/$1000 interest-free margin. Can I deposit 800 in cash and will that go towards the loan principal?

It almost seems like the only way to pay it back is to Sell said stock. Which sucks, taxes, margin keeps accruing, so eventually, I will be paying the 2.5% interest.

I would like to be to just close this out the loan personally, on my schedule.",[],0
1,2021-04-27,mzmr0k,RobinHood,"I purchased a decent amount of crypto using margin but accidentally selected the wrong checking account to make the purchase. Of course I didn't have enough in the checking account so it caused an account deficit. I immediately chose the correct account and covered the deficit. 

Does anyone know if I will lose the crypto that I purchased last week?",[],0
2,2021-04-27,mzxppx,RobinHood,"On irs website it says 

"" If your loss was disallowed because of the wash sale rules, add the disallowed loss to the cost of the new stock or securities (except in (4) above). The result is your basis in the new stock or securities. This adjustment postpones the loss deduction until the disposition of the new stock or securities. Your holding period for the new stock or securities includes the holding period of the stock or securities sold. ""

Under the $75 call, you can see there a +1,200% increase but thats the part i dont understand. i know it cant mean i,d make +1,200% if i buy the option so what does that mean?

5,2021-04-28,n0fv4o,RobinHood,"So, between here and Discord, at least 4 people have mentioned their Robinhood accounts had been taken over since Saturday. How? [Same as before](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j81vlq/followup_to_my_if_your_robinhood_account_has_been/):

 1. your email account is targeted first; they log in because you have a weak password (I suppose it could also be a [normal breach elsewhere combined with password reuse](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) but everyone willing to tell me said it was just a short or weak password...)
 2. filters to hide emails from Robinhood are added to the email account
 3. a password reset request is sent to Robinhood
 4. the email from Robinhood is intercepted and they click the link to change the password
 5. now that they can log in to Robinhood, they liquidate your account (you'll likely get push notifications as they do this but cannot stop them because you're logged out when the password changed)
 6. your Cash Management card (which they'll even sign up for if you haven't already) is used to make large purchases with vendors that might also be compromised. Last year, they were using the POS systems of a construction company in Virginia and a charity (info which I passed on to the Richmond, VA Field Office) as well as Revolut (a PayPal/Venmo type company that allows you to fund your account with *any* debit card even if it doesn't match your name or billing address) to send money transfers through Eastern Europe. This time, I've seen large purchases online with SNKRDUNK SHIBUYA, a sneakerhead shop in Japan.

If your account is compromised, it will take weeks or months for Robinhood to get back to you and you will be locked out of the account the entire time. To state the obvious, you do not want that! Remember, the 'hacker' (which if you have your dog's name and the number five as your password, it's not much of a hack) has already been in touch with Robinhood and made changes to your account from your email address so they'll have a hard time being absolutely positive you are you.

How to prevent it:
 
 - Change your email password! **This is how they're getting in!**
   - Don't reuse passwords
   - Don't choose passwords because they are 'easy to remember' or 'easy to type' (all signs pointed to this being the biggest problem last year; people were using names and dates, etc. Real 90s era security...)
 - Enable 2FA on your email account (if possible) and on Robinhood
 - Check your email account for any filters that may have been added by someone who isn't you
 - Check your email often! If you placed an order and didn't get an email about it, **check your email filters**!
 - Check for any devices connected to your Robinhood account that are not yours (somewhere in Account Settings). Even if the location matches where you live/work! If you have only used Robinhood on your iPhone and a laptop, there should only be two devices listed!
 - If your email provider has a list of logged in devices, check that too!

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j7dqpc/if_your_robinhood_account_has_been_hacked_please/), Robinhood [mysteriously asked me to not talk about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j81vlq/followup_to_my_if_your_robinhood_account_has_been/) which was strange seeing as a) they weren't being hacked so their own security wasn't at risk, b) everyone willing to talk to me had already be compromised (some had even already been made whole by Robinhood), and c) letting people know what is happening and how can prevent more of their own customers from being hacked. It literally costs them money, time, and reputation *not* telling people what's going on. Fucking dumb, right?

tl;dr: Secure your email account today!",[],0

12,2021-04-28,n0mz1n,RobinHood,"Hi all! 

Robinhood is trying to swindle me out of approximately $170k. While it is a powerful corporation, I feel the people on this thread will have great advice.

*feel free to skip this part— Why I care about fighting this fight? I am a first gen engineering student paying on my own, and my dad has been unemployed since leaving work to care full-time for my sick mom. A careless driver put my dad on disability, so he frequently needs money from us kids to pay for the mortgage/dog/whatever the VA won’t. This money is more important than ever so my family can escape seemingly never-ending f-cked situations, and moreover I’m tired of Robinhood trying to take advantage of people.*

It began in February:

- I had a $10k stake of crypto. One day, I placed a sell. However, the order was pending for hours. The price started rapidly declining while pending to places where I did not want to sell. 

- Robinhood grants users the liberty to cancel orders so long as they are pending. So, I decided it was best to cancel. I soon received the notifications (first the request, then that it officially processed). The sell disappeared. I secured ownership of my securities. 

- At a point later in the night, Robinhood then *executed* the already cancelled sell order. I have been trying for 3 months to get back either my stake or the mounting opportunity cost Robinhood caused in screwing this up, whichever is easier for them. This past week, the value of my stake has skyrocketed to approximately $170k... that is life-changing.  

I reached out to support, giving evidence, timestamps, and reasoning. I included [FINRA 2510b](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/nasdr-rules/2510), stating that brokers/agencies cannot execute trades without written consent from the trader. Getting the official cancellation receipts, I believe I did own my securities and Robinhood later sold them without my consent on an invalid order. 

Their support email keeps regurgitating the same thing that, unfortunately, they will not be offering help, and no they cannot give out the reasons that led to their decision on me when I ask. Fair enough because I think they aren’t required to help until I force them; why not wait until I give up?

Does anyone know if I have a case? If so, any advice or knowledge on what to do (legal, BBB, anything else)? I understand I may be wrong but this money is important to get back. I am thankful for any advice!!! If someone’s advice works and I get my money back, I’d be happy to send them a small share for thanks if that’s legal. 

tl:dr I believe Robinhood violated my rights when it sold my crypto after the order officially cancelled and restored to my account, and do not know how to proceed",[],0

17,2021-04-29,n0ypiz,RobinHood,"I am fine creating stop loss/limit orders on stocks and one-leg options but get confused setting stop loss/limit orders on credit and debit spreads on RH. I've set a close/sell orders on options spreads to execute when the spread falls to a certain amount or reaches a target but a lot of times the spread sells/closes immediately, doing the opposite of what I want it to do. 

For instance, I have a PLTR $23/$20 put credit spread. I received $1.14 in credit for it and it is now trading at 0.77 cents. I want to set a stop loss/limit at $1.14 so that I don't lose money on the trade and just risk the credit I received. However, on RH to close this spread, there is no stop loss option so I need to do a sell limit order. When I've done this in the past and put in a close/sell limit order for $1.14, the option spread sells immediately. I understand that a sell limit order executes at the selected price or better but then my thinking gets jumbled because put credit spreads profit more the lower they go.  How do I set up an order on the put credit spread so the close/sell order executes at $1.14 or higher?

I also have a question about selling a put credit spread at 50% loss. For example, I have a DIS $190/$175 PCS. I received a $5.45 credit and it is currently trading at $7.29 which is a 34% loss. A 50% loss would mean the PCS would be priced at $8.18. How do I set up an close/sell limit order so the spread sells at $8.18?

Thank you",['PLTR'],1

I know that you cannot buy options on margin, but I am in on a LEAPS that cost me roughly $9000 which was my entire account value. I am doing the poor man's covered call/synthetic covered call strategy, and so would like to use margin to invest in stocks that I can just do covered calls with. When I bought the LEAPS and sold the call I got $660 in premium credited to my account, an increase in buying power of $1320, and my margin maintenance was ~$8300. The stock that I am using is SPOT, relatively volatile, and I'm not sure if the margin maintenance will move with my LEAPS position or if I will get a margin call if I invest on margin while in possession of this option. It moves relatively fast, so if an overnight move caused a margin call or automatic liquidation, would it prioritize liquidating stocks invested in on margin? I'm not 100% sure how the margin maintenance works with regards to options and was wondering if you guys had any answers/helpful comments. I did notice after earnings the call dropped in value significantly, about $3000, and the margin maintenance moved with it, leaving room below my account value for the premium collected for the covered call.

I have a good starting point for next steps and have some important questions to answer for myself. THANK YOU!!",['GE'],0

45,2021-05-02,n3i8pu,RobinHood,Hello last week I invited my mom to Robinhood helped her set up her account everything was exactly the same as when I set mine up in February.

46,2021-05-03,n3m2d0,RobinHood,"I'm in my 50s and just found out I have cancer. I started investing for the first time ever in March. Through trial and error, I'm up $1,700 based on an initial investment of $6k. I'll probably have to pay short-term tax because I did some version of day trading...holding onto stocks for a couple of days then selling. This isn't about taxes, though.   


When should I take out profit so that I recoup my initial investment and am only working with profit? I'm in Eth, BTC, QQQ. I'm also in Apple which I'm going to dump in favor of VTI ETh is soaring, but will likely drop. Should I take out the profit from it -  $760 - then start from scratch with it? I'm tempted to liquidate it all and put it in VTI, let it grow safely, then make another lump sum investment. I'm fine, for now.",['AAPL'],0

1. How would I end up owing money or better yet how could I get it to where I owe money?

2. What is APY interest? And could that lead to me owing money.

Question: 

 I had a stock for just under a year and was waiting to sell to avoid capital gains taxes. Then right before the year was up the company was merged with another.  So I was given shares of the company that bought the original company that I owned stock in as the old company no longer exists. Simple merger. 

 Do I have to wait an entire year from when I was given the new company's stock? Or is it already passed the year as I had the old company's stock more than a year ago? 

Hopefully I explained this well enough.

63,2021-05-09,n8el75,RobinHood,"One lucrative industry is going through massive growth caused by the speedy de-regulation and legalization throughout the U.S. This market is… Online Sports Betting (OSB). We will be taking a bird’s eye view into the one and only DraftKings.

**Why DraftKings?**

DraftKings is already a market leader with roughly 20-40% market share (this varies by state). Their main competitors are FanDuel who has yet to IPO. Close 2nd and 3rds are Dave Portnoy's Barstool app and BetMGM.

FanDuel and DraftKings have such a huge lead in front of the market because they've been able to transition their Fantasy Sports apps into OSB. This is all about branding. When you think fantasy sports and the possibility of being able to bet on them it's only natural you think of DraftKings, FanDuel, or now Dave Portnoy who is becoming more relevant with Barstool. DraftKing's branding started years ago with their entry into the fantasy sports market and they are now plastered on all things sports.

Sports-betting is still a small piece of the pie when it comes to anything Casino or gambling, but the covid lockdowns have started transitioning the legalization of Online Sports Betting at a faster pace. This is the result of massive policy changes that help both DraftKings increase their addressable market and eventually governments who will also take a cut via taxes.

The way it is:

Governments taking people’s money directly from taxes = BAD.

Governments legalizing lucrative industries and taxing the crap out of them = GOOD.

The Online Gambling industry is set to go through hyper-growth over the next 10 years. Here’s a forecast done by GrandViewResearch

What makes DraftKings an alluring investment? For the most part DraftKing's revenues are RECURRING. Remember, although this is ""gambling"" many people enjoy OSB as a hobby and losing (or winning) money is all part of having “fun”. The goal of most online gambling apps/companies right now is all about user acquisition and paying whatever it takes to secure their market share. This is a tactic for those with deep pockets and willing to spend as the cost of acquisition per user racks up FAST. The two ways these companies are acquiring customers are through:

1) Huge marketing and advertising expenditures. This includes things such as having their brand name displayed in the background during athlete interviews or on the banners at live sports events.

2) The second and equally expensive route is by offering each user a bonus just for signing up. These are normally along the lines of ""play with us today and we'll match your initial deposit up to $50""

You can see how both these marketing tactics come with high costs, but as long as these companies keep their Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) lower than a user's Life-Time Value (LTV) they will be laughing all the way to the bank. It's like saying they will spend $100 for a customer that will eventually provide $200 in revenues.

**Closing**

In my opinion DraftKings is the Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts of the online gambling industry. You are investing in THE main brand when it comes to sports betting. Although with expensive costs allocated to marketing they are securing market share in an industry that is going through a massive de-regulation and shift in policy changes. Does their current valuation match the TAM and expected growth? That's for you to decide, but at least know that you are investing in one of the top players in the OSB market with one of the strongest brand names out there.",[],0

207,2021-05-19,nfy4ly,RobinHood,"For this example and easy maths I'll say I have $150k in equity and cash in my account.

&#x200B;

I take out margin (2.5% interest) for $150k

&#x200B;

I spend my original $150k on long hold and high dividend stocks - low volatility generally. I also have grown this $150k from around $75k in cash 4 years ago.

&#x200B;

The margin $150k is put into a mixo of:

 1. Solid fundamental stocks I wouldn't mind holding for a long time

2. Meme stocks (GME mainly)

&#x200B;

I buy shares in around 8-10 different companies with fairly high volatility in packs of 100

&#x200B;

I sell covered calls expiring that week at the strike price 50c or $1 above the purchase price.

  
I take the premium and the options either go ITM or OTM

&#x200B;

I've averaged about $2.5k per week so far doing this, I've been using 90% of my margin though and will be toning it down a bit in the future to just aim for $1500-$2k per week in premiums.

397,2021-05-21,nhwea4,RobinHood,"Hello /rRobinHood,

This is my second post on this subreddit. In my first post I needed help getting a call option order for VOD filled. I had trouble because I didn't understand bid-ask spread and I received a lot of feedback.

This post is about two F call options I bought at $23 and $24 on 5/20. I sold them both today at $47 apiece. Can I get a little help understanding profit? At first glance it looks like I've gained $47. 

Is it that simple? I know calculating profits can be a little complicated when it comes to options. Still trying to learn, and I also wanted to post about my success somewhere. Thanks for any input!",[],1
410,2021-05-21,nhxwlf,RobinHood,"Heya, got a quick question that I just can't seem to find the answer to.

&#x200B;

Say the following happened:

5/1 Buy 1 XYZ @ 340$

5/2 Buy 1 XYZ @ 240$

5/18 Sell 1 XYZ @ 40$ (sold two shares, split to two transactions for simplicity)

5/18 Sell 1 XYZ @ 40$

&#x200B;

This would be a pretty substantial loss, however, I'm not sure how to calculate the allowed capital gains/losses for my own books.  Certainly I'd like for the full 500$ in losses to be deductible, however, I don't know how/if that would work out given wash rules.

Would neither be deductible (since for both purchases, there was another purchase within ±30 days of the sale of the same XYZ)?  Or would one be disallowed (and the other one's basis adjusted (does Robinhood even support this?))?

&#x200B;

430,2021-05-22,ni72vc,RobinHood,"Wash sale rule? If I buy let’s say 1 bit coin at 30,000 dollars and it goes down to let’s say 25,00 dollars I then sell if for a loss of 5,000. It continues to go down and I buy it right back let’s say 2 minutes later for 20,000 then it goes back up to 30,000 and I sell it. For a profit of 10,000 dollars. Does the 5k that previously loss a wash? Do I pay tax on the 10,000 I just made or do I pays tax on the 10,000 profit minus my previous loss of 5000. Which would be 5000. And how would this be allowed on the 1099b that Robin Hood has on Cryptos. I know it’s like that for stocks. And I’m asking from those whom have used Robin Hood for crypto that have been in this situation being that they do FIFO rule this can eat into gains of it goes lower in price and I want to trade frequently thanks a lot!",[],0

503,2021-05-23,njbel0,RobinHood,"SPACs might be dead (sorry Chamath), but this one merger has a cult-like following as the buzz around the name continues to grow. This SPAC is IPOE and the merger is with FinTech company SoFi. Brick and mortar banks and queuing in line for services is so 2019, in 2021 this process has become *digitized* and the goal is to have a bank in your *pocket*.

**Banks vs FinTech**

The expansion of financial services and cross-selling of them to existing customers has been a common strategy for traditional banks and finch companies alike. Traditional banks have a massive, already established customer base that they can easily cross sell other financial services to. In fact, the top 15 banks in the world control over 50% of all US bank accounts.

https://preview.redd.it/clrv2hqw9w071.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=91f5e54ef10dcb11fb4f76f38a1db1880c2643ec

SoFi’s moat surrounds 3 different segments:

1. Lending: Personal/student loans and refinancing
2. Tech Platform: Galileo acquisition and payments infrastructure
3. Financial Services: Investing, credit cards, money transfers, etc

**Galileo**

I want to touch up on Galileo because SoFi’s acquisition of the company was highly strategic and has enabled them to integrate at a larger scale. Galileo is a B2B purchasing/payment platform that works with FinTech entities such as Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, and Revolut. With the Galileo platform, these companies can create complex financial payment processes and enable digital banking solutions. Think of Galileo as the infrastructure behind it all and they are growing by over 100% YoY.

https://preview.redd.it/qq3k3p86aw071.png?width=2068&format=png&auto=webp&s=bff53655224fd0e749f47a6cf5c92996e56b04ae

**Trends & Growth**

So why don’t the banks just use their existing customer base to expand into the FinTech industry? Short answer: Because they are BOOMERS. The truth is their legacy infrastructure and IT costs do not help when transitioning into the FinTech space. As per Morgan Stanley, most FinTech startups can actually offer these services at nearly 50% cheaper than the traditional banks.

There are some tailwinds the industry is riding that ranges from more and more customers accessing banking services digitally (this number is even higher among millennials), rise in digital payments by over 20% from 2019 into 2020, and FinTech becoming increasingly popular among personal loans.

SoFi’s customer base has been growing at an average of 66% YoY with their last two quarters hitting 75% growth each. It is no doubt that the platform, the industry, and everything about the business is becoming increasingly popular. Management has noted by year-end 2021 they are expecting to hit over 3 million members (currently at 1.7 million).

https://preview.redd.it/px7pkrq8dw071.png?width=1954&format=png&auto=webp&s=175dfbd00c80be5a18579908b7f041691d840f38

**Conclusion**

What was mentioned above paints a picture that FinTech is disrupting traditional firms across all avenues of financial services (loans, investments, and banking). Traditional banks are failing to keep ahold of the new generation of customers coming into the market. SoFi is able to circumvent the inefficiencies in our current financial systems and provide unparalleled customer service for all their services.",[],0

605,2021-05-25,nkry9g,RobinHood,"Options novice (~1year),

Here's what have...

CUB 75c 10/15 (6x100)

CUB 75c 12/17 (1x100)

I looked into CUB (not well enough) and read the news of their acquisition but I did not know if/when they would be delisted. They were still posting news of business as usual (govt contracts, etc) and these calls were cheap+near ATM so I figured I would go for it. (Feel free to roast me on this poor decision with a near 0% IV)

Am I entitled to shares of this delisted stock if I choose to exercise? Or would it be a wash at $75 since that was the acquisition stock (and likely buyback) price? Did I just burn these premiums on worthless calls for no reason? (Leaning towards yes with a lesson learned)...",[],0
616,2021-04-30,n1jk28,RobinHood,"I just had a quick question regarding margin and the LEAPS position I am in. I know that you cannot buy options on margin, but I am in on a LEAPS that cost me roughly $9000 which was my entire account value. I am doing the poor man's covered call/synthetic covered call strategy, and so would like to use margin to invest in stocks that I can just do covered calls with. When I bought the LEAPS and sold the call I got $660 in premium credited to my account, an increase in buying power of $1320, and my margin maintenance was ~$8300. The stock that I am using is SPOT, relatively volatile, and I'm not sure if the margin maintenance will move with my LEAPS position or if I will get a margin call if I invest on margin while in possession of this option. It moves relatively fast, so if an overnight move caused a margin call or automatic liquidation, would it prioritize liquidating stocks invested in on margin? I'm not 100% sure how the margin maintenance works with regards to options and was wondering if you guys had any answers/helpful comments. I did notice after earnings the call dropped in value significantly, about $3000, and the margin maintenance moved with it, leaving room below my account value for the premium collected for the covered call. I just want to know that if I'm invested with margin that that remains true should the call continue to be volatile.",[],1

619,2021-04-30,n1vaia,RobinHood,"So today I have $2490 in my RH account, and cash available to withdraw was $2490… I turned on margin and it showed margin available was $2490 which was the same as my account balance. So total Buying power should be $2490 x 2. After turning on margin my account now says I only have $490 available to withdraw and my account balance didn’t give me the margin cash either.

621,2021-04-30,n22rqk,RobinHood," I purchased 50 ETC one day @ 7:40 am for an average cost of 37.45. Looking at the graph for the day, ETC was @ 36.30 at the time of purchase. Why did I pay 1.15 more per coin than what the actual price at the time of purchase? That's 57.50 for one transaction. Coinbase charges .45% which would've only cost me approximately $8.17. Why is Robinhood charging so much?

I think Robinhood should let you know what the fees are or what you're average cost is prior to swiping up to complete the trade. It's never accurate, nor is it consistent. Track your transactions and average cost against the cost at the time the transaction took place. I want to see if other people have the same issue.",[],0

EBAY
currently $55.99
sell - 14th May - $56.00 - Put 1x100 -$1.16 - $116.00
buy -14th May - $53.00 - Put 1x100 - $0.26 - $-26.00
Total	$90.00 credit

My profit matrix looks like this (link to Options Profit Calculator):
http://opcalc.com/u6D

$90 is my maximum profit for this option trade which is fine for me.

Can I get some feedback if this is the best spread option to apply? (as opposed to a CALL CREDIT spread, iron condor or any other option programs). Are these the optimal expiration dates and strike values to maximize my profit with as little risk as possible?

635,2021-05-02,n3c5ze,RobinHood,"Hello hello. First, a little bit of background. I'm 32, single with no kids. I contribute towards my 401K and have a substantial amount in my savings. I do not have any credit card debt and my car is paid off. 

I have been trying to learn about investing, stocks, crypto etc for a few months now by reading and watching YouTube videos. The truth is I'm still pretty overwhelmed and confused by it all. It also doesn't help that I hate numbers lol

Anyway, I decided to ""just do it""  about 3 weeks ago and started with $500 on Robinhood. I have 4 free stocks so far and got 3.11 GE, 0.0298 AMZN, 2 BUZZ, 1 NIO, and 266 DOGE. I definitely don't know what I am doing but I want to invest more. $500 more or maybe 1k. I know that I want VTI or VOO also.

I know and understand that most people on here are not financial advisors and I know that it is up to me to do my own research BUT I am coming to you all anyway to ask for your help/advice. People are a wealth of information on this app. 

So if you were me, a beginner, with $1000 to invest today, what would you do? Thank you all in advance and I welcome any questions you may have.

EDIT: Wow!!! Thank you all for your responses and information. I've learned a lot of new terminology that I hadn't come across previously, so I am going to look into those as well.

Question: 

 I had a stock for just under a year and was waiting to sell to avoid capital gains taxes. Then right before the year was up the company was merged with another.

657,2021-05-09,n8el75,RobinHood,"One lucrative industry is going through massive growth caused by the speedy de-regulation and legalization throughout the U.S. This market is… Online Sports Betting (OSB). We will be taking a bird’s eye view into the one and only DraftKings.

**Why DraftKings?**

DraftKings is already a market leader with roughly 20-40% market share (this varies by state). Their main competitors are FanDuel who has yet to IPO. Close 2nd and 3rds are Dave Portnoy's Barstool app and BetMGM.

FanDuel and DraftKings have such a huge lead in front of the market because they've been able to transition their Fantasy Sports apps into OSB. This is all about branding. When you think fantasy sports and the possibility of being able to bet on them it's only natural you think of DraftKings, FanDuel, or now Dave Portnoy who is becoming more relevant with Barstool. DraftKing's branding started years ago with their entry into the fantasy sports market and they are now plastered on all things sports.

Sports-betting is still a small piece of the pie when it comes to anything Casino or gambling, but the covid lockdowns have started transitioning the legalization of Online Sports Betting at a faster pace. This is the result of massive policy changes that help both DraftKings increase their addressable market and eventually governments who will also take a cut via taxes.

The way it is:

Governments taking people’s money directly from taxes = BAD.

Governments legalizing lucrative industries and taxing the crap out of them = GOOD.

The Online Gambling industry is set to go through hyper-growth over the next 10 years. Here’s a forecast done by GrandViewResearch

What makes DraftKings an alluring investment? For the most part DraftKing's revenues are RECURRING. Remember, although this is ""gambling"" many people enjoy OSB as a hobby and losing (or winning) money is all part of having “fun”. The goal of most online gambling apps/companies right now is all about user acquisition and paying whatever it takes to secure their market share. This is a tactic for those with deep pockets and willing to spend as the cost of acquisition per user racks up FAST. The two ways these companies are acquiring customers are through:

1) Huge marketing and advertising expenditures. This includes things such as having their brand name displayed in the background during athlete interviews or on the banners at live sports events.

2) The second and equally expensive route is by offering each user a bonus just for signing up. These are normally along the lines of ""play with us today and we'll match your initial deposit up to $50""

You can see how both these marketing tactics come with high costs, but as long as these companies keep their Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) lower than a user's Life-Time Value (LTV) they will be laughing all the way to the bank. It's like saying they will spend $100 for a customer that will eventually provide $200 in revenues.

**Closing**

In my opinion DraftKings is the Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts of the online gambling industry. You are investing in THE main brand when it comes to sports betting. Although with expensive costs allocated to marketing they are securing market share in an industry that is going through a massive de-regulation and shift in policy changes. Does their current valuation match the TAM and expected growth? That's for you to decide, but at least know that you are investing in one of the top players in the OSB market with one of the strongest brand names out there.",[],0

I take out margin (2.5% interest) for $150k

I spend my original $150k on long hold and high dividend stocks - low volatility generally. I also have grown this $150k from around $75k in cash 4 years ago.

&#x200B;

The margin $150k is put into a mixo of:

 1. Solid fundamental stocks I wouldn't mind holding for a long time

2. Meme stocks (GME mainly)

&#x200B;

I buy shares in around 8-10 different companies with fairly high volatility in packs of 100

&#x200B;

I sell covered calls expiring that week at the strike price 50c or $1 above the purchase price.

  
I take the premium and the options either go ITM or OTM

&#x200B;

I've averaged about $2.5k per week so far doing this, I've been using 90% of my margin though and will be toning it down a bit in the future to just aim for $1500-$2k per week in premiums.

Better yet, just downgrade to the stable version. Leave the beta program in My apps & Games => Beta => Robinhood and hit 'Leave' under ""You're a beta tester.""

706,2021-05-21,nhwea4,RobinHood,"Hello /rRobinHood,

This is my second post on this subreddit. In my first post I needed help getting a call option order for VOD filled. I had trouble because I didn't understand bid-ask spread and I received a lot of feedback.

This post is about two F call options I bought at $23 and $24 on 5/20. I sold them both today at $47 apiece. Can I get a little help understanding profit? At first glance it looks like I've gained $47. 

Is it that simple? I know calculating profits can be a little complicated when it comes to options. Still trying to learn, and I also wanted to post about my success somewhere. Thanks for any input!",[],1
707,2021-05-21,nhxwlf,RobinHood,"Heya, got a quick question that I just can't seem to find the answer to.

&#x200B;

Say the following happened:

5/1 Buy 1 XYZ @ 340$

5/2 Buy 1 XYZ @ 240$

5/18 Sell 1 XYZ @ 40$ (sold two shares, split to two transactions for simplicity)

5/18 Sell 1 XYZ @ 40$

&#x200B;

This would be a pretty substantial loss, however, I'm not sure how to calculate the allowed capital gains/losses for my own books.  Certainly I'd like for the full 500$ in losses to be deductible, however, I don't know how/if that would work out given wash rules.

Would neither be deductible (since for both purchases, there was another purchase within ±30 days of the sale of the same XYZ)?  Or would one be disallowed (and the other one's basis adjusted (does Robinhood even support this?))?

&#x200B;

Sorry if I'm overthinking this – this is my first time actually trying to comprehend the mile-long 1099-B I get from Robinhood and calculate my own books (so whatever TurboTax says I owe won't kill me).",[],0
708,2021-05-22,ni72vc,RobinHood,"Wash sale rule? If I buy let’s say 1 bit coin at 30,000 dollars and it goes down to let’s say 25,00 dollars I then sell if for a loss of 5,000. It continues to go down and I buy it right back let’s say 2 minutes later for 20,000 then it goes back up to 30,000 and I sell it. For a profit of 10,000 dollars. Does the 5k that previously loss a wash? Do I pay tax on the 10,000 I just made or do I pays tax on the 10,000 profit minus my previous loss of 5000. Which would be 5000. And how would this be allowed on the 1099b that Robin Hood has on Cryptos. I know it’s like that for stocks. And I’m asking from those whom have used Robin Hood for crypto that have been in this situation being that they do FIFO rule this can eat into gains of it goes lower in price and I want to trade frequently thanks a lot!",[],0
710,2021-05-23,nj8lc9,RobinHood,Is there a way to do a limit sell of an AMOUNT OF SHARES as opposed to a dollar value?

711,2021-05-23,njbel0,RobinHood,"SPACs might be dead (sorry Chamath), but this one merger has a cult-like following as the buzz around the name continues to grow. This SPAC is IPOE and the merger is with FinTech company SoFi. Brick and mortar banks and queuing in line for services is so 2019, in 2021 this process has become *digitized* and the goal is to have a bank in your *pocket*.

**Banks vs FinTech**

The expansion of financial services and cross-selling of them to existing customers has been a common strategy for traditional banks and finch companies alike. Traditional banks have a massive, already established customer base that they can easily cross sell other financial services to. In fact, the top 15 banks in the world control over 50% of all US bank accounts.

https://preview.redd.it/clrv2hqw9w071.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=91f5e54ef10dcb11fb4f76f38a1db1880c2643ec

SoFi’s moat surrounds 3 different segments:

1. Lending: Personal/student loans and refinancing
2. Tech Platform: Galileo acquisition and payments infrastructure
3. Financial Services: Investing, credit cards, money transfers, etc

**Galileo**

I want to touch up on Galileo because SoFi’s acquisition of the company was highly strategic and has enabled them to integrate at a larger scale. Galileo is a B2B purchasing/payment platform that works with FinTech entities such as Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, and Revolut. With the Galileo platform, these companies can create complex financial payment processes and enable digital banking solutions. Think of Galileo as the infrastructure behind it all and they are growing by over 100% YoY.

https://preview.redd.it/qq3k3p86aw071.png?width=2068&format=png&auto=webp&s=bff53655224fd0e749f47a6cf5c92996e56b04ae

**Trends & Growth**

So why don’t the banks just use their existing customer base to expand into the FinTech industry? Short answer: Because they are BOOMERS. The truth is their legacy infrastructure and IT costs do not help when transitioning into the FinTech space. As per Morgan Stanley, most FinTech startups can actually offer these services at nearly 50% cheaper than the traditional banks.

There are some tailwinds the industry is riding that ranges from more and more customers accessing banking services digitally (this number is even higher among millennials), rise in digital payments by over 20% from 2019 into 2020, and FinTech becoming increasingly popular among personal loans.

SoFi’s customer base has been growing at an average of 66% YoY with their last two quarters hitting 75% growth each. It is no doubt that the platform, the industry, and everything about the business is becoming increasingly popular. Management has noted by year-end 2021 they are expecting to hit over 3 million members (currently at 1.7 million).

**Conclusion**

What was mentioned above paints a picture that FinTech is disrupting traditional firms across all avenues of financial services (loans, investments, and banking). Traditional banks are failing to keep ahold of the new generation of customers coming into the market. SoFi is able to circumvent the inefficiencies in our current financial systems and provide unparalleled customer service for all their services.",[],0

Here's what have...

CUB 75c 10/15 (6x100)

CUB 75c 12/17 (1x100)

I looked into CUB (not well enough) and read the news of their acquisition but I did not know if/when they would be delisted. They were still posting news of business as usual (govt contracts, etc) and these calls were cheap+near ATM so I figured I would go for it. (Feel free to roast me on this poor decision with a near 0% IV)

Am I entitled to shares of this delisted stock if I choose to exercise? Or would it be a wash at $75 since that was the acquisition stock (and likely buyback) price? Did I just burn these premiums on worthless calls for no reason? (Leaning towards yes with a lesson learned)...",[],0

Copy/pasting the timeline from the video description:

-----

I'm trying to buy a little over 2 grand in $22.5 IPOE Calls, expiring Jan 21, 2022. Before I started recording, the option was selling for $2.51.

However, after I put in an order to buy 9 options (at $2.56 each), the price jumped up to $2.60.

Confused, I cancelled the order and started recording.

0:02: After a cancelled order, the option price went back down to $2.52

0:19: I resubmitted my 9 x $2.56, expecting it to clear (at $.04 above ask)

0:22: As soon as the order is placed, the price jumps back up to $2.61, making my $.04 above the ask $.05 below

0:33: I wait 10 seconds and cancel that order

0:34: The second my cancellation goes through, the price goes back down to 2:52

0:43: I resubmit 9 x $2.56

0:45: My order is placed and the option price jumps to $2.61 again

1:10: I want 25 seconds and recancel my order. Again.

1:11: As soon as the cancellation goes through, the price drops back down to $2.52

1:15: Maybe it's a tech thing. I refresh Chrome.

1:28: This time I try 9 x $2.55. One cent less.

1:29: Order placed, price goes up to $2.60. *Also one cent less*.

1:46: Cancel again. Price goes back down to $2.52 again.

1:59: This time I try 8 x $2.65.

2:06: Don't even get to see ""Placed."" It is immediately filled *and the option price doesn't move an inch*

2:12: Try refreshing Chrome again. Still $2.52.

-----

Why did trying to OVERPAY for the option move the price *just* out of reach each time? Moreover, why did entering a MUCH WORSE deal not impact the price whatsoever?

I was assigned 8 x $2.64. Why isn't that the price of the option, then?",[],0

873,2021-04-30,n22rqk,RobinHood," I purchased 50 ETC one day @ 7:40 am for an average cost of 37.45. Looking at the graph for the day, ETC was @ 36.30 at the time of purchase. Why did I pay 1.15 more per coin than what the actual price at the time of purchase? That's 57.50 for one transaction. Coinbase charges .45% which would've only cost me approximately $8.17. Why is Robinhood charging so much?

I think Robinhood should let you know what the fees are or what you're average cost is prior to swiping up to complete the trade. It's never accurate, nor is it consistent.

So I setup a Robinhood account last night and I linked it to my bank and put money into my Robinhood account. I got a free stock and I put some money into dogecoin. So my questions are

1. How would I end up owing money or better yet how could I get it to where I owe money?

2. What is APY interest? And could that lead to me owing money.

906,2021-05-07,n75o8q,RobinHood,"Couldn't find any information on the Internet. Maybe one of you all knows.



Question: 

 I had a stock for just under a year and was waiting to sell to avoid capital gains taxes. Then right before the year was up the company was merged with another.  So I was given shares of the company that bought the original company that I owned stock in as the old company no longer exists. Simple merger. 

 Do I have to wait an entire year from when I was given the new company's stock? Or is it already passed the year as I had the old company's stock more than a year ago? 

Hopefully I explained this well enough.

909,2021-05-09,n8el75,RobinHood,"One lucrative industry is going through massive growth caused by the speedy de-regulation and legalization throughout the U.S. This market is… Online Sports Betting (OSB). We will be taking a bird’s eye view into the one and only DraftKings.

**Why DraftKings?**

DraftKings is already a market leader with roughly 20-40% market share (this varies by state). Their main competitors are FanDuel who has yet to IPO. Close 2nd and 3rds are Dave Portnoy's Barstool app and BetMGM.

FanDuel and DraftKings have such a huge lead in front of the market because they've been able to transition their Fantasy Sports apps into OSB. This is all about branding. When you think fantasy sports and the possibility of being able to bet on them it's only natural you think of DraftKings, FanDuel, or now Dave Portnoy who is becoming more relevant with Barstool. DraftKing's branding started years ago with their entry into the fantasy sports market and they are now plastered on all things sports.

Sports-betting is still a small piece of the pie when it comes to anything Casino or gambling, but the covid lockdowns have started transitioning the legalization of Online Sports Betting at a faster pace. This is the result of massive policy changes that help both DraftKings increase their addressable market and eventually governments who will also take a cut via taxes.

The way it is:

Governments taking people’s money directly from taxes = BAD.

Governments legalizing lucrative industries and taxing the crap out of them = GOOD.

The Online Gambling industry is set to go through hyper-growth over the next 10 years. Here’s a forecast done by GrandViewResearch

What makes DraftKings an alluring investment? For the most part DraftKing's revenues are RECURRING. Remember, although this is ""gambling"" many people enjoy OSB as a hobby and losing (or winning) money is all part of having “fun”. The goal of most online gambling apps/companies right now is all about user acquisition and paying whatever it takes to secure their market share. This is a tactic for those with deep pockets and willing to spend as the cost of acquisition per user racks up FAST. The two ways these companies are acquiring customers are through:

1) Huge marketing and advertising expenditures. This includes things such as having their brand name displayed in the background during athlete interviews or on the banners at live sports events.

2) The second and equally expensive route is by offering each user a bonus just for signing up. These are normally along the lines of ""play with us today and we'll match your initial deposit up to $50""

You can see how both these marketing tactics come with high costs, but as long as these companies keep their Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) lower than a user's Life-Time Value (LTV) they will be laughing all the way to the bank. It's like saying they will spend $100 for a customer that will eventually provide $200 in revenues.

**Closing**

In my opinion DraftKings is the Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts of the online gambling industry. You are investing in THE main brand when it comes to sports betting. Although with expensive costs allocated to marketing they are securing market share in an industry that is going through a massive de-regulation and shift in policy changes. Does their current valuation match the TAM and expected growth? That's for you to decide, but at least know that you are investing in one of the top players in the OSB market with one of the strongest brand names out there.",[],0

936,2021-05-17,nens8w,RobinHood,"Wanted  to try trading options so I saw a stock at 9.75, and bought calls for  10 dollars at .11 per share (so only paid 11 dollars) that expires on  5/21. I didn't realize that this meant that I would end up having to purchase a hundred real shares at 10 dollars, I just thought it meant  I'm betting the stock would be 10 dollars by 5/21.

I  don't have anything close to a 1000 dollars in my account or anywhere,  and I'm not sure that this stock will go up or surpass 10 dollars. How  do I cancel this so I don't end up 1000 dollars in debt?",[],0

945,2021-05-19,nfy4ly,RobinHood,"For this example and easy maths I'll say I have $150k in equity and cash in my account.

&#x200B;

I take out margin (2.5% interest) for $150k

&#x200B;

I spend my original $150k on long hold and high dividend stocks - low volatility generally. I also have grown this $150k from around $75k in cash 4 years ago.

&#x200B;

The margin $150k is put into a mixo of:

 1. Solid fundamental stocks I wouldn't mind holding for a long time

2. Meme stocks (GME mainly)

&#x200B;

I buy shares in around 8-10 different companies with fairly high volatility in packs of 100

&#x200B;

I sell covered calls expiring that week at the strike price 50c or $1 above the purchase price.

  
I take the premium and the options either go ITM or OTM

&#x200B;

I've averaged about $2.5k per week so far doing this, I've been using 90% of my margin though and will be toning it down a bit in the future to just aim for $1500-$2k per week in premiums.

&#x200B;

Tell me why this is stupid. Cheers.",['GME'],0

Yes, if you update, you'll be SOL until they release a fixed beta version. If you do not have this broken beta version yet, disable automatic updates and do not manually update the app (yet).

Better yet, just downgrade to the stable version. Leave the beta program in My apps & Games => Beta => Robinhood and hit 'Leave' under ""You're a beta tester.""

958,2021-05-21,nhwea4,RobinHood,"Hello /rRobinHood,

This is my second post on this subreddit. In my first post I needed help getting a call option order for VOD filled. I had trouble because I didn't understand bid-ask spread and I received a lot of feedback.

This post is about two F call options I bought at $23 and $24 on 5/20. I sold them both today at $47 apiece. Can I get a little help understanding profit? At first glance it looks like I've gained $47. 

Is it that simple? I know calculating profits can be a little complicated when it comes to options. Still trying to learn, and I also wanted to post about my success somewhere. Thanks for any input!",[],1
959,2021-05-21,nhxwlf,RobinHood,"Heya, got a quick question that I just can't seem to find the answer to.

&#x200B;

Say the following happened:

5/1 Buy 1 XYZ @ 340$

5/2 Buy 1 XYZ @ 240$

5/18 Sell 1 XYZ @ 40$ (sold two shares, split to two transactions for simplicity)

5/18 Sell 1 XYZ @ 40$

&#x200B;

This would be a pretty substantial loss, however, I'm not sure how to calculate the allowed capital gains/losses for my own books.  Certainly I'd like for the full 500$ in losses to be deductible, however, I don't know how/if that would work out given wash rules.

Would neither be deductible (since for both purchases, there was another purchase within ±30 days of the sale of the same XYZ)?  Or would one be disallowed (and the other one's basis adjusted (does Robinhood even support this?))?

&#x200B;

960,2021-05-22,ni72vc,RobinHood,"Wash sale rule? If I buy let’s say 1 bit coin at 30,000 dollars and it goes down to let’s say 25,00 dollars I then sell if for a loss of 5,000. It continues to go down and I buy it right back let’s say 2 minutes later for 20,000 then it goes back up to 30,000 and I sell it. For a profit of 10,000 dollars. Does the 5k that previously loss a wash? Do I pay tax on the 10,000 I just made or do I pays tax on the 10,000 profit minus my previous loss of 5000. Which would be 5000. And how would this be allowed on the 1099b that Robin Hood has on Cryptos. I know it’s like that for stocks. And I’m asking from those whom have used Robin Hood for crypto that have been in this situation being that they do FIFO rule this can eat into gains of it goes lower in price and I want to trade frequently thanks a lot!",[],0

963,2021-05-23,njbel0,RobinHood,"SPACs might be dead (sorry Chamath), but this one merger has a cult-like following as the buzz around the name continues to grow. This SPAC is IPOE and the merger is with FinTech company SoFi. Brick and mortar banks and queuing in line for services is so 2019, in 2021 this process has become *digitized* and the goal is to have a bank in your *pocket*.

**Banks vs FinTech**

The expansion of financial services and cross-selling of them to existing customers has been a common strategy for traditional banks and finch companies alike. Traditional banks have a massive, already established customer base that they can easily cross sell other financial services to. In fact, the top 15 banks in the world control over 50% of all US bank accounts.

https://preview.redd.it/clrv2hqw9w071.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=91f5e54ef10dcb11fb4f76f38a1db1880c2643ec

SoFi’s moat surrounds 3 different segments:

1. Lending: Personal/student loans and refinancing
2. Tech Platform: Galileo acquisition and payments infrastructure
3. Financial Services: Investing, credit cards, money transfers, etc

**Galileo**

I want to touch up on Galileo because SoFi’s acquisition of the company was highly strategic and has enabled them to integrate at a larger scale. Galileo is a B2B purchasing/payment platform that works with FinTech entities such as Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, and Revolut. With the Galileo platform, these companies can create complex financial payment processes and enable digital banking solutions. Think of Galileo as the infrastructure behind it all and they are growing by over 100% YoY.

https://preview.redd.it/qq3k3p86aw071.png?width=2068&format=png&auto=webp&s=bff53655224fd0e749f47a6cf5c92996e56b04ae

**Trends & Growth**

So why don’t the banks just use their existing customer base to expand into the FinTech industry? Short answer: Because they are BOOMERS. The truth is their legacy infrastructure and IT costs do not help when transitioning into the FinTech space. As per Morgan Stanley, most FinTech startups can actually offer these services at nearly 50% cheaper than the traditional banks.

There are some tailwinds the industry is riding that ranges from more and more customers accessing banking services digitally (this number is even higher among millennials), rise in digital payments by over 20% from 2019 into 2020, and FinTech becoming increasingly popular among personal loans.

SoFi’s customer base has been growing at an average of 66% YoY with their last two quarters hitting 75% growth each. It is no doubt that the platform, the industry, and everything about the business is becoming increasingly popular. Management has noted by year-end 2021 they are expecting to hit over 3 million members (currently at 1.7 million).

**Conclusion**

What was mentioned above paints a picture that FinTech is disrupting traditional firms across all avenues of financial services (loans, investments, and banking). Traditional banks are failing to keep ahold of the new generation of customers coming into the market. SoFi is able to circumvent the inefficiencies in our current financial systems and provide unparalleled customer service for all their services.",[],0
