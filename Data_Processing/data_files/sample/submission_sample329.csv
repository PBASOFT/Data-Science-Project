8,2021-05-25,stocks,"Hi, I was just wondering what are people doing who work for listed companies. Would be cool to hear experience of other people.

I work for company that is part of large multinational conglomerate that owns many other companies in the same sector. Our parent company is listed on NYSE. However, it is considered low P/E and high dividend value stock that recently got quite expensive so I don't own any stocks of it. Also... knowing how things work from the inside... I actually don't really want to hold any shares of this company... At least not at the current price.

Regarding owning shares its no big deal. We get little training videos about how we are not supposed to trade on insider information and how we are not supposed to trade shares just before and after earnings but other than that, no problem, anyone can own company's shares and I don't think you need to declare anything to HR. Also, we have shares ownership programme where employees are allowed to buy company's share at a discount. I think it's buying shares at cheapest price that quarter or something like that. Didn't really look into it much.

Looking forward to hearing from other people.",nknzhl,[],0

327,2021-05-25,stocks,"Hi everyone! A week or so ago, someone posted in here asking if anyone has done an analysis on Coinbase.

I commented on it but can't seem to find it. I went ahead and did my own analysis and definitely think it's undervalued at its current price. 

You can see my blog post [here](https://onlyalpha.substack.com/p/coinbase-coin-leading-the-way-in?r=gs5o7&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email&utm_source=reddit), and if you like what you see, please consider subscribing (it's free) and get access to new ideas from me as they come.

From my analysis, we're looking at an potential +72% upside!

Summary of what I found:
-  Massive top-line growth and margin expansion will continue to pump out large amounts of cash to drive further customer acquisition and product innovation.

- The growth of crypto adoption globally, both on the retail level and institutional level will continue to fuel its member base within its digital ecosystem.

- New revenue-generating products in the near term and short-term will position Coinbase to become one of the biggest crypto financial services companies in the world.

- Interested investors will have to stomach the ebbs and flows of the crypto market as it slowly establishes its footing given the company‚Äôs direct exposure to the market.",nkqzbo,[],1
369,2021-05-25,stocks,"Quick question, let‚Äôs say I own 50 shares of a stock and I decide to average down while I‚Äôm in the negative and buy 20 shares. That brings my average down and as the stock moves up in price I was wondering if I sell those 20 shares does my average stay the same? Would that count as a wash sale for selling at a loss if I buy back later? Is it just dumb to sell at a loss after averaging down?

385,2021-05-25,stocks,"Yesterday 40.5 million shares were shorted at interest rates 14.1%.

[https://i.gyazo.com/a9dd2ae75e2f9782d07c90dc2dd75b43.png](https://i.gyazo.com/a9dd2ae75e2f9782d07c90dc2dd75b43.png)

So this means shorts who added positions yesterday need to buy all their shares under or equal to $24.63 or they'll actually add a ""net positive value"" to our stock.

&#x200B;

Keep in mind shorts don't work all together, which is how short squeezes happen. Statistically speaking, shorts will likely not be able to hold the price low enough long enough in order for them to buy 40.5 million shares below $24.63.

&#x200B;

""The house always wins, trust the math"" - In this case, we are the house, and statistics are on our side.

Everyday that goes by, the price shorts need to buy their shares back at will drop. I'll update this daily as I collect more data.

388,2021-05-25,stocks,"So here‚Äôs the situation. I have been running credit spreads on spy for a while. I am very good with tracking them and making sure to close out if it is unfavorable. A family emergency came about and I was unable to attend to my stocks for two days. I had 10 spy put credit spreads that went ITM at expiry and I was unable to close them out before expiration due to said emergency. A took a net loss of 1000 bucks (which in the grand scheme of things isn‚Äôt the worst case scenario but still sucks). 

Two days later, I look at my TD Ameritrade account and it exercised the short and long leg to cover. Because it exercised basically 1000 shares of spy, it shows up as $420,000 cost and $419,000 proceeds. This equals out to 1000 dollar loss. I obviously did not put up that much capital.

My question is, when I go to file my taxes next year, is the only thing I need to worry about is my total net gain/losses for the year?

689,2021-05-25,stocks,"So I'm quite new at this, started investing like a week before the whole GME thing (unfortunately didn't buy any though). Advice I've gotten has said to buy into the market piece by piece, slowly over time and I've been following it. When it comes to selling I've assumed I'd just sell everything I had in a stock once it went up enough but then I thought ""well what if I sell it off piece by piece"". Specifically I have a +$150 return on 22nd Century Group Inc so I sold $130 worth of it. I figure if it continues to climb sure I'll make a bit less money but if it crashes (which I don't think is likely but you never know) I'll lose less and if it dips but looks like it'll come back up I can use the money from the sale to buy more. I know that sounds like I'm trying to time the market which is foolish but this is motivated more by wanting to actually secure the money I make from my investments rather then watch the money number go up only for it to drop like a rock before I actually get any of it out.

765,2021-05-25,stocks,"...it happens.

 It's a common mistake even experienced investors mistake. I've made it. I guarantee half the people on here who ridicule others for it, have done it. Millionaires have gone bankrupt through bad investments. It isn't just retail traders and lower/middle class who suffer from it. 

Like a lot of people, I used to say I never invest more than I can afford. I believed it because I wasn't looking at the whole of my financial situation and was ignoring major red flags. It's easy to tell yourself you aren't making such a ""rookie"" mistake while ignoring red flags.  If this might be you, consider simple signs you need to pullback:

- you are constantly watching price fluctuations and agonizing over dips. This happens because you can't afford to lose what you've put in which means you've put too much in. If you're losing too much time during your day watching stock prices and your job isn't a day trader than you need to lower your investment.

- panic selling at even a small loss. Nothing wrong with putting a stop loss in place but if you're putting one in for a small percent drop, chances are you're terrified of losing more than you can afford. Cut down your stake and you'll find you're able to weather the dips long term

- thinking about your investment as ""money you have"" to boost your confidence in your bank account. If you have $2k in your checking account but tell yourself it's OK because you have $10k in stocks, you are way in over your head. 

Here are some tips I've learned along the way that might help some others:

1. Don't beat yourself up too much or lose too much sleep when you realize you're in a hole. Its fixable and with mitigation, you'll be able to climb back out.

2. DON'T double down and try to recoup losses by putting more money you can't afford in. 

3. If you've put in too much and lost a lot, hold past the dip and sell once the stock has recovered to a safe degree. It's extremely rare for a stock to do a permanent  downward slump. Panic selling at the bottom screws you more. If a 50% drop happens and you've lost faith in the stock, wait until it comes up 25% to sell. This obviously is difficult to predict and modular depending on the stock and loss but unless a company is rumored to be going under entirely, you can wait for the buoy.

4. Just because you aren't losing money doesn't mean you aren't over-investing. Even if you're seeing gains but you're living paycheck to paycheck, you are over-invested. Stocks aren't a substitute for a savings account or as a holding place for all your extra funds. Its easy to placate out of that thinking when the going is good but that's how people get royally screwed. Even if it hurts, sell what you need to in order to get right financially. You might see fewer gains but you'll sleep better st night 

5. Make a gated checkpoint system of what you invest. For example, 20% of your paycheck goes into savings. 30% of your monthly savings account goes into investments. Find a number thats safe for you.

6. Last but not least, always imagine your investment is a vacation. A lot of people say ""assume it's money down the drain,"" but I disagree with this from a psychological standpoint. If you're active in trading, it's hard to simply view the money as gone. Imagine you're planning a vacation and the money you're putting in is what you're spending. You obviously want a nice vacation but no one spends their life savings on a vacation (unless you're dying in which case go nuts). Some vacations end up being worth the money and some end up a disappointment, but you don't ruin your financial life by taking a vacation and buying stocks should be no different.
