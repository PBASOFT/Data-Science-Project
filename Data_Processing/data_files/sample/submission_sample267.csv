88,2021-05-21,investing,"Investment Thesis for Daily Journal (DJCO)

Introduction:  The Daily Journal is viewed by the general public as a dying newspaper business.  It is a dying newspaper business, but the Daily Journal has pivoted itself to a SaaS business, but is trading at a valuation far below most other publicly traded Saas businesses.  We will investigate why the Daily Journal is a worthwhile investment at its current valuation.

Management:  Normally, we’d begin by looking at the business, but management within the Daily Journal is incredibly strong, so this will be our beginning.  The Chairman of the Board in Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.  He bought the Daily Journal in 1977 for $2 million dollars and has been the Chairman ever since.  The lesser known name leading the Daily Journal is Gerald Salzman.  He joined the Daily Journal in 1986 as their President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer.  As such, there is likely no one else who knows the Daily Journal as well as Gerald Salzman.  As an added bonus to the quality of the two men leading the Daily Journal, their executive compensation is almost unheard of.  The Board of Directors receive a payment of either $5000 or $0.  Gerald Salzman, the CEO, receives a salary of $250,000.  These are acceptable salaries due to the large amount of insider ownership within the Daily Journal.

The Business:  The Daily Journal has three business segments, 1) The Daily Journal Newspaper, 2) Equity Investments, and 3) Journal Technologies.

---

The Daily Journal Newspaper is a series of mostly California based legal newspapers.  Their revenue comes from advertising from display advertising (i.e. traditional advertising found in most newspapers), classified advertising, trustee notice sale advertising, legal notice advertising, and circulation advertising.  The sad but unfortunate truth for investors is that this portion of their business is worth very little.  The good news, however, is that most investors outside of the Daily Journal are not interested in investing in a dying newspaper and thus has led to the undervaluation of the Daily Journal.

I won’t spend any more time on this segment except to say that the newspaper’s most successful year isemi-modern history was during 2008 due to an extreme uptick in the need for legal advertising relating to the foreclosure of many homes.  It is possible that if another recession strikes, the newspaper business of the Daily Journal could provide some financial cushion to keep the Daily Journal in strong health.

---

Equities have been a growing proportion of the Daily Journal’s intrinsic value.  Charlie Munger’s investing prowess that has benefited Berkshire is also at work within the Daily Journal.  We have insight into the Daily Journal’s American investments thanks to their most recent 13F filing, which was released within the last week.  At this time, the Daily Journal holds $197 million worth of American equities, mostly concentrated in financial services similarly to the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.  Another notable holding is a new and growing position in Alibaba.  

While it is not explicitly confirmed, there is a VERY strong evidence that the Daily Journal also holds a sizable position in BYD, a Hong Kong traded electric car manufacturer.  This would not appear in its 13F filings, so its size cannot be confirmed, however we can make an educated guess.  The exact value of his BYD investment is unknown, however it is assumed to be be roughly $140 million.  In the most recent filing, the Daily Journal notes that it sold $20 million of one of its positions to reinvest into another security.  The suspicion is that this was a shift from BYD to BABA.  As such, we will value the BYD position at $120, though in truth, it may be slightly higher as BYD traded at a fewer dollars higher of a valuation prior to the most recent filing.  Nonetheless, we will assume its value is $120 million.  This brings the Daily Journal’s equity portfolio to a value of $317 million.

The Daily Journal also has $27 million in cash according to their latest annual report and they hold some office buildings in Los Angeles and in Utah which THEY value at $16.5 million.  I emphasized that they value the building because, as I’ll discuss below, the company has some questionable accounting practices.  In the instance of the office buildings in Los Angeles as an example, they valued the buildings at $16.5 million roughly 20 years ago and that figure has never been adjusted.  The result is that they are likely undervaluing the true value of their real estate holdings.  If we increase the value of these holding to $30 million, which seems like a fair appraisal for their buildings based on current market rate, this results in a total equity and asset value of $374 million.

Their liabilities consist of ~$60 million in deferred capital gains (0% interest), a $29.5 million margin loan (3% interest), and a $1.5 million mortgage (4% interest).  The deferred capital gains will not be paid anytime soon as Charlie Munger likes to hold stocks and when he sells, typically he will move into another qualified investment.  The margin loan was used to acquire businesses to build the Saas business and is serviced by the dividends from the bank stocks in the equity portfolio.  The mortgage is self explanatory.  Total liabilities amount to $91 million

Before jumping into the last portion of the Daily Journal’s business segment, I want to note that the Daily Journal has a market cap of $414 million.  As such, to reach its market cap valuation, assuming no value is assigned to the legal newspaper business (it has a value, it’s just not a high value and in all honesty, I don’t know what a fair value is for that business), the Journal Technologies business only needs to be worth $131 million to come a fair market value at its current market cap valuation.

Journal Technologies is the hidden gem of the Daily Journal.  It is a legal Saas business being sold to municipalities via the RFP process.  It is a case management system built off of a central e-Suites product that is then configured to meet the client’s needs.

It has a unique business model that results in, once again, an undervaluation of the company.  After being awarded an RFP, the company will then define the scope of the product, establish servers on site, and install its product, and then configure it to the clients needs.  All of this work takes 4 to 8 years to complete and during this time, the municipality is not billed.  On a relevant note to the questionable accounting practices above, the Daily Journal does not report the forthcoming revenue on its financial statements, thus these contracts have not necessarily been taken into account to determine the Daily Journal’s current market valuation.

When its e-Suites product goes live, the Daily Journal will charge an implementation fee and subsequently bill a licensing fee for the next 10 years (with built in price adjustments to account for inflation).  Currently, Daily Journal has over $100 million in forthcoming revenue which, due to their billing practices, is a very high-margin revenue once billing starts.  These contracts are found in the USA, Australia, Canada, and Tasmania currently, though more may have been signed and not discovered.  Credit to Matthew Peterson for taking the time to search across the web looking for tenders awarded to the Daily Journal, as there is not a central repository to identify these contracts.

Moving forward, the assumption is that the Daily Journal will continue onboarding new jurisdictions, there will be an increase in licenses purchased for existing contracts after e-Suites launches, consulting fees for upgrades and modifications will increase, and other e-solutions will be integrated with e-Suites to increase revenue (such as e-payment for fines and tickets).

While the Journal Technologies already has $30-some million in revenue, this figure will increase with time.  Additionally, these municipalities will likely continue using the e-Suite services once they go live after the time and cost of configuration, meaning revenue that is on the books today is revenue that will be on the books likely after the 10 years of licensing has expired.  Presently, Journal Technologies is a $200-$300 million business based on the figures and assumptions above.  Under this assumption, the Daily Journal is valued somewhere between $483 million and $583 million, meaning it is currently undervalued by 17% to 41%.

---

There are a few risks that need to be mentioned.  One is liquidity.  The Daily Journal has a $400 million dollar market cap and is too small for many large financial institutions to monitor.  It also has a $300 share price which, while irrelevant to value, will scare away many newer retail investors who invest $20 to $50 at a time.  Beyond these two issues, the Daily Journal has quite a bit of insider ownership or is owned by firms with long-term visions, thus they are not willing to sell shares on a daily basis.  The result is that only about 5,000 shares are traded on a daily basis.  This means that if you need to liquidate your position in a pinch, you may have to sell below the market rate.

The other glaring issue is age.  Charlie Munger is 97 years old and Gerald Salzman is 80 years old.  Beyond not being at the forefront of technological innovation on a personal level (some may view this as an issue when running a Saas business, personally I am not concerned as there job is to manage the people driving the Saas business), their old age means that in the coming years, their leadership may cease to exist.  No clear succession plan has been identified (this was raised during their last annual meeting by a concerned shareholder).  As management is a key strength within this business, this could be reason for pause for prospective shareholders.

Lastly, there is the $16 billion elephant in the room.  Tyler Technologies is their key competitor.  There are other smaller competitors who offer more limited solutions, but Tyler Technologies is the real competition in this space.  While their products are more modern and (likely) have better and flashier features, this is not necessarily what wins in RFP processes.  Instead, the Daily Journal’s practice of not charging the client until launch is a much more appealing catch for prospective clients.  While I’m sure Tyler Technologies will be a fine company in the long-term, its hard to argue that their fundamentals are nearly as attractive as the fundamentals of the Daily Journal.  The Daily Journal is valued at 8x sales, has a P/B of under 2, and has a P/E of 3.5.  By comparison, Tyler Technologies has a P/B of 8, is valued at 14x sales, and has a P/E of 91.  Tyler Technologies would need to continue growing at a very rapid pace to be a strong value investment (note that Tyler Technologies is still rapidly growing, though this rapid growth is slowing).  By comparison, the Daily Journal, if it continues at its current growth, is already a great investment.  As most clients are onboarded, growth is increasing and it is my belief that this will be a phenomenal investment.

89,2021-05-21,investing,"PPE is becoming much more of a B2B industry, with businesses in need of face masks and other gear to keep operations running smoothly while restrictions are lifted for the general public. This is especially true in states like NY where restrictions are tighter than Miami. 

As the CDC loosens fask mask restrictions for vaccinated people, I’m seeing a ton of young people outside (maskless) in strict areas like NYC. The streets look like a Miami Spring Break - a whole gathering of young people in the streets in large numbers and no masks to be found. 

The big takeaway, however, is that masks are strictly enforced inside all establishments. Using restaurants as an example, customers must wear masks when they enter/exit and move around, but they are not required to wear masks when they eat. Most importantly, business employees MUST wear masks at all times, and will therefore go through masks at a much quicker pace. The business itself will have to provide PPE for their employees, leading me to conclude the future of COVID era PPE is B2B (in the US / EU and countries with access to vaccinations). 

What company is best situated to provide business with direct PPE supply? OPTEC International (OPTI) acquired WeShield - a B2B PPE supplier, with clients from Old Navy to Carl’s Jr. What led me to OPTEC and WeShield however, is an [article ](https://www.bkreader.com/2021/04/14/nyc-restaurants-gifted-free-ppe-through-new-partnership/)I found about their PPE donations to NYC restaurants through a partnership with the NYC Hospitality Alliance. It turns out the WeShield is run by fellow restaurant owners turned medical suppliers. In the article, a WeShield spokesperson said that the PPE cost of a restaurant is about $5-10 per employee, per day. 

The article also acknowledged that alleviating PPE costs for independent restaurants is what sparked their donation campaign. But without donations, $5-10 per employee per day really adds up and leaves us with a still emerging market of PPE buyers. Not just restaurants but all brick and mortar businesses are new customers in a space that was mostly used by healthcare organizations.

It will be interesting to see how the divide for public vs commercial PPE restrictions grows and which sectors maintain their status as large quantity PPE purchasers. For now, restaurants and retail locations have no plans on changing their PPE policies which leaves a niche market for suppliers like OPTEC.",nhv1rp,[],0

97,2021-05-21,investing,"Hi all,

I am looking forward to opening a position on Amazon but I still have a tiny small doubt in my mind, I am wondering if posting my doubt here can help me clear it or better understand it.

The doubt I have is that wouldn't reopening cause a decrease of deliveries on [amazon.com](https://amazon.com)? [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) seems to be hot last year because people don't want to go to stores to buy stuff but once the store opens, wouldn't the traffic of [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) go down? Also, since people are at home more, AWS was getting a lot more traffic from their popular clients such as Netflix. But once the economy reopens, people won't stay at home as much and therefore not go on to AWS-hosted websites as much, right? Other services such as Twitch and Amazon Prime should have lower traffic too because of people spending less time at homes. The only few services I think of might benefit are Whole Foods and IMDb.com.

But somehow, analysts seem very bullish on Amazon's short-term. I am seeing a bunch of $4000-$5000 price targets. Why are analysts giving such high price targets when so much of Amazon's revenue depends on the environment of staying at home?

There is a huge demand for the tech especially for the rise of big batteries in EVs.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-19/oatly-is-said-to-price-ipo-at-top-of-range-with-markets-slumping

Oatly Group AB, the vegan food and drink maker, jumped in its debut after pricing its initial public offering at the top of a marketed range.

Shares opened Thursday at $22.12 in New York, a 30% jump from their $17 IPO price. The company and its investors sold more than 84 million American depositary shares on Wednesday, raising more than $1.4 billion. The Swedish company had offered the shares for $15 to $17 each.

Oatly’s shares, which rose as much as 34%, were up 29% to $21.95 at 1:39 p.m., giving the company a market value of about $13 billion, based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

In July, it secured $200 million in new capital from investors led by Blackstone Group Inc. The group also included celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z, as well as Starbucks Corp. founder Howard Schultz. The company was valued at about $2 billion in that round.


Both Jay-Z, through his company Roc Nation, and Schultz also participated in the IPO, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. A representative for Oatly declined to comment. Roc Nation and Schultz didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The IPO underscores plant-based products’ jump into the mainstream, as environmental and health concerns spur consumers to seek alternatives to traditional meat and dairy products. Investors have been looking for ways to replicate the public-market success of Beyond Meat Inc., whose shares have surged more than 300% since it went public in May 2019.

Oatly’s biggest obstacle might be its own popularity. Since its entrance into the U.S. market in 2017, finding Oatly in coffee shops and supermarkets has become something of a treasure hunt for shoppers.

The company opened a $15 million Millville, New Jersey, plant in 2019 to help meet the growing demand, but even now, shortages are frequent, as Covid-related delays have kept a planned second U.S. production from coming online.

In March, supermarkets across the U.S. -- and even its big new customer Starbucks -- reported trouble procuring orders.

While the current shortage won’t end overnight, Chief Executive Officer Toni Petersson sounded an optimistic note.

Fulfilling Orders
“This year, we will bring on board new capacity every single quarter,” he said in an interview ahead of the first trade. The company is expanding its Netherlands plant, putting out commercial products from its Utah plant, and is doing test runs in Singapore, where the factory will be “up and running” in the second quarter, he said.

For now, Oatly is only filling 70% of orders in its key markets, so it is “not really” taking on new customers, Petersson said, adding that the gap is between supply and orders, not supply and demand. “First we will close the gaps, then expand with new retail partners,” he added.

Oatly was started in 1994 by brothers Rickard and Bjorn Oste. Using technology based on research from Sweden’s Lund University, the company turns fiber-rich oats into liquid food.

Oatly’s offering was led by Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Credit Suisse Group AG. The shares are trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol OTLY.",nhap36,[],1

699,2021-05-28,investing,"Can anyone recommend a portfolio application that can track both stocks and crypto transactions?

I am currently using [https://www.portfolio-performance.info/en/](https://www.portfolio-performance.info/en/) which is great, but it is missing a few features.

I need something that can do the following:

* Track multiple accounts denominated in different currencies
* Input buy/sell transactions that allows deduction of fees in different fiat currencies
* Input buy/sell transactions that deducts fees in another coin (crypto)
* Input dividend transactions that adds dividends in coins (crypto)
* Input swaps (trading one coin for another coin) + deduction of fees in another coin (crypto)
* Analytics for overall portfolio performance (returns, fees, ROI over time, etc.)
* Benchmark portfolio performance against securities, indexes, or other portfolios

Nice to haves:

* Multi platform support (desktop, mobile, etc.)
* Defi support (for yield farming)

Currently, this is all still being tracked using the same application. However, every crypto transaction has to be split into multiple transactions to be tracked. Hope to find another application that can help ease managing my portfolio without sacrificing analytics. Thanks in advance.",nmu5n7,[],0

742,2021-05-28,investing,"(I know this is not CMV but figured the format worked and really more interested in this sub’s take on it)

I understand that taxation on investments is advantageous to incentivize investing. However, a big part of that requires people to adjust their investment strategy over time. But in effect, a lot of investments are more rigid because people avoid realizing gains when they would like to pivot their positions. Meanwhile, realizing losses is one of the oldest tricks in the books to diminish one’s tax liability. 

So here’s my view: kind of like a 401k account, there should be a system that allows people to sell without tax implications as long as those proceeds are used to reinvest in another stock, and as long as those stocks have been held for over a year (does not apply to day trading, so that it stays in the spirit of investing). Taxation would kick in only when a sale is used to convert into actual income. In exchange, the tax rate on this income would be taxed higher (say as a regular income, for the sake of argument). One question is what base to use? In this case, I’d say we could simply use the overall performance of the portfolio to estimate those gains. Ultimately this is the performance everyone is looking at.

Basically, think of it as a 401k type account without penalty for early withdrawal, where only money coming out of that account is taxed.

I feel like it could solve a few problems:

1/ It would enable people to consider investing in whatever is more worthy to them. People change their minds, companies change their strategies… it would bring more fluidity to the system and promote the idea of genuinely investing in companies worth investing in.
2/ it would counterbalance loss realization tactics.
3/ it would incentivize more people to invest and, like a 401k, make them think longer term about when to use that money. 
4/ it would bring an end (or at least reduce the gap) to the issue of work being taxed more than wealth, which imo remains one of the most unfair drivers of inequality(I know I may lose a few folks on that point, so maybe we don’t need to enter that debate too heavily today)",nmvuhl,[],1

782,2021-05-28,investing,"President Joe Biden’s proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year assumes that a hike in the capital-gains tax rate took effect in late April, meaning that it already would be too late for high-income investors to realize gains at lower tax rates, according to a Wall Street Journal report out Thursday citing people familiar with the proposal.

Biden plans to increase the top tax rate on capital gains to 43.4% from 23.8% for households with income over $1 million, though Congress must OK any hikes and retroactive effective dates, the report added.

Separately, a New York Times report said Biden plans to propose a $6 trillion budget on Friday that would take the U.S. to its highest sustained levels of federal spending since World War II.

Documents obtained by the Times show that Biden’s first budget request as president calls for total spending to rise to $8.2 trillion by 2031 as he aims to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure and substantially expand the social safety net, that newspaper’s report added.

847,2021-05-21,investing,"Hi all,

I am looking forward to opening a position on Amazon but I still have a tiny small doubt in my mind, I am wondering if posting my doubt here can help me clear it or better understand it.

The doubt I have is that wouldn't reopening cause a decrease of deliveries on [amazon.com](https://amazon.com)? [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) seems to be hot last year because people don't want to go to stores to buy stuff but once the store opens, wouldn't the traffic of [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) go down? Also, since people are at home more, AWS was getting a lot more traffic from their popular clients such as Netflix. But once the economy reopens, people won't stay at home as much and therefore not go on to AWS-hosted websites as much, right? Other services such as Twitch and Amazon Prime should have lower traffic too because of people spending less time at homes. The only few services I think of might benefit are Whole Foods and IMDb.com.

But somehow, analysts seem very bullish on Amazon's short-term. I am seeing a bunch of $4000-$5000 price targets. Why are analysts giving such high price targets when so much of Amazon's revenue depends on the environment of staying at home?

850,2021-05-21,investing,"Investment Thesis for Daily Journal (DJCO)

Introduction:  The Daily Journal is viewed by the general public as a dying newspaper business.  It is a dying newspaper business, but the Daily Journal has pivoted itself to a SaaS business, but is trading at a valuation far below most other publicly traded Saas businesses.  We will investigate why the Daily Journal is a worthwhile investment at its current valuation.

Management:  Normally, we’d begin by looking at the business, but management within the Daily Journal is incredibly strong, so this will be our beginning.  The Chairman of the Board in Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.  He bought the Daily Journal in 1977 for $2 million dollars and has been the Chairman ever since.  The lesser known name leading the Daily Journal is Gerald Salzman.  He joined the Daily Journal in 1986 as their President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer.  As such, there is likely no one else who knows the Daily Journal as well as Gerald Salzman.  As an added bonus to the quality of the two men leading the Daily Journal, their executive compensation is almost unheard of.  The Board of Directors receive a payment of either $5000 or $0.  Gerald Salzman, the CEO, receives a salary of $250,000.  These are acceptable salaries due to the large amount of insider ownership within the Daily Journal.

The Business:  The Daily Journal has three business segments, 1) The Daily Journal Newspaper, 2) Equity Investments, and 3) Journal Technologies.

---

The Daily Journal Newspaper is a series of mostly California based legal newspapers.  Their revenue comes from advertising from display advertising (i.e. traditional advertising found in most newspapers), classified advertising, trustee notice sale advertising, legal notice advertising, and circulation advertising.  The sad but unfortunate truth for investors is that this portion of their business is worth very little.  The good news, however, is that most investors outside of the Daily Journal are not interested in investing in a dying newspaper and thus has led to the undervaluation of the Daily Journal.

I won’t spend any more time on this segment except to say that the newspaper’s most successful year isemi-modern history was during 2008 due to an extreme uptick in the need for legal advertising relating to the foreclosure of many homes.  It is possible that if another recession strikes, the newspaper business of the Daily Journal could provide some financial cushion to keep the Daily Journal in strong health.

---

Equities have been a growing proportion of the Daily Journal’s intrinsic value.  Charlie Munger’s investing prowess that has benefited Berkshire is also at work within the Daily Journal.  We have insight into the Daily Journal’s American investments thanks to their most recent 13F filing, which was released within the last week.  At this time, the Daily Journal holds $197 million worth of American equities, mostly concentrated in financial services similarly to the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.  Another notable holding is a new and growing position in Alibaba.  

While it is not explicitly confirmed, there is a VERY strong evidence that the Daily Journal also holds a sizable position in BYD, a Hong Kong traded electric car manufacturer.  This would not appear in its 13F filings, so its size cannot be confirmed, however we can make an educated guess.  The exact value of his BYD investment is unknown, however it is assumed to be be roughly $140 million.  In the most recent filing, the Daily Journal notes that it sold $20 million of one of its positions to reinvest into another security.  The suspicion is that this was a shift from BYD to BABA.  As such, we will value the BYD position at $120, though in truth, it may be slightly higher as BYD traded at a fewer dollars higher of a valuation prior to the most recent filing.  Nonetheless, we will assume its value is $120 million.  This brings the Daily Journal’s equity portfolio to a value of $317 million.

The Daily Journal also has $27 million in cash according to their latest annual report and they hold some office buildings in Los Angeles and in Utah which THEY value at $16.5 million.  I emphasized that they value the building because, as I’ll discuss below, the company has some questionable accounting practices.  In the instance of the office buildings in Los Angeles as an example, they valued the buildings at $16.5 million roughly 20 years ago and that figure has never been adjusted.  The result is that they are likely undervaluing the true value of their real estate holdings.  If we increase the value of these holding to $30 million, which seems like a fair appraisal for their buildings based on current market rate, this results in a total equity and asset value of $374 million.

Their liabilities consist of ~$60 million in deferred capital gains (0% interest), a $29.5 million margin loan (3% interest), and a $1.5 million mortgage (4% interest).  The deferred capital gains will not be paid anytime soon as Charlie Munger likes to hold stocks and when he sells, typically he will move into another qualified investment.  The margin loan was used to acquire businesses to build the Saas business and is serviced by the dividends from the bank stocks in the equity portfolio.  The mortgage is self explanatory.  Total liabilities amount to $91 million

Before jumping into the last portion of the Daily Journal’s business segment, I want to note that the Daily Journal has a market cap of $414 million.  As such, to reach its market cap valuation, assuming no value is assigned to the legal newspaper business (it has a value, it’s just not a high value and in all honesty, I don’t know what a fair value is for that business), the Journal Technologies business only needs to be worth $131 million to come a fair market value at its current market cap valuation.

---

Journal Technologies is the hidden gem of the Daily Journal.  It is a legal Saas business being sold to municipalities via the RFP process.  It is a case management system built off of a central e-Suites product that is then configured to meet the client’s needs.

It has a unique business model that results in, once again, an undervaluation of the company.  After being awarded an RFP, the company will then define the scope of the product, establish servers on site, and install its product, and then configure it to the clients needs.  All of this work takes 4 to 8 years to complete and during this time, the municipality is not billed.  On a relevant note to the questionable accounting practices above, the Daily Journal does not report the forthcoming revenue on its financial statements, thus these contracts have not necessarily been taken into account to determine the Daily Journal’s current market valuation.

When its e-Suites product goes live, the Daily Journal will charge an implementation fee and subsequently bill a licensing fee for the next 10 years (with built in price adjustments to account for inflation).  Currently, Daily Journal has over $100 million in forthcoming revenue which, due to their billing practices, is a very high-margin revenue once billing starts.  These contracts are found in the USA, Australia, Canada, and Tasmania currently, though more may have been signed and not discovered.  Credit to Matthew Peterson for taking the time to search across the web looking for tenders awarded to the Daily Journal, as there is not a central repository to identify these contracts.

Moving forward, the assumption is that the Daily Journal will continue onboarding new jurisdictions, there will be an increase in licenses purchased for existing contracts after e-Suites launches, consulting fees for upgrades and modifications will increase, and other e-solutions will be integrated with e-Suites to increase revenue (such as e-payment for fines and tickets).

While the Journal Technologies already has $30-some million in revenue, this figure will increase with time.  Additionally, these municipalities will likely continue using the e-Suite services once they go live after the time and cost of configuration, meaning revenue that is on the books today is revenue that will be on the books likely after the 10 years of licensing has expired.  Presently, Journal Technologies is a $200-$300 million business based on the figures and assumptions above.  Under this assumption, the Daily Journal is valued somewhere between $483 million and $583 million, meaning it is currently undervalued by 17% to 41%.

---

There are a few risks that need to be mentioned.  One is liquidity.  The Daily Journal has a $400 million dollar market cap and is too small for many large financial institutions to monitor.  It also has a $300 share price which, while irrelevant to value, will scare away many newer retail investors who invest $20 to $50 at a time.  Beyond these two issues, the Daily Journal has quite a bit of insider ownership or is owned by firms with long-term visions, thus they are not willing to sell shares on a daily basis.  The result is that only about 5,000 shares are traded on a daily basis.  This means that if you need to liquidate your position in a pinch, you may have to sell below the market rate.

The other glaring issue is age.  Charlie Munger is 97 years old and Gerald Salzman is 80 years old.  Beyond not being at the forefront of technological innovation on a personal level (some may view this as an issue when running a Saas business, personally I am not concerned as there job is to manage the people driving the Saas business), their old age means that in the coming years, their leadership may cease to exist.  No clear succession plan has been identified (this was raised during their last annual meeting by a concerned shareholder).  As management is a key strength within this business, this could be reason for pause for prospective shareholders.

Lastly, there is the $16 billion elephant in the room.  Tyler Technologies is their key competitor.  There are other smaller competitors who offer more limited solutions, but Tyler Technologies is the real competition in this space.  While their products are more modern and (likely) have better and flashier features, this is not necessarily what wins in RFP processes.  Instead, the Daily Journal’s practice of not charging the client until launch is a much more appealing catch for prospective clients.  While I’m sure Tyler Technologies will be a fine company in the long-term, its hard to argue that their fundamentals are nearly as attractive as the fundamentals of the Daily Journal.  The Daily Journal is valued at 8x sales, has a P/B of under 2, and has a P/E of 3.5.  By comparison, Tyler Technologies has a P/B of 8, is valued at 14x sales, and has a P/E of 91.  Tyler Technologies would need to continue growing at a very rapid pace to be a strong value investment (note that Tyler Technologies is still rapidly growing, though this rapid growth is slowing).  By comparison, the Daily Journal, if it continues at its current growth, is already a great investment.  As most clients are onboarded, growth is increasing and it is my belief that this will be a phenomenal investment.

SEC REG SHO is being abused at NOVC.

Maryland MD Corp Novation Companies $NOVC allow Fortress & EJF Capital to own both 31.3M 27% of common and own only Sr Debt. Appearance is they use Debt to buy/take shares at pennies Read 

This allows a new investor to turn $240,000 into $300,000,000 plus reap & annual dividends up to $33,000,000/year.

Why does Fortress/EJFcap/ Igdaloff/Gillman/MassMutual Barings/Thomas Akin w/ 77% of Novation Companies, Inc. $NOVC common create the portrait that NOVC will waste $730M NOLs & Rights that control collateral assets to most of $3 Billion RMBS 6% WAC Portfolio? They have successfully reorganized public companies just like $NOVC including $DX/$NRZ/$DS/$COOP/$CMO/$OMF/$SNR/$IMH. 

I believe their plan has been to drive NOVC share price down via false narrative while at same time giving themselves almost 50M shrs at pennies or less (Fortress, EJF Capital are both the economic owners of NOVC only Sr Debt aka Note Holders to exit Ch 11 & be given 31.3M common with no cram down (reduction in principle). Fortress owns CDO Service Rights hold CDOs Taberna I and II holds 2/3rd Sr Debt and therefore 31.3M and EJF Capital owns CDO Service Rights on Kodiak CDO One 1/3rd of Sr Debt and therefore 31.3M shares, see below. Fortress and EJF Capital paid virtually nothing to own these CDOs same year DX investors joined NOVC Board 2010. This is itself an oxymoron since no investor can pursue the interests of both Debt and Common Equity at same time. NOVC Board is led by Fortress’ past co investor at Dynex Capital NYSE $DX Barry Igdaloff, Chairman. In addition to awarding Note Holders 31.3M shares at less than one cent, he has converted Board compensation at pennies into 18M RSUs restricted stock units aka common). Fortress & EJF Capital are the economic owners of all of NOVC only Sr Debt (Note Holders) to exit Ch 11 April 2019 with $6.3M cash & no cram down reduction in principle. August 2019 NOVC Board led by Barry Igdaloff, Chairman gave Note Holders 31.3M NOVC Common at less then one cent; 9M common at zero + 22.250M ten-year warrants at one cent strike aka zero see [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novation-companies-inc-executes-first-202127796.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novation-companies-inc-executes-first-202127796.html) Igdaloff allows Fortress & EJF to conceal their identities behind CDOs that own both the largest common positions 31.3M 27% and all of NOVC only Sr Debt. No disclosure has ever been made in SEC filings of the Sr Debt true economic owners, let alone their past DX co investing relationship with NOVC Board. This omission of transparency needs to be including in the SEC “Schedule of Beneficial Ownership”.

I believe NOVC has used Sr Debt as fodder to drive share price down while they convert 50M common at pennies. By concealing their true restructure plans they rent GAAP and AICPA reputation of top 200 CPA firm to create a false narrative including “Going Concern”.

I believe these investors will make billions by doing what they have done many times before, especially $DX and $DS aka $NRZ/$SNR/$GCI, $COOP, $IMF & $OMF. Their end game is not only creating billions but creating annually hundreds of millions in cash flow off dividends and lucrative management fees. I believe they really plan to split Novation Companies, Inc. $NOVC into at least two tax exempt/tax free public companies like they did at DS/NRZ/SNR/GCI. 

This allows a new investor to turn $240,000 into $300,000,000 plus reap & annual dividends up to $33M/year. Allow me to explain below:

$NOVC holds; $730M NOLs just like other Fortress companies:

o $COOP Mr. Cooper Fortress Wesley Edens merged COOP $3.8B with Fortress owned Nationstar formerly traded $WMIH/$WAMU $7B NOLs

o $DX Dynex Capital holds $120M NOLs. Fortress reorganized with NOVC Chairman of the Board Barry Igdaloff 2000-03 with his cabal (Igdaloff and his cabal own at least 40M NOVC Common). Fortress owned 100% of Capstead which camouflaged Fortress $DX ownership. Edens flew to Columbus OH 2000 to visit with Mr. Igdaloff (I know because Igdaloff told me so).

o $DS Drive Shack holds $160M NOLs See Wesley Edens $DS Shareholder Presentation Dec 2016 (see attached) which shows Fortress restructured Newcastle Inv Corp ex symbol $NCT by separating out 3 tax exempt MREITs (SNR, GCI, NRZ) before changing the name from Newcastle to Drive Shack $DS.

It is my belief based on SEC filings that no investor will make a dime off of NOVC Sr Debt but the 31.3M shares could be worth billions & generate hundreds of millions in annual dividends and management fees as follows:

Fortress, Wesley Edens, CEO & EJF Capital, CEO Emanuel J. Manny Friedman are world class MREIT, NOL, CCR cleanup call right investors, they must be motivated to create annual dividends and lucrative management fees out of rights per NOVC signed Service Rights Transfer Agreement Sec 5.04 (see back of NOVC 10Q Q3 2007). This is just what Fortress Wesley Edens, former Head of MBS Desks at both Blackrock and Lehman Bros did at tax exempt MREIT $NRZ www.newresi.com (per 2020 NRZ 10K shows Fortress collected $190M in one year from NRZ shareholders including $170M management fees plus tens of millions in NRZ dividends). 

NOVC can separate Novastar Financial Inc. former top 10 MREIT traded on NYSE symbol NFI. NFI can monetize tax exempt most important the nuclear fuel to duplicate past reorganizations especially at $NRZ/$DS, $DX ...etc. aka Cleanup Call Rights (well known to MREIT experts above). These rights are well defined in NOVC signed Service Rights Transfer Agreement Sec 5.04 (attached to this email and to NOVC 10Q Q3 2007). Novastar Financial Inc. was saved by NOVC Ch 11. The Service Rights Transfer Agreement Sec 5.04 (ex-symbol NYSE NFI) provide Cleanup Call Rights CCR rights that control most $3B Billion RMBS Portfolio of collateral assets that carry 600 Bpts weighted average coupons (these collateral assets are rich and seasoned and can be leveraged/resecuritized at estimated 500 Bpts NIMs into Annual Dividend). $NOVC 2020 10K creates a subtle deception or misleads investors & Mr. Market by stating the current value of these rights page 25 of 10K. It is the future plans to use these rights aka control over rich, seasoned collateral assets that matter to NOVC future reorganization not current value that counts. To illustrate NOVC NFI holds rights to 3B portfolio see [www.novationcompanies.com](http://www.novationcompanies.com/) for Bond Remittance Reports and Edgar Reports for Pooling Service and Trust Agreements. MREIT experts understand CCR are triggered once the Bond Balances hit 10% of original face value. CCR allow NOVC to access the collateral assets (Quants call CCR the “2nd Bite of Apple) which must be taken out at par, unless NOVC or an agent like Fortress buys the actual bonds back at discount. The Bonds are owned by many different investors that are probably unaware of the CCR. Imagine accessing 3Billions of collateral assets for 1.5B or half. The collateral assets can be leveraged (DX and NRZ use 15:1 in normal market) this creates at $45B portfolio which given current market conditions can produced NIMs think Gross Margins (Net Interest Margins of 500 Bpts) 45B x 5% = NIM of $2,300,000,000 less some SGA and Loan Loss Reserves. NOVC will require capital to execute which I believe is pre agreed to or quid pro quo between MassMutual and sub-Barings own 19.3M shares and Note Holders Fortress and EJF Capital own 31.3M shares and Barry Igdaloff cabal own at least 40M shares. This quid pro quo is defined in NOVC approved Proxy 14A filed Oct 2018 pages 11-15 that prices one NOVC Common Rights at $2.33/share (exactly MassMutual and Barings cost basis $48M invested dividend by 19.3M shares per 10K. 

NOVC second entity can be operated tax free as www.healthcare-staffing.com HCS which can use $730M NOLs. HCS produces between $50M and $61M in gross revenue (margins of 36% with high credit customers), has a high regulatory moat in Community Service Bureaus market in state of GA. I debriefed with several leaders that suggest HCS should expand into TX and VA that operate CSB just like GA. One of the leaders provided an unsolicited quoted by David Pointer, HCS and NOVC CEO as stating to 6 HCS Managers “You should buy NOVC ASAP as we have a plan to turn it around, especially while it still trading at pennies”. In addition, this same HCS leader quoted Mr. Pointer as saying we want to grow HCS very slowly. It is my belief Pointer was expressing a directive from Note Holders and Barry Igdaloff to time future HCS growth only after they had collected at least 50M shares at pennies. 

Conclusion if Novation Companies, Inc. $NOVC separates NFI like Wesley R. Edens, COB did at Newcastle Inv Corp $NCT aka now called Drive Shack $DS Note Holders stand to make billions and generate hundreds of millions in annual management fees & dividends. Drive Shack $DS web site holds Mr. Wesley Edens’ presentation Dec 2016 to DS shareholders attached. Slides 4-5 spell out his aka Fortress’ restructuring at Newcastle $NCT/$DS www.newresi.com $NRZ which paid Fortress in 2019 alone $2.00/share annual dividend in addition to Fortress lucrative management fee $170M in one year alone. Could NOVC generate estimated annual dividend $2-6/common share? May be pay Fortress/EJF or combination another new 1.5% Mgt Fee like Fortress collects annually at $NRZ. Remaining or 2nd company HCS www.healthcare-staffing.com can operate tax free with $730M NOLs aka gravy just like Drive Shack $DS was to Newcastle Investment Corp ex symbol $NCT. These investors led by Fortress, EJF, MassMutual and Barry Igdaloff own 90.6M NOVC common (19.3M+31.3M+40M) and I and small count of investors own at least 30M NOVC common totals 120.6M versus NOVC 10K for 2020 shows only 115M common shares outstanding. Over 60M shares have traded over the last year (45M just since 2020 holidays) on no news, Going Concern and Form 4s which I believe are private transfers or parking shares at family and related entities.

984,2021-05-28,investing,"My game is fantasy football using NFTs.  
We started the project in January.  
We have game design, card art, card animation, card packing/unpacking/storage, landing page, legal counsel, a CTO, social media established, custom API for scoring. That has taken five months and $50,000.  
I have enough money to get us to launch and make the game succeed but we will start with bare bones gameplay: users can receive our sign up bonus, buy, sell, trade, and use cards (NFTs), players can enter tournaments, be paid, and have their rankings saved. Basic functions.  
There are dozens of ancillary options that I could focus on now, if I had additional funding. Mainly League Play. Fantasy League Play is as big as Daily Fantasy Football.  
I have income projections, Statements of Work, and a Lawyer with a degree from Harvard and Michigan making sure we stay compliant and things are fair and transparent. We will have an evaluation done late July. We expect to have a two-million dollar evaluation. I can provide details.  
I have options for any investor type, starting at $10,000.  
Message me for specifics.  
Here is my game, decide yourself whether it has any potential. [https://www.nftdraft.io](https://www.nftdraft.io/)",nmyio4,[],0
