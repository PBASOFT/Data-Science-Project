But humans aren‚Äôt meant to have sex before marriage because of feelings like this and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a sin. If you renew yourself as a Christian through God, you gain a whole new meaning to sex and look at women a totally different way. Forget about her since you cheated on her. No changing that.

44,gzpinlo,2021-05-28,t1_gzpfvyj,wallstreetbets,"Market Makers sell us the call options to buy the stock at $25 as opposed to $28 (if the stock price is currently at $28). If we exercise the call options, that means we are requiring the Market Maker to deliver us the shares as promised by the options. Market Maker has a few days after whoever exercises (it could be me who exercises, or anyone who subsequently buys the call options from me) the options, to deliver the shares to the exerciser. If Market Maker does not have enough # of shares in their inventory, they will need to go get it. Problem to them is, the stock price may keep going up during those few days (although it may go down). In an uptrend movement of stock price, Market Makers are now scared because they think the stock price might be let's say $50 tomorrow. Then the Market Maker has to pay $50 to buy those shares from the market and deliver those shares to us who are paying $25 only. That would be a huge loss to those Market Makers so they may want to start buying these stocks earlier before the price gets to the $50 or whatever, even $30. This creates the buying demand and is what's so called gamma squeeze. Then this may in turn create the short squeeze because short sellers, who want stock price to go down, are now observing stock prices go up, and they feel their own separate need to buy the shares back before the price gets up too high (if price gets too high, the lenders will require the short sellers to either pay them back the lent shares, or pay CRAZY HIGH interest or additional collateral since if the shares were paid back, the lenders wouldve been able to sell those shares at high-price but are not able to because short sellers still want to keep them. So, lenders charge more money and short sellers at one point cannot keep paying interest and give up, start buying shares to pay back the investors, and thus another buying demand is created; such is short squeeze).

Even experienced traders have difficulty beating index funds. Seeing massive gains in here can be misleading because of survivorship bias: they often (with exceptions) also have massive losses from high risk trading strategies like buying options that can average out to a loss.

Alright retards listen up this is a huge play that keeps getting auto-modded out because of market cap but it's on fire, still cheap, and institutional and HFs are buying it on value.

The ticker is Ay Dee Eee Ess.

Stock has been beaten down, with a current market cap under 200mm, despite the fact that they have 60mm in net after-tax revenues remaining for 2021. They also have a state of the art manufacturing plant built in 2010 for 400mm, which is finally operating at a profit.

And as of Q1 this year, their Cash on hand was greater than their outstanding debt. The balance sheet is shaping up beautifully. 

Retard math:

400mm plant built in 2010, say it could be liquidated for 200mm

60mm in guaranteed govt incentive a/t cash flow left in 2021

Estimated 10mm ebitda in 2022 from newly signed CABOT deal

Newly acquired water purification segment saw positive ebitda for the first time this quarter, about $2mm

$200mm + $60mm + $10mm + 2mm / 19mm shares

$14.31 in liquidation value based on immediate financials. No debt.

Why is this stock only 8 dollars?

It was picked up in VIC last week and the stock has been running ever since. Cool to see one of my ideas picked up by real time traders!

So tomorrow? I'M GONNA GET AIDS (that is, a d e s). Shit has nearly tripled from lows earlier this year and I don't believe it's even at liquidation value yet.",[],1

Said theory is being published in a journal.  On an unrelated note, Mochizuki is the chief editor of that journal.  We call that one proof by conflict of interest.

A legitimate quote from the paper is ‚ÄúEach of the co-authors of the present paper would like to thank the other co-authors for their valuable contributions to the theory exposed in the present paper. In particular, the co-authors [other than the first author] of the present paper wish to express their deep gratitude to the first au- thor, i.e., the originator of inter-universal Teichmu Ãàller theory, for countless hours of valuable discussions related to his work.‚Äù

2021: $30 - $40
2022: $60 - $80 (or buyout)
2023: $100 - $200 (or buyout)

What are these valuations based upon:
- Continued increasing quarterly sales and patient enrollment of Orladeyo for HAE, with possible +EPS quarters successively to come later this year.
- Starting pivotal trials for BCX9930 (Factor-D) in 2H for PNH patients, resulting in blockbuster results in 2022.
- FDA approval for use of Factor-D for PNH patients by early 2023.

These estimates do not factor in other drugs in their pipeline. Those will be added to the valuation if/when they mature.

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",['AI'],0

It wouldn't surprise me if decades down the line, we get the truth that some billionaire called in a favor at the DTC to orchestrate the halting of retail buying pressure.

It's unprecedented that buying stocks with cash were halted for retail. While we were locked out, HFs got to reposition and or make profits.

Separately, these crooks dropped the stock price by 77% with 8 million volume. There is material damage done to retail.

> hedge funds, brokerages and the SEC would change the rules again before the squeeze approached

Ah so like they are right now?

Bottom line isn't preventing a squeeze, that is honestly impossible with a short interest higher than issued shares. It is about preventing the liquidations and margin calls from nuking the rest of the economy. 

Hence the OCC, SRC, and DTC rule changes. No more liquidating to few buyers, any entity can bid, and higher margin requirements. 

Trading is a zero sum game. If the hedgies that are short GME lose, someone else is eating their lunch. 

Naked shorting isn't just an attack on a specific stock, it is an attack on the entire market. Citadel et all have lowered everyone's stock by aggressively, illegally, shorting specific stocks. 

Take GME for instance, one of several stock they naked shorted.... Shorting GME with naked shares is a secret dilution of the GME share price. Any funds, indexes or firms holding GME also suffer that slight dilution. Those indexes are also lower. The S&P is lower. SPY is lower.

Everyone's retirement accounts are slightly lower. 

These fucks have went around entrenched establishment powers (Citadel is the newer kid on the block after all) and diluted **everyone's**, yes, **everyone's** assets. And that is just one stock. 

Ever naked short is essentially an invisible unknowable tax on every American's, nay- every investor the world over's, assets.",['GME'],0

RH has an amazing user interface, which makes trading through the app very accessible. But, it restricted buying of GME, AMC, and ""meme stocks"" in January, and it is likely to do it again based off of its business model.

Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, Vanguard, any of the established ""boomer"" brokers will be far more reliable on the back-end. Because they are much larger than RH, they have the liquidity/leverage to handle the MOASS. But their apps suck. Fidelity's beta-testing one now, but no news on when it will be released.

In essence, RH is a go-kart and Fidelity is a Honda Civic. RH is fun and simple! But if I try to ride it to work on a daily basis, it'll surely break down, and I'll eat a lot of bugs on my commute. I would much rather have a dependable and trust car.","['GME', 'AMC']",0

7474,gzpw5qb,2021-05-28,t1_gzp8dds,wallstreetbets,"> AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. capped its best trading session in four months, pushed higher by eager retail investors who celebrated vaulting the company‚Äôs market value to a record $13 billion on social media.
> 
> Shares soared 36% to $26.52 as 691 million shares changed hands, in the busiest day since January for the Leawood, Kansas-based company. The four-day rally more than doubled its stock price, pushing its year-to-date gains to 1,150%.
> 
> AMC‚Äôs revival has been fueled by individual investors eager to save the movie theater industry after it raised more than $1 billion in financing to avoid bankruptcy over recent months.
> 
> Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron has embraced the Reddit-fueled rally and talked to new retail investors on conference calls. The stock has roughly tripled since AMC reported quarterly results on May 6, adding $9 billion in value. Thursday‚Äôs milestone stands out against a market value bottom of $216.8 million which was hit in April 2020.
> 
> AMC Entertainment's market value has soared to a record amid retail mania
> While Chad Beynon, an analyst with Macquarie Securities, is waiting for AMC to continue to shed debt and lease obligations before getting more constructive on shares, he acknowledged the mania individual investors can create.
> 
> ‚ÄúThe Reddit crowd is strong, the volumes have been off the charts lately, so there‚Äôs clearly demand that wasn‚Äôt there pre-Covid,‚Äù he said by phone. The company‚Äôs ability to raise cash at over $10 a share earlier in the month ‚Äúmarked the first time the company was able to financially benefit from the Reddit rally,‚Äù he said.
> 
> The cash AMC has raised through the sales of hundreds of millions of additional shares is a key driver for the massive run-up in market value despite the stock actually trading down more than 25% from a 2015 peak. More than 490 million shares of AMC are currently available for trading, data compiled by Bloomberg show, almost ten-times the 52 million shares outstanding at the start of last year.
> 
> Number of AMC Entertainment shares has soared as the theater raised cash
> More Capital
> Debt tied to AMC has rallied alongside shares, setting new highs in recent days. The company‚Äôs bonds, which were trading at a low of 5 cents in November, are inching close to par, according to Trace trading data. That debt carries a hefty coupon of 12% for the notes due 2026.
> 
> AMC‚Äôs bonds were among the top performers in the U.S. high-yield market on Thursday, extending gains from earlier in the week.
> 
> The company said previously it might seek more financing, and some investors have suggested it sell more shares to pay down or look to refinance its more than $10 billion debt load.
> 
> The cinema chain ‚Äúwill carefully examine the raising of additional capital in whatever form we think is most attractive‚Äù and is focused on de-leveraging, Aron said on a call to discuss fourth-quarter results in March.
> 
> AMC's bonds reach record high amid Reddit rally
> The company‚Äôs latest resurgence at the hands of individual investors has pushed the market value to more than double its April 2017 peak of $4.17 billion prior to this year‚Äôs trading. Put a different way, AMC has consistently added more than $1 billion in each of the last three sessions -- more than double its value at the start of the year.
> 
> Mark-to-market losses for investors betting against the movie theater chain topped $1 billion this week alone, data compiled by S3 Partners shows.
> 
> The movie theater company‚Äôs ability to post strong box office numbers as it reopens in key markets like New York and California will be important, B. Riley Securities analyst Eric Wold said by phone. Wold downgraded shares to neutral from buy on Wednesday citing valuation concerns.",['AMC'],0

7836,gzpx1m2,2021-05-28,t3_nmg57b,wallstreetbets,"Since we're talking about short interest again, here's a reminder:

If you have a margin account (you get instant settlement, instant deposits, you have to follow PDT rules), and not a cash account (trades must fully settle after several days), then your broker lends out your shares and collects the short interest premium on them.

You agreed to it when you signed up for a margin account. You have a certificate of ownership of the shares, but the shares are in their custody and contribute to their margin pool. Typically brokers let you short from the broker margin pool for free, but if none are available, they can source shares for the rate if you ask.

RH, TDA, Tasty and Webull works like this. Most others do too. If you're buying and holding shares, you aren't starving shorts. I guess you're driving the price up if you take an ask, but if your transaction is merely helping a bona fide hedger dynamically hedge an option, you aren't reducing the share supply.",[],0

8524,gzpydig,2021-05-28,t3_nml65m,wallstreetbets,"1. Traditional ICE engines and drivetrains have limited lifespans and will cost more to make than EV's.
2. No one is ""replacing"" their ICE cars, rather as people are in the market for new cars, many opt for EV's.
3. EV's with million-mile batteries, will last 20 years, versus about 10 years for ICE vehicles (also see point 1 for why EV's will last longer). This will mean total cost of ownership is substantially cheaper for an EV. Further, it will ensure a robust used car market where you can buy 5-15 year old EV's for less than comparable ICE vehicles.
4. Tesla's are built fine. There are some minor panel trim issues that should be resolved with the new builds from Texas and Germany (once the factories are up and running). Inherently the new cars with front and rear single casts will be built to tighter tolerances than any other car out there (it is an inherent property of casting, so going to be hard to beat the quality of those Tesla's if you don't use single large castings as well).
5. Weight will go down significantly with the single casts and the 4680 structural cell. This means more range, better handling, and less wear and tear on wheels and suspensions.
6. Not sure the relevance of other industries if batteries are just better for EV's (recall Mr. Diess of VW has agreed that pure battery is the way to go).
7. The switch to electric seems to be going as fast as Tesla can make them. Tesla is also making home battery packs and solar panels which are increasingly being rolled out which help make the grid more robust and support more EV's.
8. If you can switch to synthetics now, than might as well, but no reason it should stop the move towards EV's. Further, the idea that you can make synthetic fuel efficiently is based on having access to green energy, but you point (#5 in your list) says the electric infrastructure is not there... The thing is, making hydrogen takes about double the energy you get  out of it, so to go to synthetics you need your grid to be double what it needs to be for BEV's, which is where I will stop with this, as trying to think through the apparent contradictions this raises is causing my head to hurt.

Basically, Tesla will have incredible growth and any attempt to move to synthetics will likely result in a massive failure as it makes no sense to build vehicles that use that if you can make them BEVs instead.",['TSLA'],1

I also need to read the 8K about their new debt covenant, and one or two other things. I did notice one or two things I liked, however. 

With the market cap of this company as small as it is, any meaningful shareholder appreciation in a very quick manner will lead to new share issuances, diluting existing shareholders, for one. They need the cash, and they need it badly. 

Another thing i noticed, is that they are all about being positive EBITDA wise, but that doesn't help when we're talking about net income. And I don't see even how they become Cash Flow Positive on an EBITDA basis anyways.

With that said, they have a lot of money in inventory, and in pre-paid expenses, so they have a bit of runway still.

(2) The shorter moving average (ema 50) crosses up through the longer moving average (ema 200) with a spike in trading volume with good momentum (RSI), signaling a change in trend. (3) Finally, the continuation of an uptrend, leading to a higher price (We are potentially at this point!).

Ok, so this assume Roth 401k. 
 
One of the ways Roth is good is if you expect your withdrawals to be about or greater than your salary (with some leeway because who knows what tax rate is when withdrawing).

So if u started putting these acts into your Roth IRA at 22yrs old till retirement you will have $287,000 that you can withdraw at retirement without having to pay taxes. If you invested it wisely you will pay capital gains tax on gains when withdrawing above and beyond the 287k. 

A 401k allows you to pre tax withdraw up to 50% of your income and if you are lucky your company matches a bit. My company match is 6%. 

I pull 10% of my income through the 401k program. I thankfully have a nice job that pays well so I contribute the measly 6k into my IRA and the rest into my personal investment account with post tax $ .

But I will never buy into the idea that avoiding profit in order to avoid taxes is a good thing. I understand that if it just happens to happen, it is a true thing. But the idea put forward that selling shares when they are low is a good thing because he makes less money, so then he owes less taxes...no. It's not a GOOD thing. It's just a thing.

I'm sure if you asked him, he would rather the timing work out so that he is selling at the highest price possible and he'll deal with the taxes.

If I owe a million in taxes, there are 3 potential outcomes of coming up with that money via selling stocks.

1) I sell shares I bought at break even price. This is a net cost of 1 million to pay my taxes.
 
2) I sell stocks I bought for 2 million at a 50% loss and save myself $400,000 on next years tax bill. This nets me a cost of 1.6 million to pay a 1 million tax tab. 

3) I sell stocks I bought for 500,000 for 1 million. This increases my tax bill for next year by 200,000 resulting in a net cost of 700,000 to pay my 1 million tax bill.

For him it sounds like there is a 4th option..selling shares that have a cost basis of zero, so it's all profit. Let's call this option ""3b"".  

The higher the price I sell them at, the better. Fewer shares needed to get to 1 million.

No matter what the share price is, I still I need 1 million dollars to pay my tax bill. If it's all going to be counted as 100% profit then all a lower share price does is force me to sell more shares. 

I would personally prefer option 3 and have a net cost of 700,000 via taking a profit (and dealing with the resulting tax bill next year) instead of 'avoiding taxes' and ending up with a net cost of 1.6 million while avoiding 400,000 in taxes. Or option 3b for him...selling 1 million worth of shares that I got ""for free"" and ending up with a 400,000 tax bill next year. No matter how you cut it, the government is taking 40% of the shares he sells. I would rather they take 40% of a big number than 40% of a small number. 

There are a few situations, for normal people, where making a charity contribution or taking some other type of loss (in order to change the income bracket that your long term capital gains will be taxed at) does make sense. But this guy is no where near those income levels. If I recall, the highest tax bracket is still around 400,000 a year isn't it? He's not getting to the one below that. And as I think you pointed out, none of this is long term capital gains for him, so it wouldn't matter anyway even if he could. 

This is not tax advice, DYODD, not legal advice.. Yada Yada Yada.",[],0

But historically speaking internal oversight shouldn't be the standard operating procedure. Should be like car insurance. Should be external audits and recommendations.)

Lastly, punitive damages with jail time. If I commit fraud and make hundreds of thousands, I'm going to jail and getting someone's banana in my crack. But when a financial institution does it and makes billions and pays settlement with millions, that's baked into their cost of business.

Here's that number put into perspective. 1 million seconds 11.5 days. 1 billion seconds 31.7 years.
