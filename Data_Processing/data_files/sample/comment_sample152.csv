104,gywuq9n,2021-05-21,t3_nguxep,wallstreetbets,"Probably better off considering it from the angle not of who’s going to be supplying SpaceX, but rather who’s going to benefit most from SpaceX-based infrastructure.  Getting things into space is expensive and dangerous and that’s the bottleneck SpaceX is trying to break open, but in doing so they’re going to be the equivalent of railroads in the 19th century and airlines in the 20th, and essentially they’re just transporting things from point A to point B for third parties.  

So, who’s going to be using this infrastructure?  

The first mining company that captures an asteroid loaded with heavy and rare earth metals is going to become incredibly valuable until a second company does the same.  Similarly, anyone who looks at building steel smelting plants operating in hard vacuum will have a uniquely valuable product, as hard vacuum causes impurities to escape to an extent that you wind up with steel an order of magnitude stronger than anything that can be refined on Earth.  To my knowledge, no one has announced that they’re pursuing this, but that’s because the infrastructure isn’t there yet and has been greatly neglected by governmental agencies since the end of the Space Race.  I also expect that such a company will keep their plans for either avenue a close secret until they’re poised to actually implement them, so keep ears open.

A riskier but potentially rewarding bet would be on energy companies and Lunar gas mining.  The possibility of helium-3 being the key fuel for sustaining nuclear fusion with a net gain of energy remains speculative, mostly because it’s scarce enough on Earth to prevent significant testing.  The best reserve of He-3 in reach is locked up in lunar soil, so *if* it turns out He-3 *is* the key to bootstrapping self-sustaining nuclear fusion reactors, whomever gets to the Moon first with the intent of strip-mining it for helium will essentially be the new oil barons, and the energy companies that can build and operate fusion reactors the new energy barons.",[],0

Either friends and family, taking out a loan to cover, or working something out with your brokerage. Similarly, file a repayment plan for your taxes.

Lol you boy has your house and has putting it on the line against Tesla 
He must think we're going to go back to gas and away from EV bc I just realized, I just bought a ford VW A CHEVY A PORSCHE A FISKAR A LUCID A POWER WGEELS JEEP FROM MY CHILD HOOD.
One problem now, I'm on the road, far from home like you know 1 hour and its middle of winter. I'll even keep my location, I don't lve in the most populated city in America. 
I would like to go home but I have  a real problem. I bought a car that cannot be charged anywhere but where ever I am.  So if your friends all have nema 14-50 220v outlets right outside by the curb like all of mine do,...... you’ll be fine , but if you don’t , we’ll then you’ll be doing credit swaps too with the Tesla dealer on a trade in , full disclosure , I bougbt a Tesla for my wife using Tesla proceeds the. At 3000 it split , I said to my self what the hell these guys make140 cars a day Vw made that many whe. Yoh got the the second sentence  Tesla loses money on there cars every other automaker profitable.
What gives?
Oh that’s right a Tesla is now a status symbol that of Mercedes and bmw .
Oh wait thAts not DD however here is some, if yoh want to drive an electric car, underhand yoh are either buying a Tesla or your driving on an extension cord that’s half the range if it’s 95 degrees out of that battery.

If it’s 10 degrees out, we’ll , good luck to you . 
Why are these car companies  not seeing that you can just deliver electricity to gas stations or requires infrastructure, and that’s fine maybe they can build them out quickly but how quickly Tesla is worth more the. All the companies combined 
You can outspend them , they do it without looking , oh look another loss this quarter , perfect stock should pop 20 percent that means .

The service is like the worst you have w ever seen or heard of.
150k car no loaners , Uber credits lmaooooo.
And they come back like it’s crack for share and for cars.

Dr burry - maybe if it was 2008 maybe if we didn’t ha eacxess to the info yoh did then now as regular people 
Maybe if yoy had an EV maybe if you drove around califonaoa which I believe he lives in, you would rwlIe one thing .  Tesla’s are not the only electric cars , they are the only ones people buy if they don’t want to compromise and change them wntire lives based on their cars single charge range .
Imagine I still couldn’t drive to east coast to Miami from NY and not have to go out of my way and not using all the range to keep filling up.  If yoi buy any other EV amd fbat cross Bronx expressway is like  the 5 or the 10 in Cali during rush hour and it’s December 23 , I hope you are either a yankee fan or a fan of beautiful Nj because that’s where tou will get to .  And then to get back , we’ll AAA can come with a gallon of gas to get you to the station that won’t work maybe they can come and tow you to an iPhone charger aomehweee and you can plug in and on NYE you cna get back to your house which was 2 subways and a quick LIRR ride. And then you call dr burry and say can I ha e some money back from my mortgages you made a fuckin killing on Bc my apartment building doesn’t have an EV charger well it does but it’s Tesla only .  
The guys a genus I’m. Jerk off I get it , but he had what one good call and made billions while banks lost and the clients , all the home owners lost there homes instead of getting to keep your house maybe some money back no dr burry made banks sign solvency contexts or be paid first . 
WhTs going to happen here the stock goes to 0 and EVs are no longer the future lol.  This bet will pay out millions foe him I’m sure but if you smart and your a real trader like him yoh j ow you’ll be out of there maybe even on the other side rifbt or wrong .

But the issue here is not the compa y it’s the product the infrastructure and only amazo. And Tesla are tremdendipus companies who were laughed at and my favorite filled with corporate ignorance 


Sure and Jeff bezos was selling used books..... at finite margins and no room for error and crazy logistic to get it done 
Jeff bezos brilliant but not Elon musk brilliant he didn’t change the worlds view on shit except he exploited how lazy us  Americans are is all.
And they ga e 75 -100 cargo planes amazon prime millions of vans and trucks and trailers and maybe one day more planes the. FEDEX  AND UPS .  I don’t see anyone shorting UPS . You think amazo. Will over take them ? I’m sure that actually could but that would be stupid like buying a. Non Tesla EV h less you ha e a predetermined daily commute and plan to use another vehicle for any trips longer the. 100-120 miles 

Then there’s those times you have e no idea where on earth yoh are the gas stations are closed and you panic, we’ll that’s now your daily situation except your down the block from work and everytbings open

Like I said he’ll make million short term, that’s abojt it.
And if he’s lucky Elon musk doesn’t tweet anything 
Kind of ironic the fund is called Scion LOL.
I too rmeber the largest automaker owning a compa y and car called that  too and now the largest automaker makes 4. Cars made to order amd Witb no options the worst service and no loaner cars and they love it 
That’s a little different t the. Offering mortgages to people who can’t afford them 
Quite the oppsiorw that’s shorting mortgages of people that can afford the. Did the homework and Can refuel outside of their driveway 
But what do I know 
Not As much as the good doctor who made more by putting those head lines out through the biggest financial platforms ,using terms like “big shorts fame and The most famous short .  Duh any idiot trying to be really late to the party is going to join thag move and just like in 2008 you’ll ha w no house no account and burry walks aaay Witb all of it and the. Buys Tesla stock

1052,gywxrc7,2021-05-21,t1_gywvy80,wallstreetbets,"Do you know how options work or did you just buy this because you thought it was a moneymaker?

The $220 strike put on GME is trading at 67.38. Meaning if you wrote the contract (sold a put), you would get $ 6,738 right now in premium. Yours to keep. Yay! 

The contract however means you are responsible for buying 100 shares of GME at $220 a share if exercised ITM. 

Because it is ITM, if you sell one, you will be most likely be assigned unless GME rockets. And the $220 put is OTM on 7/16. 

That means you need $220 x 100 = $22000 available to secure that contract sale. 

But wait! You bought a put! You have the right to sell 100 shares of GME at $210. If you exercise the put, you can sell the shares your sold put force you to buy (the $220 strike one). 

Essentially limiting your loss when expiring ITM to the difference in strike prices x 100, or $1000 in this case. So your loss would be  $1000 + $8052 = $9,052

This is offset however by premium gained by selling the $220 strike put. You got $6,738 for the contract, so $9052-6738 = $2314 as your maximum possible loss. 

You are essentially switching to a bullish position, because if GME goes up and these contracts both go OTM by expiration, guess what? You just make $6738 selling a put credit spread that went otm.",['GME'],0

1583,gywzaon,2021-05-21,t1_gywt1zd,wallstreetbets,"You are correct. He probably shouldn't have said ""shares"" because ""shares"" usually refers to stock, not options. $9.25 is indeed the current premium, ie the current price of the call options (quoted on a per/share basis, even though each contract is actually for 100 shares of the stock).

So basically, today, you could buy the same option contract (same strike and expiration date) for $9.25 that he paid $15 a while back. So why has premium (option price) gone down? For an OTM option, there's a few reasons:

1) Stock Price: the stock price hasn't moved up substantially. Obviously the closer it gets to $300 (or above), the more likely his call is to end ITM.

2) Time Decay: Time is ticking away. For an OTM contract, the more time remaining before expiration, the higher the chances are that the share price will make its way into the money before expiration. Think of it this way: what are the odds GME breaks $300 in the next day? Not good. What are the odds it breaks $300 during the next 5 days? Not good, but definitely higher. Maybe even 5 times higher? What are the odds it breaks $300 in the next 100 days? Definitely higher still (although probably still low). So the longer the time remaining on an option, the more likely the stock price will move before expiration, because it has more time available to move. Thus, as time ticks away, if the stock price isn't moving favorably (such as staying flat), then the value of the option is going to decrease. You can see this in the options chain. Options with expirations that are further out have higher premiums (more expensive).

3) Expected/implied volatility: If an option is currently OTM, the odds of it going ITM is also a function of the expected amount of volatility in the stock price. A stock price that is wildly bouncing all over the place certainly has a higher likelihood of moving far enough to get ITM than a steady stable boring stock price. The steady stable boring stock price is most likely to just stay where it's at (OTM in this case) and thus expire OTM (worthless). So, expected volatility affects premiums. So, if he bought the OTM calls when volatility was high, he paid a higher premium because that volatility increased the chances of his calls ending ITM. So now, if GME had flatlined and shows no signs of big moves in either direction, that will hurt the value of his options. On the other hand, if news leaked that a big board announcement is coming up, or perhaps an earnings release is coming up, or suddenly GME starts getting more attention again and the stock gets a lot more volatile, those would all increase expected volatility, which would cause his options to rise in value, since now there is a higher likelihood of a big stock price move that could put his options ITM before expiration.

So there you have it:
1) stock price relative to strike
2) time remaining until expiration
3) expected volatility

Changes in any of those will change the value of his calls.",['GME'],0

If you think about the math it would have told you this was a bad play to hold that long. If I buy your option right now, for 60 bucks, I'm out 6,000 and the price difference at the moment is 4,000. I'd lose 2k unless it dropped further. There's still some time value to try and make some profit but since this stock keeps trading sideways for weeks with some spikes up, it's a losing proposition for me.

Now cheap FDs for intraday scalps.... risky as fuck but more likely to print some money over yours.

I would sell that thing for a loss and put that 6,000 to work making money back.

I speak from experience. I ate a 8,000 loss on GME... but the 16,000 I got out of it I scalped GME for 4k and now have it elsewhere that is up 12,000. So I'm double what my loss was. Worst part is I could have easily quadrupled it had I bit the bullet earlier and put my money to work. 

Oh well, I was stubborn because my position was actually a money maker it just tied my capital up for a long fucking time unless I ate a loss. Instead of losing 8k I'd be up a good 36,000... instead I'm only up 16. 

So you're losing even more money off of unrealized gains because you're letting it decay on a shit option even if it did lay out days before expiry and for a measly few hundred bucks.",['GME'],0

In my opinion the first thing you do tomorrow is call a Bankruptcy attorney, explain to him your situation. He will most likely quote you around $1500 to retain him plus you're going to have court costs which are around $300-$400 in most statesand they let you pay month to month. Bankruptcy should clear all your debt and once you have retained your attorney any phone calls from creditors or banks will go away once you tell them to speak with him. The Chapter 7 process takes around 3-5 months to complete but once you complete it, you will no longer have any debt. Well, student loans will be with you forever so they don't count. As you're going through the process, go to Myfico forums and search the bankruptcy section. There you will find a step by step on how to get your credit back to 700 within 24 months post discharge. This way you can hit the ground running and get on your way back up. Bankruptcy is the best reset button in the world and trust me there is bright light at the end of the tunnel. If you made it to $1.5mil once, you can do it again. The first thing you need to do is remove this debt.

Also don't worry about people coming into your house to take your stuff or any cash you have. There are loopholes that let you keep everything and your attorney will walk through all of this with you. As bad as you feel right now, just know that this shit is nothing and you will make it back in the future. The knowledge on how to make the $1.5mil is far more valuable than the actual $1.5mil.",[],1

I have NO interest in anyone on this thread losing money. none. Do I love going to the movies and AMC theaters? more than anyone. But they're in trouble - and this isn't FUD - it's facts: They have 11.2B in debt on a 6B (and dropping) market cap and burn 1.2B a year - that's a negative 1.2B revenue. They could sell out every seat for the next year starting tomorrow and they're still fucked. three years in a row, still fucked. They're book value per share is negative 5.13. NEGATIVE 5.13. I literally can't find a listed company with a negative bvps. It's a shock they're still listed on any exchange.

Ok, you say, Why don't they do a share dilution? Because their debt \*IS TWICE THEIR MARKET CAP.\* JEsUs H TittyFucking ChRist , read it again. Their DEBT is TWICE their market cap. I could go on, but all the numbers speak for themselves and none of them are good: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/key-statistics?p=AMC  
  
They're being pumped, and you're going to get dumped, and the best way to make money on this is get out while you have profits/ start buying puts, which \*many\* of us are doing and telling you to do.

The idea that economies are zero sum is an old one. Before we had a field called “Economics” the world was Mercantilist. These were the guys that believed whichever country had the largest pile of gold was the most well off, regardless of the actual productive output of the nation or well being if the people. Mercantilists and their failures have been the punching bag of economists since Adam Smith debunked them in 1776. Your belief system is over 245 years outdated and it would be gloating to spend time dunking on you. Regardless, thank you for actually engaging and trying to make a point. 

To your later points, you are mistaken if you think the world is more unequal than it was even a hundred years ago. I am sorry that you have fallen for someone’s trick. The wealth creation by a handful of billionaires is certainly something special, but pointing at it and saying it’s a bad thing without any evidence that it’s created harm isn’t helpful. It reads like jealousy. Your claim that billionaires own 99% of wealth is intentionally hyperbolic. You also claim that the current wealth distribution is obstructing the functions of markets without providing any evidence. Most arguments you could provide on that point would be evidence of policy failure, not a problem with capitalism. Billionaire fortunes are also extremely temporary. It’s well documented that most extremely wealthy families lose their wealth within three generations. The turnover is tremendous.

Why is a billionaires wealth so offensive to you? Is being wealthy bad? If it is, then is being being poor good?

Since you seem genuinely interested in economics I think it’s best to respectfully point you in the direction of accessible resources that might educate you. 

Cheers.

AMC folks - posted this late last night but it bears repeating:  
  
I have NO interest in anyone on this thread losing money. none. Do I love going to the movies and AMC theaters? more than anyone. But they're in trouble - and this isn't FUD - it's facts: They have 11.2B in debt on a 6B (and dropping) market cap and burn 1.2B a year - that's a negative 1.2B revenue. They could sell out every seat for the next year starting tomorrow and they're still fucked. three years in a row, still fucked. They're book value per share is negative 5.13. NEGATIVE 5.13. I literally can't find a listed company with a negative bvps. It's a shock they're still listed on any exchange.  
  
Ok, you say, Why don't they do a share dilution? Because their debt \*IS TWICE THEIR MARKET CAP.\* JEsUs H TittyFucking ChRist , read it again. Their DEBT is TWICE their market cap. I could go on, but all the numbers speak for themselves and none of them are good: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/key-statistics?p=AMC  
  
They're being pumped, and you're going to get dumped, and the best way to make money on this is get out while you have profits/ start buying puts, which \*many\* of us are doing and telling you to do. No one here hates you, none of us have any vested interest on you losing money, none. I DON""T WANT A SINGLE PERSON ON THIS THREAD TO LOSE A CENT ON AMC. It actually breaks my heart. But a lot of institutions do want your losses. You think that was retail/retards yesterday buying 10k share blocks driving the price up? Nope. You're fucked.",['AMC'],0

As for GME, You should have done a bit more reading. It was once a typical failing mortar and brick store being run into the ground like many of it's contemporaries, but a big investor came in, they are doing a remoddeling of their business structure, and they are pretty much debt free and have capital. If their business model works out and they become a big player (they do have the brand recognition and name recognition, even in countries where they aren't active people know the name gamestop) in the biggest sector of the entertainment industry they could end up doing pretty well.

Aside from that brick & Mortar may not be completely dead yet. I know they are transitioning to digital but they will maintain some brick & mortar presence. 

Now why might brick & mortar not be completely dead?

\- backlash against the poor working conditions in digital will probably lead to legislation, the working conditions and low wages of warehouse workers are getting more and more attention. Laws will follow eventually to improve this. Second the delivery process via the post office is also something that can't remain this ""cheap"" and guaranteed ""next day delivery"" in my country the postal workers went on strike shortly before the busiest time of the year when one of our 2 traditional give children gifts holidays was around the corner. Postal workers where angry about immense pressure because of the volume of packages they had to process and demanded higher wages, and that the post hired more staff to relieve pressure. The post had to cave in. I'm pretty sure other countries will see something similar. Digital can't remain Fast and cheap at the same time forever.

\- empty buildings in the streets will probably also lead to government stepping in, Vacancy is a problem that many cities want to see solved. Some legislators are calling for extra VAT taxation on digital purchases for instance and measures to encourage people to shop in the traditional shopping streets. Aside from that after Covid a lot of people are looking forward to being able to go shopping again and see other people face to face and experience the atmosphere of busy shopping streets. And even before covid (again in my country) you saw people online who where looking for specific products, ask specifically on fora and social media for brick and mortar stores and not digital.

&#x200B;

Aside from all this. Let's not forget that GME is a stock that a lot of people are buying because they are expecting a short squeeze to still be in play (I have XXX amount of shares hoping for a short squeeze, but if it never happens that's fine too because of all the reasons I wrote above). Unless thousands of small retail investors are getting disillusioned and lose their faith in the squeeze happening GME is pretty much not your traditional stock since thousands of people are buying and holding regardless of business results or long term business plans. 

And aside from that a lot of the market is acting ""different"" there was a thread on r/stocks that gained traction where someone wondered if the entire market has become a series of pump & dumps with no regard for the traditional mechanics of why one should buy stock in a company. The person gave an example of companies showing good earnings dropping on the market, and worthless and unknown companies or companies with bad earnings shooting up in value. And High frequency trading isn't doing the traditional way of buying and selling stock any favours either.

If you want to know more about High frequency trading there's a 3 part Dutch documentary series (in English) on youtube I'll link it here:

They aren't super complicated but the concepts can seem pretty foreign at first and take a while to wrap your head around, but once you start to get it they are pretty intuitive. 

Here's a short list of questions you should be able to answer before you start trading options.

1. What is the difference between a Call and a Put

2. What are the potential benefits of buying a call VS buying shares. What are the risks?

3. What are the potential benefits to selling Covered calls on the shares you already own? What are the potential downsides.

4. What are the two main uses for buying Puts?

5. What does it mean to sell a cash secured put? What are the pros/cons of doing so?

Buy stock B.  Sell stock B for a $5 loss.  Buy stock B again within 30 days.  The initial loss is rolled in to lower your current cost basis.  Sell stock B for another $5 loss, cementing your retardation and membership on WSB.

It doesn't matter what you gained/lost on stock A earlier in the year. It doesn't matter what you gain/lose on stock C later in the year.

Wash sales only impact the cost basis of purchases of the same stock within 30 days of realizing a loss on that stock, preventing you from claiming a capital loss on it.  Once that position is closed (and not purchased again within 30 days), it'd standard cap gains/losses as usual.",[],0

You can then use LIDAR data to verify that it is calculating depth correctly, if yes then you are good, if not, then use the LIDAR depth info and the vision info to retrain the NN to correct the how depth is computed.

Basically, it helps the system label and validate data at the training level and has nothing to do with the cars being able to self-drive.

3187,gyx7rtl,2021-05-21,t3_nhhgrw,wallstreetbets,"Mate, you obviously don't understand how an option contract works. You are not really suffering from price movement (delta), it looks like you're losing because of time decay (theta)

There is something called time decay in options (among other things), meaning the value of the options exponentially decays in value in the last 1-2 months until expiry and it will converge to the intrinsic value i.e. the value of the stock and your strike price. one way to think of this is your option contract will lose 2/3 of its time value in the last 1/3 of its life and the value of the options is made up of time and intrinsic value.

if you ever want to speculate again, best to buy longer-dated options, at least 2-3 months longer than the expected event. e.g if you expect some news to happen in July, you should be looking to buy the September/October dated contracts so that you have time to get the heck out if the 'event' does not occur with some of your money (approx 2/3 of the time value).

&#x200B;

good luck in the future and better luck next time.

It has made a very bad partnership in the past and there is an ongoing trial on that, where Sorrento is expected to get compensation of somewhere between 200 mil to 1 bil dollars. So that was a mistake, but currently it's expected to bring in some revenue.

Who VOTES for the local effing government in YOUR country?

what is a Democracy for? (run that past me again?) 

WHY are you so PROUD you have a democracy, while all the poor saps in foreign countries who **make your goods for you** suffer under those horrible undemocratic governments?

Because they don't have the right to vote? Because they don't have the choice?

It's a good thing that YOU have the choice, right?.. else you wouldnt be able to put the blame on someone else.

THAT'S what Democracy is for, aint it?

China has an ""exploited workforce"" where the average standard of living (just the average, not by any means 'everyone') has risen 300% in one generation.. compare that to your own?  
And the OTHER reason China has an ""exploited workforce"" is because it has BOUGHT the USA off you .. and now it **owns** you  
 and the USA cant live without it.  
   
Asia took USA economics and learned from it, and beat you at it. Now you are owned.

You just haven't REALLY noticed yet.. you can't quite beleive you ALREADY lost

So keep on voting for the government **YOU want**, that's your right. You aren't ""evil"" for buying cheap goods made by wage slaves, you are just a sucker.

So AAPL is at $127 at the moment, there are $0.14 June 18 145 calls. These are sufficiently high where it's quite unlikely they will ever get called. So you're making 14 bucks per $12'700 invested, which is 0.11%. Doesn't sound great but remember that's only in 4 weeks, there are 52weeks in a year so your 0.11% per 4weeks is 1.4% per year. Not super sexy but you were planning on holding these shares anyway and we picked strike prices that we were comfortable selling.

If you were planning on 10% return with the stocks you gave yourself an extra 14% on your returns by selling these monthly calls.

Of course there's always the risk AAPL will increase by 20% in value and you'll miss out on potential gains. If you're planning on holding the stock this essentially limits your upside in the case you would be making a lot of money (=aapl moons) and increases your average if you were going to make average money (= aapl increases steadily).",['AAPL'],0

But, anyone that is putting all their money into these at these levels are just plain dumb. Could it work? Sure. Likely? No.

In regards to shorting, I think it is dumb and has probably blown up more accounts than it has made. There is a saying that the market can be irrational longer than you can stay solvent. People are going to go broke shorting either one of these.

You want some real DD?

Research his bonus incentive plan which is heavily tied to the market cap of Tesla. All he had to do was keep the market cap over $650mil for 6 months and he would receive a huge payout, which he received. 

The only reason he bought Bitcoin earlier in the year is because he needed to take a gamble on the way to increase earnings for the company. Tesla made more on Bitcoin than it did selling cars in the last quarter. If it wasn't for the $1bil they made on Bitcoin, plus the money they make from selling tax abatements, Then Tesla would have lost money just like they would have every single quarter (they only made money in the last few quarters prior to the Bitcoin investment due to the selling of tax abatements to other auto manufacturers)

The earnings he made from Bitcoin enabled the company to say they were profitable which propped the share price back up. As the share price stays up the market cap stays up.

So if they hadn't made the money on Bitcoin, the share price would have fallen,  which means the market cap would have fallen and then he wouldn't have received that huge payout he received early this year",['TSLA'],0

What you do with that money (ideally) is find a place where it will grow. So if you’re selling stocks at the perceived “top” (where you think you’re not going to go up much further), put the money into something new that has space to climb.

They were on an absolute tear up until the start of the year, and still haven't been hurt too badly. They had just announced that they are building a new renewables business and there's no reason to think they won't be competitive in that space - they can even use much of the same equipment they already have just slightly retooled.

6351,gyxnj0g,2021-05-21,t1_gyxllcs,wallstreetbets,"That news story was a little misleading. 'Short sellers' lost a billy in total because GME rose $10 and AMC shot up $8. They didn't rise because of any squeeze GME just hit support and bounced up and if I had to guess about AMC it was people buying in I'm anticipation of theaters getting ready to reopen. 'Short sellers' in the context of that article are anyone who had a short position, not one single entity. If you had bought a put as a hedge you would he a short seller in that scenario. Shorts lose on their trades when stocks go up.

It also matters at what price short positions are entered at. The January GME squeeze was such a huge deal because in that one instance we caught Melvin Capital with their pants down. They were shorting GME when the stock was already as low as $4. We thought in January when the price jumped to $40 that they would close and we would squeeze to $100 and we would all have been celebrating. Fuck back in November we were speculating that the peak of GME during the squeeze would be $50. That's what squeezes are supposed to look like. This HOLD TILL $50,000 shit is literally garbage.

I can only speak from what I know but in the case of GME when buying was halted MC was able to short at $400, buy back shares while retail buying was halted, enter any other short positions at strategic prices that they wanted, close the $400 short when it dropped to $40 and used that to cover the initial $4 short positions that were causing them to bleed money every day.

So when you see people screaming still about x% still short and shorts need to cover they are only giving you half truths whether they understand that or not. 

I get it, it was really hard for me to realize that the MOASS was over. That was the greatest week of my life. We got to kick some stuck up billionaires in the balls and make them smell our shit. 

Hold AMC because it could be a good growth play for this summer but don't expect it to ever hit triple digits.","['GME', 'AMC']",0

6404,gyxnpe0,2021-05-21,t1_gyxler7,wallstreetbets,"You guys don't understand what a dark pool is and because it has a scary name you're attributing scary things to it. If you were to take your certificate, your physical certificate and hand it to someone else, you would then have to report that to an ADF.

Congratulations, you have now made a dark pool trade. The the real issues of the lack of transparency into brokerage and market structures combined with sec's continual rolling back of rules that would harm short sellers. This allows short sellers to manipulate markets through FTD share creation.

When you put your orders through to someone like Robin Hood they don't send your orders to the market. They send it to the market maker like citadel where citadel gives them a share from their store of reserves from off market and then they decide whether they want to create an FTD share, borrow a short share, or just sell off some of the stock that they're holding in their reserve. This causes the market to go down even though retail is buying because the buy order is go to citadel and citadel fills them either with fake shares or off market shares. 

When the price drops, retail gets scared and start selling their shares back at a loss allowing citadel to replenish the reserves and doing it all over again.

JP Morgan runs the same scam with silver and SLV. When you buy SLV, JP Morgan provides the silver without buying it on the market, then buys it back once futures traders and retail paper hand. That's why you kept saying short squeeze stuff pop up. Eventually if people keep buying pslv and real silver JP Morgan will not be able to do it anymore but that's an aside, I just wanted to show it's a common scam. And it's a scam that could be fixed with transparency. Almost all legalization should be focused on making things as transparent to the general public as possible is the only way to keep it from becoming corrupt.

Credit goes to u/TheYoungPaulBlart for a gift from OG WSB I found in my saved posts. It seems relevant in these dire times:

Stocks only go up


*This economic data looks grim,* I think to myself. *This is the right move.* I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 6/19 SPY 200p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.

I come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&P 500. 2700. Out of its bear market.

I hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. ""What am I-"" 

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he asks.

""Huh?"" I respond, confused.

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he demands, louder this time.

""I, uh... the coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's going to cause-"" **WHAM!** One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.

""It's priced in,"" he says coolly. ""So why did you short the domestic market?""

Dizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&P has climbed back to 2850. *Impossible*, I think to myself. ""Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 20 percent!"" I manage to answer. **WHAM!** Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.

""Repeat after me: stocks only go up,"" Powell demands.

I say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary *guh* escapes my mouth as it falls agape.

Powell frowns and continues, ""I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?""

I feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, ""GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-"" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.

""Stocks only go up,"" Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.

The first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne\_effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect)

Basically ICE car manufacturers hate electrics. Their dealers hate it. Their workforce doesn't know how to produce them

So F decided to build 20k of their electric F150 out of millions of cars they produce every year... why? to do the same shit Microsoft did back in the day.

New innovative company comes on the horizon with product A... so Microshit will annouce product B exactly like A but better and ""to be released at a later time"".

Consumers would wait for B... meanwhile the new company is killed and fails and Microshit picks it up.

Sounds familiar here? we need to spread the word as this is BIG. Bigger than GME... this is about the future of Tesla and other EV makers.

Tesla slipped through the cracks but the legacy shitmakers have a noose for every other startup out there. They realized the existential danger and while Tesla is 600:1 on its valuation there's plenty of nascent EV car makers that are where Tesla was in 2006... and the ICE cabale understands it's now or never to kill them off. Not make the mistake they did with Tesla again.

And maybe if Tesla ends up being the ONLY one left kill it off slowly too by death from a thousand cuts.

We cannot let that happen. Millions of diamond hands need to buy RIDE today and skyrocket it to 100.","['GME', 'TSLA']",1

$80k in net cost for the calls, and there's a total of 33 contracts. 

The cost per contract is about 80000/33 or about $2400. 

The loss per contract on the contracts he sold, provided he sold them at the price shown when he took that screenshot, would have been the 1500 (math) you said. It's just 50000/33.

The statement ""what he paid for them"" is kind of ambiguous. Especially since he locked in the loss on some of them and is still in the others.

I think that was the codeword to sell as if it wasn't at $1 while musk was on SNL he was calling it as the ATH sell code word and suddenly jp chase Morgan head/exec retires from doge profits sounds like conspiracy but timing for fund recovery via doge if musk have heads up he'd Pump dpge before calling it a hustle. I knew before snl most doge was in 20 wallets and the rest were distributed amongst other wallets. So musk and jp Morgan dude are st least 1 of them 20 wallets I'd bet. Investment banking lead exec retiring on a meme token pump and sell/dump.  Right after the original stocks took hedges for billions. Timing seems so ""coincidenal""

Ironically each Vulture species is different and injests different parts of the carcass. literally some eat the bones others eat tissue and others eat what's in between I guess. Realistically to fix our stomach illnesses/diseases I'd say study they're digestive systems across vulture kind and also alligators and  snakes. When you can digest literally all of an animal and we have issues with stomachs just not able to even function normally let alone eating rotting dead carcass bones, organs, tissues.  There chemical process may be different but biologically we can certainly learn how they operate properly with such literal waste as food when even healthy eaters & ppl born with IBD and IBS. Leaving chronic disease our only because they say it's genetic based and bases on what copies you get unlike IBS which is clinical and functional issues without observable causes and IBD has a testing component and may have genetic disposition but seems less straight forward than the Crohn's disease genetic factor. I'm also more focused on internal structural research so my info may be outdated but you can't test for IBS-c/d mixed but have genetic or other testing for chrons (genetically or biopsy) and IBD as the inflammatory markers are present at minimum .

Let's play ""identify the quote bingo"" :

* ""Time in the market beats timing the market.""

* ""So-and-so has predicted 14 of the last 2 market crashes.""

* ""The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.""

Unless you believe capitalism writ-large is going to end within your lifetime, just buy index funds and go to sleep on them.

As soon as you go to cash or shiny metals, you've started down the path of the retired couple whose kids discover $200,000 in cash stuffed in mattresses ""because they were afraid of the stock market.""

That $200,000 from 1980 [could have grown to $6,704,000 with dividends reinvested](https://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator/), by 2021, right through Black Monday 1987, the Dot-Com-Crash, the GFC and 2020's short-lived COVID crash.

Here’s another bingo quote for you:

* “Going back to 1930, if an investor missed the S&P 500′s 10 best days in each decade, total returns would be just 91%, significantly below the 14,962% return for investors who held steady through the downturns.”
