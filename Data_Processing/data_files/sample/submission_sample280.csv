What if a credit related event caused liquidity to dry up. What dividend paying stocks would you buy if there was a 60% haircut on nearly all companies? Leading to dividend yields going up (assuming dividends aren't cut). I would try to avoid companies with debt financed dividend (say Exxon). The risk is that companies can cut their dividend if they have issues with their debt or sales drop off.

Volatility can be your friend if you have cash on the sidelines. 

I'm focusing on companies that have recession proof dividends.

My picks:

Altria, EPD, BTI, EVA, LMNR

Energy, tobacco, farmland

56,2021-05-23,investing," My  current favorite is EPD given its consistent dividend and manageable  debt loads. Their stock price hasn't cratered like the rest. I like the dividend and feel like it would do ok during  times of recessions. Not sure if people had other midstream oil and gas   stocks they preferred. Taxes can be a little complicated as midstream companies usually issue out K-1 reports but Turbotax can take care of that.

545,2021-05-23,investing,"Hello everyone,

I come to explain a strategy i've been applying the last month. All starts [here](https://garudaswap.finance/?ref=0x9F89d55fb6DA62DE6685A3f60F1e845A813D2273), you can check their APRs     on their pools/farms, but that's not what we care about. What we care about is the STORMs section. In this moment, the apr shows ""0"", because they are lowering STORM emmisions (yes, it gives a lot of money), they are reducing it from 60/block to 50/block, not a really big change (APRs still at 200%+, just showing 0!). The interesting thing here, is that you can stake XVS (400%apr+ for example) or any listed there (all with 200% APR) tomorrow, 24/5 APR will be back to normal for you to check, but you are still being rewarded even if showing 0% apr)

**What's the trick?**

Their coin is HIGHLY volatile, if you go to their [main page](https://garudaswap.finance/?ref=0x9F89d55fb6DA62DE6685A3f60F1e845A813D2273) you can notice how their price keeps on dropping (of course, in order to mantain such an inflation) the trick here, is to put the minimum possible amount (of any coin you choosed) in order to be able to withdraw and sell after 1/2 days without transactions fees hurting you (much easier now with BNB at less than 300$) With a coin that has a 300% APR for example, thats 0,82% each day. If we put 1000$ in, we are  getting 8.2$ a day, harvesting n selling every 2 or 1 1/2 days keeps transactions costs extremely low while keeping an insane apr.

The site has 30M TVL, so it doesnt seem to be going anywhere soon.

584,2021-05-23,investing,"To help give the framework of my thought process, I'll use this example: 

-- I purchase $XYZ stock at a share price of $45.00/unit.    
-- $XYZ pays an annual dividend of 3.8%    
-- **For simplicity, let's assume the stock price holds at $45/unit for eternity with no dividend cuts or increases**    
-- Annual yield = 3.8% x $45.00 = $1.71/year

-- If I earn a return of $1.71/year, I should be able to recover my original principle price of $45/unit over time    
-- $45 / $1.71 = 26.31 years

Therefore, based on the above example, I would make the argument that in **26.31 years my annual dividend returns will total $45/unit based on an annual return of 3.8% without change in stock price.**

Is this line of thinking correct?    
Am I overlooking something simple?    
Will the same principle hold for 100 shares? 1,000 shares?

**If this is correct, then why don't we all invest in dividend stocks?** It seems if you are working on any type of 20+-year horizon there is the guarantee of the stock nearly paying for itself. This doesn't even mention the re-investment of dividends or the possibility of dividend increases over that period! _It almost seems to easy...?_

To save some time, I note these drawbacks/limitations to my line of thought:    
1) Dividends can be cut (and they often are!)    
2) Share price can be depressed, in turn impacting dividend yield potential significantly over time    
3) Stock dilution (seems unlikely as most dividend paying firms are stable/blue-chip type companies)    
4) Time in market (hypothesis needs a longer timeframe to play out)


This all seems too simple - please poke some holes in my logic. Thanks in advance!",nj8yzp,[],0

With the increase of renewable energy power systems are gonna face an interesting problem: negative price. 

Negative price is the situation where there is a non flexible demand and a strong non flexible offer. 

In other words, it is becoming very common situation in which the production from renewable is high and at the same time conventional resources like nuclear power or gas power are kept on because the cost of temporary shutting down plants is costly. 

This is a global problem. Countries around the world have been or are gonna be experienced. 

Storage ti offset the grid when there is excess of production can be the solution.

825,2021-05-23,investing,"SPACs might be dead (sorry Chamath), but this one merger has a cult-like following as the buzz around the name continues to grow. This SPAC is IPOE and the merger is with FinTech company SoFi. Brick and mortar banks and queuing in line for services is so 2019, in 2021 this process has become *digitized* and the goal is to have a bank in your *pocket*.

**Banks vs FinTech**

The expansion of financial services and cross-selling of them to existing customers has been a common strategy for traditional banks and finch companies alike. Traditional banks have a massive, already established customer base that they can easily cross sell other financial services to. In fact, the top 15 banks in the world control over 50% of all US bank accounts.

SoFi’s moat surrounds 3 different segments:

1. Lending: Personal/student loans and refinancing
2. Tech Platform: Galileo acquisition and payments infrastructure
3. Financial Services: Investing, credit cards, money transfers, etc

**Galileo**

I want to touch up on Galileo because SoFi’s acquisition of the company was highly strategic and has enabled them to integrate at a larger scale. Galileo is a B2B purchasing/payment platform that works with FinTech entities such as Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, and Revolut. With the Galileo platform, these companies can create complex financial payment processes and enable digital banking solutions. Think of Galileo as the infrastructure behind it all and they are growing by over 100% YoY.

**Trends & Growth**

So why don’t the banks just use their existing customer base to expand into the FinTech industry? Short answer: Because they are BOOMERS. The truth is their legacy infrastructure and IT costs do not help when transitioning into the FinTech space. As per Morgan Stanley, most FinTech startups can actually offer these services at nearly 50% cheaper than the traditional banks.

There are some tailwinds the industry is riding that ranges from more and more customers accessing banking services digitally (this number is even higher among millennials), rise in digital payments by over 20% from 2019 into 2020, and FinTech becoming increasingly popular among personal loans.

SoFi’s customer base has been growing at an average of 66% YoY with their last two quarters hitting 75% growth each. It is no doubt that the platform, the industry, and everything about the business is becoming increasingly popular. Management has noted by year-end 2021 they are expecting to hit over 3 million members (currently at 1.7 million).

**Conclusion**

What was mentioned above paints a picture that FinTech is disrupting traditional firms across all avenues of financial services (loans, investments, and banking). Traditional banks are failing to keep ahold of the new generation of customers coming into the market. SoFi is able to circumvent the inefficiencies in our current financial systems and provide unparalleled customer service for all their services.",njbr4t,[],0
947,2021-05-14,investing,"Note: this post has been expanded from the 5 companies in the title to 11 companies also including Snowflake, Airbnb, Qualtrics, Affirm, Deliveroo and Opendoor. There are a number of other suggestions in the comments of similarly ill-fated IPOs which I could not add for brevity's sake.

11 of the biggest COVID tech IPOs in 7 different categories (cloud, crypto, gig economy, app economy, e-commerce, fintech, and real estate), all crashed following stellar public offerings. Prices rounded to the nearest digit.

* SNOW went down from $430 ATH in Dec to 314 in Feb to 232 on Apr 30 and 185 today.
* COIN sunk from ATH of 429 to 250 after narrowly missing earnings expectations today. At one point on the day of its IPO, retail traders were lapping up COIN for as much as $**429**. I will note though that BTC crashed yday for those unaware. As if ARKK bagholders weren't hurting enough!
* DASH crashed from ATH of $256 in late Feb to $110 yday before reporting a bigger-than-expected loss today. They're up 8% in after-hours.
* BMBL halved from $85 ATH to $39 after beating expectations yday.
* WISH crashed from ATH of 33 to 8 after earnings yday.
* CPNG is down from ATH of 69 to 31 after reporting a higher than expected adjusted loss yday.
* Qualtrics (XM) crashed from ATH of $57 to 29 today.
* SPAC merger OPEN crashed from $39 in Feb to its all-time low of 11 today after Tuesday earnings.
* ABNB crashed from $220 on Apr 28 to $133 after-hours today, down from its ATH of $217 on Feb 11 and up from its ATL of $125. The company announced today that their net loss tripled.
* AFRM is down from ATH of $147 in Feb to 47 today.
* Deliveroo (LON: ROO) crashed from ATH of £3.9 on IPO day to £2.3 on Apr 26 and trades at £2.4 today.

The one newly public tech company that seems to have weathered the storm is Roblox, which reported great earnings on Monday.

But it's not just tech companies that IPOd in 2020-2021. Hot 2019 IPOs Lyft, Uber, Pinterest, and Snap - which - except for Lyft, all reached their ATHs during COVID - saw significant gains during the pandemic, have also crashed since the end of April.

* LYFT tanked from $63 on Apr 28 to 46 today. Previously, Lyft dipped below $23 (ATH is close to $80) three times during COVID, most recently in Oct.
* In the same time period, UBER crashed from $58 to $44.
* PINS is down from 78 to 55 since Apr 27.
* SNAP dipped below $50 from 70 from Feb 23 to Mar 29 and is trading at 50 again today.

972,2021-05-13,investing,"Sorry to bring this up again. I've always believed that despite their low returns, bonds had a role to play in a balanced portfolio. Either to dampen volatility, provide something to rebalance against during the equity dips, improve risk-adjusted returns due to low correlations to lever an optimal portfolio...

This is everything I've heard, but I'm just believing it less and less.

I did a quick test here just on [google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t7xOheId6-4rdjC6HHa-hemlfH7u6SZGT9d6i8cXVYU/edit?usp=sharing). In short here is the performance of $100,000 (dates are rough, not the definitive start and end dates of the period in the titles)

So obviously, having an allocation towards bonds helped during times of crisis, especially in the drawdown period, but not so much in the long run.

Surprisingly, even the added value of being able to rebalancing isn't so definitive versus holding. During prolonged downturns, you're rebalancing more into equities which continue to drop further and faster than your bond component. During recoveries, you may be rebalancing away from equity momentum.

Finally, if the bond allocation is only better than 100% equities during downturns, and if the long-run has 100% equities outperforming, isn't trying to have a bond component for the option to rebalance during downturns almost akin to market timing?

Is the only reason for bond allocation at this point volatility dampening effects? if that's the case should we be looking to cash? or even less correlated assets? or more diversification?

If the drawdowns didn't affect your ability to afford your life, i.e. no need to draw on even 20% of the portfolio for the next 10 years, should we just be 100% equities? Presuming the stomach allows it?

I know this might have been a roundabout way going at what we already have a rule of thumb responses for. ""no need for it if young and high enough risk tolerance"" or ""(120 - age)% in equities, rest in bonds"", but I'm having a hard time seeing even the slightest benefit to it. I haven't shown it here, but it's hard to even create a return/volatility optimal portfolio with it given recent data. Correlations are not as low as they need to be. If you really were a 70-year-old retiree, I would even say bonds don't have enough of a return premium relative to their risk over cash.

I would post this on /r/changemyview if it weren't so topic-specific. Why do you / would you include bonds in your portfolio?

Edit: so just to clarify, I’m not making the trivial point that bonds return less than stocks in the long run, or that they reduce volatility to your tolerance level - I’m just asking for the “pros” to owning them. The argument for being able to rebalance was the most compelling one for me (especially because I don’t have an income to dollar cost average), but I’m noting even that benefit isn’t super strong. 

I might look into the retiree case. I imagine another variable is ratio of expenses to portfolio. It would be interesting to see survival rates of different allocations on a 2 way axis against different expense/portfolio ratios and duration of living off portfolio. Maybe I’ll sim it out later. 

As a side note, despite this post, I do have a fixed income allocation. Granted, it’s levered such that the yield on cash is about 5% (it used to be as high as 12% on investment grade corporates).",nbqj5j,[],1
