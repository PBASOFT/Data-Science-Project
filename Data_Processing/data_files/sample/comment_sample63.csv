What do you think is the reason for the sell off?  It seems the announcement was made awhile ago.  My guess they need the extra money to close the deal.  Looks like the warrants start trading tomorrow is that the reason for the sell off after hours?  Can't be considering everyone must have already known that.  I am not understanding the sell off and even more not understanding the run up in the morning and even more WHY with all that info. did folks not sell in the morning and just buy the warrants tomorrow morning or the commons on the offering at $2.25? HOw did this not immediately go to $2.25 when they annouced the offering?  All the price movement is puzzling to me.

However, your technical analysis on the balance sheet is extremely poor. You are comparing total assets to total CURRENT liabilities not total liabilites which are around $18mil. Still seems high but you should really be comparing current liabilities to current assets. Their current assets are only 2.6 mil to 13.5 mil in current liabilities. This indicates extreme liquidity issues which means this company cannot pay off even its short term debt with their current assets. Again, I believe in the chance for a big gain here based on the revolutionary tech and potential for buyout but their fundamentals/financials are not very strong at all.

548,gzrb628,2021-05-28,t1_gzq086r,pennystocks,"The announcement was just last night; stock crashed below $2 pretty quickly. There are a lot of angles to this.  Book value is a big one, since (in theory) it doesn't make sense to trade below book value. But tell that to ABIO - they've traded at something like 30% below book in the last while. Then there's the the notion of whatever the offering is priced at, that's what the company thinks its shares are worth. The bigger the offering relative to the outstanding shares, the more this seems to apply. But don't forget about the warrants - those have (undefined) value. Plus the company is paying 5% in costs to the underwriters. So they're not really valuing the company at $2.25/share, it's probably a little under $2/share.

All of this is assuming the market is rational and not manipulated. Some people will sell at basically any price to cut ties with a company that drops a brutal offering me this. Some will jump in blindly because they see it dropped like 70%. This stock I'm sure has been highly manipulated to date, and probably will be more so than ever now with the warrants in play.  There are a lot offerings to backtest strategies with; I would recommend looking at what the stocks do in the weeks and months following. They set up opportunities, but jumping in right away is usually a little too blunt of an approach. Make sure to look at some offerings from a time period other than November-February this past year too, as that was an unusual period where the market was actually bullish on offerings.",[],0

610,gzrgjra,2021-05-28,t1_gzkd1ta,pennystocks,"Thanks for your insight.  I think solid state batteries are promising and will certainly have their day.  Personally, I think finding an alternative to heavy metals will be the more immediate benefit for this.  Lithium costs are continuously going up and as the world migrates to all things batteries I think a supply crunch on heavy metals will ultimately make alternatives like this much more cost effective.  Who knows how long that will take, like you said it's too early to compare costs.

From the Forbes article: *""Lithium has risen from US$1460 a metric tonne in 2005 to US$13,000 a tonne this week \[May 2021\], while aluminum‚Äôs price has edged up from US$1730 to US$2078 over the same period.""  (*That's a CAGR of about 14.6% for lithium)

On a side note, I am also invested in closed loop high yield battery recycling as I see the recycling of traditional batteries as an important growing industry.  I'm not counting lithium ion batteries out by any means, It think the world will have such a large need for batteries that the TAM will grow large enough for everyone.",[],1

$CYLC DD So Far
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
SHARE STRUCTURE & PPS HISTORY:
- 82M Shares, 1.5M Float

- Pink Current

- Traded at $25, and $2 Dollars recently/ Currently trading at  .0889(x). Has previously moved up dollars in just a couple weeks

MARKET:
- Looking to become a household name in Cannabis Cultivation (Growing Cannabis) and Hydroponics with the upcoming release of the ‚ÄúKipos‚Äù under Edens Ecosystems 

- Hydroponics is a $1.7B Industry per 2020.

- An estimated 1/3rd of America's marijuana is being grown inside according to motherjones.com.

- One in 3 households are now growing food, this the highest overall participation and spending levels that have been seen in a decade according to the company. Millennials represent a big chunk of this segment, moving from 8 million growers in 2008 to 13 million in 2013. 

-The 2018 National Gardening Survey also found that 15% of U.S. households would grow marijuana at home if it was legal - which has now been decriminalized in 46 States and fully legalized in 16 States. We could see this number increase with a fully Democrat Congress and White House.

COMPANY: 
- History of proven products (Grow Box 5k) in Hydroponics.

- Endorsed previously by GreenCoast Hydroponics - The #1 Retailer of Hydroponic Supplies in the West Coast 

- They are re-entering the Hydroponic, and Cannabis Cultivation Industries with the launch of ‚ÄúEden Ecosystems‚Äù 

- Recently announced on PR that they entered an agreement to produce molds of the Kipos on 02/17/2021

- Recently launched revamped website, 
and started activity on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest with accounts for Eden Ecosystems

- Per Management, they will be releasing a PR about the availability of the product and the finalization of the website in June.

- In a recent PR, they stated that their marketing campaign should fully kick off by the beginning of Spring.",[],0
