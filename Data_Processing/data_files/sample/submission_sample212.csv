https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/nl5l8b/pqeff_third_party_buyer_in_europe_has_filed_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

The only thing that“s bothering me with this post, is that it only focusses on the third party buyer. 

I understand that people in the comments are sceptical about the deal. So am I, but Petroteq‘s potential to be a tenbagger doesn‘t only come from that deal. 

Let‘s do a bit of maths to prove that:

Petroteq runs one oil plant in Utah at the moment. It has recommenced just today:

https://www.google.de/amp/s/www.wallstreet-online.de/_amp/nachricht/13969538-petroteq-energy-announces-that-production-of-oil-from-the-posp-has-recommenced

The oil price per Barrel is sitting at about 65$ per Barrel right now.
They spend 20$ on the process gathering 1 barrel of oil.
That equals to 45$ profit per Barrel.

With their running plant, they can harvest up to 5000 Barrels per day.

5000 Barrels x 45$ = 225.000$ profit per day.

That equals to 82.125.000$ profit per year. 

This does only correspond to one plant! Imagine the profit we‘re seeing with two or three plants. Even with further sinking oil prices, that‘s a huge profit.

At a P/E ratio of 10 that adds up to a MC of around 800Million (P/E better than shell, exxon, etc.)

As of today, the MC is at 50 Million, which means that only with their first plant, the market price is going to rise to a minimum of 16x the one we‘re at now. 

Not only does that explain why a third-party would like to buy a big part of the company for a price 5x higher than the actual one, it also means that we‘re definately going to see an, at least equally big, rise without the deal happening. 

So no matter if the deal is going to happen or not, the potential is huge on this one.
Even if it‘s going to happen, that won‘t be the end of it. 

Thank‘s for your attention and as always, do your own dd.",nm4yvh,[],0

**Looks like a good swing trade here**

  
Rare opportunity for an up and comer in two hot sectors.  
   
Good day everyone,  
   
We are updating our coverage of **SponsorsOne Inc. (OTC: SPONF),** **(CSE: SPO)** a company that works with brands to build and manage exclusive and highly engaged communities of influencers within the social realm and a distributor of alcoholic beverages.  
   
**Current price     $.032/share**  
   
We reported on SPONF April 12, 2021 because the shares were affordable, and **the company had entered the Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) alcoholic beverage market**. We are reporting again today for the same reasons, but with some exciting new developments to include.  
   
We want to note from the [company stock chart](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=SPONF) that on February 19, 2021, after announcing their entry into the DTC alcohol business, SPONF shares hit a high of $.11/share, **355% above the current price**.  
   
These are exciting times for SPONF. There are new sectors that come to market all the time and this company has seized upon two of the hottest ones right now, hemp cigarettes and Direct to Consumer alcohol.  
   
SPONF has [entered the Hemp cigarette (aka CBD) market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sponsorsone-announces-entry-pre-rolled-130000546.html). What is a hemp cigarette? Hemp cigarettes don’t get a smoker high. Hemp cigarettes look and feel just like a tobacco cigarette, but there is no nicotine or toxic additives, and they are made from the flower of hemp plants. **The move into hemp cigarettes may be transformative for SPONF**.  
   
Neilson Research expects the smokable Hemp market to reach $300 to $400 million by 2025, up from the current market of $70M. On March 30, 2021, **SPONF secured a five-year purchase and manufacturing supply agreement and anticipates the first production run of its proprietary Brand to be completed by the end of Q2 2021.**  
   
The FDA and the Biden administration are contemplating a severe restriction on the amount of nicotine in cigarettes, and hemp cigarettes, absent nicotine, may fit with that goal. The FDA started their campaign to get addictive nicotine out of cigarettes in 2018, but it’s just now getting traction.  
   
We told you previously about SPONF entering the DTC alcohol business and their lead product in that market, [Doc Wyler’s alcohol Infused Lemonades](https://www.docwylders.com/). This week the company announced that demand for Doc Wyler’s has been strong enough that they had to [contract with another co-packing/production](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sponsorsone-increases-production-capacity-meet-130000746.html) company to increase production capacity by a factor of 4.0X.  
   
SPONF may be set up for a near term gain. Momentum from the two new product lines and the chart set up seem to indicate exactly that. **The timing here could provide a great swing opportunity for our group.**  
   
Stay tuned for our full report on SPONF recent developments to be issued later today.

159,2021-05-27,pennystocks,"So this one is both an investment of mine but also, as someone who strongly believes in psychedelics for medicine, this was the first time I ever heard of using psilocybin to treat major depression disorder in this way.  This is a really cool watch if this stuff interests you (12 min), and I'll do a short DD piece on the company below as well. 

&#x200B;

[The 12 minute corporate overview of the company goes over what theyre aiming to do, going over their executive team and their background, the scientific advisor board and what investors should expect by investing in $MYND:    https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IucbGuMnFZU&t ](https://preview.redd.it/drn11938mn171.png?width=1223&format=png&auto=webp&s=238d5f4c814c7211d1f88e62bf2ddbaa829e2217)

**The Company:**  


MYND Life Sciences is looking to use a single molecule of psilocybin (magic mushrooms) to target inflammation in a specific gene in our body. Their research over the last 8-10 years points towards inflammation being the root cause of depression. So instead of getting high on a trip and going to a clinic with trained professionals to treat depression (the more common way psychedelics are used as medicine), they're looking to create a non-psychoactive drug to take to market. This is what makes them unique imo.  


**The Exec Team:**

There's more and more psychedelic companies popping up over the last 2 years, so this is where you need to look to make sure its a real company and not just trying to jump on the hype. If you **go to the interview** the start going into detail on the executives and science advisory board members **at 5:23**. These guys put together a stellar team and their founder Dr. Jefferies has over 60 patents under his belt.   


**The Stock:**

So they just started trading on Wednesday on the CSE under $MYND. They've got \~53M shares outstanding and raised at $0.30 before going public. It was a really hot start to trading, and clearly people aren't willing to sell many shares given the L2 has almost no asks. Just keep in mind this is a LT play, and prices fluctuate quite a bit that first week or so of going public. So if the story grabs your attn, looking for a good entry point is important, while also realizing this is a biotech play so a quick flip probably isnt the MO. These are those ones you expect a longer term horizon but if they're successful with their numerous trials, they tap into a multi-billion dollar industry with a feel good product that has zero addiction to it.  


Ultimately, from all the psyche companies I put money into, this is one of the ones Im the most excited about because it hits home with some depression issues in family members Ive experienced over my life. So its got that added reason for why i put my money into them with a LT perspective hoping that these guys can help change the game for those suffering from MDD.",nm6gmp,[],1

Highlights from their website:

On a Trailing Four Quarter basis:
-TFQ Revenue was $7,244,647, an 87% increase over the previous TFQ period;

-Operating expenses for the TFQ ended March 31, 2021, were $4,389,751, a decrease of $1,026,854 or 19% compared to the same period in 2020;
-Non-IFRS Adjusted EBITDA for the TFQ was $(3,103,830) compared to $(3,673,380) for the previous TFQ. This 16% improvement resulted from higher revenue with improved margins of 27% compared to 22% for the comparative TFQ of 2020.

For the quarterly Q1 2021 results:
-Q1 quarterly revenues were $3,459,007, a 1,352 % increase over $238,171 for Q1 2020, which is directly attributed to revenue from two previously announced contracts with telecom infrastructure operators in Africa.
-Gross profit for Q1 was $751,163 or 22% compared to $77,134 for Q1 2020, a significant increase resulting from higher revenue for the quarter.

WAKEFIELD, MA – May 27, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) Innovation Pharmaceuticals (OTCQB:IPIX) (“the Company”), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, today announces that patient enrollment in the Company’s 120-patient, Phase 2 clinical trial of Brilacidin for COVID-19 has reached 90 percent and that the Company anticipates full enrollment to be completed in approximately two weeks.

Innovation Pharma is developing Brilacidin for treatment of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 in hospitalized patients under U.S. FDA Fast Track designation (see [NCT04784897](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04784897)). The Phase 2 study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating Brilacidin, a synthetic, non-peptidic small molecule drug candidate in a new class of compounds called defensin-mimetics, at domestic and international sites.

The Company intends to provide an update to shareholders upon the final patients entering the trial.

**About Brilacidin and COVID-19**

Brilacidin is the only non-peptidic defensin-mimetic drug candidate currently in a clinical trial as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. Additionally, Brilacidin has shown potent and consistent inhibition *in vitro* against coronaviruses, alphaviruses and bunyaviruses (with lab testing against other viruses also underway), supporting Brilacidin’s potential to be developed as a broad spectrum antiviral. The annual global antiviral drug market is [estimated](https://www.medgadget.com/2021/03/antiviral-drugs-market-2021-size-growth-share-trends-demand-merger-covid-19-impact-analysis-key-players-statistics-competitive-landscape-regional-outlook-and-global-industry-forecast-to-2.html) to reach $44 billion by 2026.

&#x200B;

**What have they achieved so far?**

&#x200B;

**5 IP of note undergoing testing or underway at this time.**

**Antiviral/Antibiotic/Antifungal ZENGuard ™:**

Has strong purported reliability against drug-resistant [disease](https://www.zengraphene.com/zen-graphene-solutions-announces-successful-testing-of-its-graphene-compound-against-antimicrobial-resistant-bacteria/). Functionality presents itself in the form of coatings for PPE in partnership with TreborRx of masks, mask filters and nitrile gloves. Phase 1 human trial testing of similar compound for pharmaceutical use case may begin sometime in the [fall](https://www.zengraphene.com/zen-graphene-solutions-announces-ingestion-good-laboratory-practice-study-for-its-graphene-based-compound/)**.** Through NucroTechnics they have confirmed that exposure of their compound does not lead to any irritation or [sensitivity](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/zen-graphene-solutions-announces-initial-phase-2-cytotoxicity-results-for-its). Minimum concentration < 1µg/ml to achieve 99.9% effectiveness. 

**Graphene-Enhanced Concrete:**

40% higher compressive and flexural strength at a 0.02% concentration of graphene, 84% at a 0.04% [concentration](https://www.zengraphene.com/graphene-derived-from-albany-graphite-continues-to-show-considerable-promise-as-cement-additive/).

**Graphene-Carbon Aerogel Batteries:**

Very exciting results through the German Aerospace Centre. 2 wt.% loading of graphene dispersed in aerogel and resulted in an initial specific discharge capacity of 2800 mAh/g and a discharge capacity of 1300 mAh/g after 50 cycles at a current [capacity of 186 mA/g](https://www.zengraphene.com/zen-graphene-solutions-announces-new-research-collaboration-agreement-on-carbon-aerogels-with-german-aerospace-center/). A [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1PKuHasAGI8z5SY7eH18ZN?si=c3cdbbf13a5c45bd)(Nov '19) with Francis Dube suggests further developments on this technology should see light within the next year (at the time it was suggested a 2 year minimum).

**Dehumidification Membranes:**

Through a partnership with Evercloak. Increases power efficiency of HVAC systems by [\~75%](https://www.zengraphene.com/royal-canadian-navy-partners-with-zen-graphene-and-evercloak-to-test-graphene-oxide-dehumidification-membrane-technology/).

**Corrosion Protection Coatings:**

Testing shows improved wear resistance, extend engine life, increase fuel efficiency, and increased engine power in vehicles. Epoxy corrosion-inhibiting coating for steel showed minimal corrosion (3% of surface) after 10 days when exposed to highly corrosive saline solution. Two-year project studying graphene as a corrosion protective [coating for steel](https://www.zengraphene.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-05-ZEN-Company-Presentation.pdf).

**Maths! Earnings!** Numbers provided on ZENS' Investor presentation, **I'm filling the gaps**.

Coating volume once ramped up (currently pilot stage) will be \~800million coated units per month \~2.4 billion per quarter. Earnings per unit provides **$0.03-$0.06** cents per unit giving **$2.19-$4.38 EPS** for 99,000,000 diluted shares with 24% corporate tax rate. This provides fair **2-3 year** **SP range of $30-$60** at full production capacity (upper end wont occur until we collapse our cost structure to enhance the unit margins).

Glove coatings at **$0.01-$0.04** per unit would add around **+$0.30-$1.20 EPS**, HVAC filters with coating at **$1.00-$4.00** per unit would provide **+$0.08-$0.30 EPS**. This adds onto the **max** 2-3 year SP range by **$5-$18 result in $35 - $70** on earnings from combined PPE & HVAC market penetration. We are currently expected to be at 32 million coatings per month by end of June. That is an annual rate of 384 million disregarding the ramping-up, providing **by June a floor EPS \~0.11 Justifying minimum of $4** if current extrinsic share price is allotted. November is when full production is expected. At least a full year or two will be required to prove earnings, stabilizing intrinsic share price.

A similar material to ZENGuard**™** is being tested toward [therapeutic usage](https://www.zengraphene.com/zen-graphene-solutions-announces-ingestion-good-laboratory-practice-study-for-its-graphene-based-compound/) within the human body. Therapeutic would disrupt portions of a massive industry so it's hard to take into account. We will see resistance from this sector, so do not expect this to happen quietly or easily. Controversy is likely if this portion is a success. This is where the true speculative value of ZGS will be. If they can pull off ZENGuard™ they can redouble toward therapeutic and disrupt sectors of pharmaceuticals that have poor adaptability.

It kills superbugs, partially solving a present and future problem. Bacteria/viruses/fungi can't really adapt out of silver. It destroys the cells by lysis, so, if adopted, we may not see the problem we've seen caused by the overuse of antibiotics. Human/animal cells have more and thicker membranes, protecting them from lytic destruction. DNA I'm not too sure the effects toward, but should be minimal if any. Testing will confirm and is ongoing.

**Great!.. What are we waiting for?**

A [health advisory](https://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2021/75309a-eng.php) published April 2nd by Health Canada brought to light a series of unwarranted masks which were introduced into the markets late last spring, as to take advantage of the Covid-19 virus without safety testing or certification. These masks allegedly contained Graphene, causing a obvious holdup for our graphene-based coating for masks. Further info has been sent to HC and secondary testing is now underway & awaiting results.

https://preview.redd.it/6ie985rawo171.png?width=1421&format=png&auto=webp&s=e37de145b651a9e27f7d92e01ca4bf4b9270d7c8

Bantrel, an engineering firm, is working with ZEN to establish a pipeline for producing ZENGuard coating material, while configurable for other use. ZEN remains on course to produce \~32 million by June approximately.

The major problem thus far with graphene markets, isn't about creating the tech, it has been about showing and exposing people to how effective small amounts of graphene are in improving already existing products. It's been shown that Graphene is a great additive for many applications, and provides [**large efficiency bonuses**](https://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-05/uom-ips051821.php) **from small % addition**, but many IP needs introduction to market or to create the markets. ZEN has done very well with getting reach arounds from companies; Board has alluded to other PPE + Filtration manufacturers expressing interest so keep posted. TreborRx has an **LOI** agreement to collaborate on a minimum 100,000,000 masks so it is not an expressly permanent agreement by any means.

They are sitting on $4mil cash from previous offering. Cash burn of \~1.5mil per quarter while setting up production infrastructure. Either **expect success out of ZENGuard™** or **be ready for a little more dilution/warrants**.

**Closing Statements & Comments:**

Some may be worried ZENGuard ™ is only a good product for corona but this is a product with no competition, it is an application to already existing products. Better PPE would only benefit everyone in the future IMO, plus that isn't its only application given it is a coating.

This could be the beginning of something great, don't get too caught up in day-day movements, this could easily take months to move significantly so if you don't have patience this company might not be the right pick. Much news to come! Patience is key if you know what's coming.

Thank you for your time when reading and taking this innovative company into consideration. Evercloak and TreborRx, the partners of ZEN will provide great stories for scientific progress through future as well.

a bit more about Predictor

“Prediction Tournaments.” Prediction Tournaments are contests that have a collection of predictions tied to one event. Some other updates:

* **Prediction Tournaments don’t require Coins.** At the beginning of a Tournament, every predictor will start with 1,000 “Tokens” to play with; these are different from Coins, and are not purchasable. You can only use the Tokens you’re given, or that you earn during tournament play. So make those predictions count!
* **Mods can create Tournaments.** Mods can create the Predictions, name the Tournaments, select the correct answers and end the Tournaments. (So basically, they can run tournaments without help from a Reddit admin.) Mods can also host as many Tournaments as they’d like, but there can only be one live Tournament in a community at a time.
* **Each Tournament has its own leaderboard.** Each community will have its own Tournament leaderboard, and when that Tournament ends your place will be preserved in Tournament history. If a community starts another Tournament, you can start fresh and earn your way to first place in a brand-new leaderboard! (Leaderboards will live in a dedicated “Predictions” tab in the community.)

Older but still great info...


GNUS stock primarily benefits from what the underlying company calls “content with a purpose.” What this translates to is “edutainment,” or entertaining children with cartoon characters while teaching them valuable life lessons.

Here, Genius Brands does offer an intriguing narrative. It levers the intellectual property of Stan Lee outside of his Marvel Comics universe. As well, notable celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger lends his voice and support for Genius content.

Even more bullish for GNUS stock, the novel coronavirus pandemic essentially gave the underlying company a hostage audience. As you might expect, screen time for kids increased dramatically. With so many parents worried about their young ones being influenced by the wrong content, Genius Brands offers an extremely compelling solution.",nmcm5l,[],1

a bit more about Predictor

“Prediction Tournaments.” Prediction Tournaments are contests that have a collection of predictions tied to one event. Some other updates:

* **Prediction Tournaments don’t require Coins.** At the beginning of a Tournament, every predictor will start with 1,000 “Tokens” to play with; these are different from Coins, and are not purchasable. You can only use the Tokens you’re given, or that you earn during tournament play. So make those predictions count!
* **Mods can create Tournaments.** Mods can create the Predictions, name the Tournaments, select the correct answers and end the Tournaments. (So basically, they can run tournaments without help from a Reddit admin.) Mods can also host as many Tournaments as they’d like, but there can only be one live Tournament in a community at a time.
* **Each Tournament has its own leaderboard.** Each community will have its own Tournament leaderboard, and when that Tournament ends your place will be preserved in Tournament history. If a community starts another Tournament, you can start fresh and earn your way to first place in a brand-new leaderboard! (Leaderboards will live in a dedicated “Predictions” tab in the community.)

They have been rated as overweight and mostly strong buy or buy.

From a research POV, I would be surprised to see any huge news soon. I am looking in the year timeframe.",nmdb59,[],1

716,2021-05-27,pennystocks,"$CYP announced an update on the pilot plant. Everything is on schedule. The plant is expected to be fully operational in July 2021.

As part of the work, a direct lithium extraction (""DLE"") technology from Chemionex is also being tested. Cypress is seeking to secure an option to license Chemionex's proprietary Lionex DLE technology for commercial use at its Clayton Valley lithium project.

The plant at the Amargosa Valley site will be divided into three main sections. 

The initial focus of the pilot plant operation will be on chloride-based leaching to confirm previously reported results. 

In the leach area, work will be done to optimise leach conditions and confirm lithium extraction in the enriched leach solution. 

In the in the tailings handling section, different variants will be tested through to determine material processing, moisture content and water consumption.

The work carried out by NORAM Engineering will treat the concentrated lithium solution from the DLE area of the pilot plant to produce lithium hydroxide and test the separated leach solution for compatibility when returned to the leach area of the plant.

In most cases such market circumstances should have a significant bullish effect of $CYP. The deal will be finalized not later then 7th of June and this news will be the biggest shift in the price of $CYP in recent years in my opinion.",nmdhvx,[],0
723,2021-05-27,pennystocks,"Lets start a thread where we can all post some of the Low Float (less than 100M shares in the public float) Gems we're looking at or currently holding with the DD on them. 

With all of the nonsense and garbage in the OTC these days (especially on Twitter with the FinTwit pumpers...you know who they are) Reddit seems to be the only place to get good information about companies with solid foundations, business plans, and low floats. It seems the FinTwit community would rather invest in something at 0.001 with tens of billions of shares in the structure than in something that is already at 0.05 with low float, catalysts, and actual business operations.

Personally, I am holding the following low floats at the moment and here's why:

\- AXTG - Pink Current - Reverse Merger in play with William Tien appointed as the new CEO. Tien is the founder of TiENPAY, a cryptocurrency and blockchain payment system and is a big name in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia with a vision of bringing his technology to North America. 20M in the float, sitting in and around 0.04. Here is the latest PR: [https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/AXTG/news/Axis-Technologies-Group-Inc-Announces-Pink-Current-Information-Status-With-OTC-Markets-Appointment-of-New-Management-Tea?id=304748](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/AXTG/news/Axis-Technologies-Group-Inc-Announces-Pink-Current-Information-Status-With-OTC-Markets-Appointment-of-New-Management-Tea?id=304748)

\- GEVI - Pink in process - This one is a bit speculative. They are an entertainment venture who is working on new management with the bringing on of a ""grammy award winning artist"" (not released yet) and their record label which currently houses 12 other acts. Latest PR also speaks to the development of NFTs for the artist and label. 7-11M in the float, sitting around 0.18. Here is the latest PR: [https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/GEVI/news/story?e&id=1905980](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/GEVI/news/story?e&id=1905980)
