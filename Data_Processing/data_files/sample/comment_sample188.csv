56,gznjnif,2021-05-27,t1_gzn35r0,stocks,"These are great questions! 

I see a huge emphasis being put on energy storage. There are countries that are regularly exceeding their energy demand using renewables but as soon as the sun sets or the wind dies down, they need to ramp up fossil fuel plants again. I see utilities and electrical producers investing heavily in infrastructure to store massive amounts of energy. This could be done through a variety of physical and   
 chemical methods. Additionally, we should expect to see energy prices increase as utilities and energy companies have to start sequestering carbon. My background is in atmospheric chemistry so I've been a lot more amped on the chemical energy storage but physical storage will likely scale better. 

&#x200B;

I have a lot of thoughts about hydrogen. Long story short, it needs a lot more work. On paper, hydrogen fuel cells look game changing but the real world applications are a little trickier. Infrastructure issues behind mass deployment of hydrogen is an issue (see: The Hindenberg) as well as long term durability of fuel cells. Additionally, the most efficient way to get H2 gas is to ""crack"" methane (CH4) or other hydrocarbons. This means there will still be a demand for natural gas extraction (which is very detrimental to our climate and local air quality) in order to power our hydrogen fuel cells. I really, really want to believe in hydrogen but I don't see it beating electric and alternative fueled vehicles in the next decade. Those two sectors have their own set of hurdles to surmount but it'll be a lot easier than hydrogen.

&#x200B;

The two aspects of renewable energy that have gotten me really excited recently are biochemical production of natural gas (e.g. renewable natural gas) and plasma gasification. Using microbes to produce natural gas not only gives us useable natural gas to power infrastructure but it also serves as a method of carbon sequestration. Plasma gasification is using plasma to heat materials so that they release all combustible gases and produce solid carbon and trace metals (which can be disposed of).

But investing per 100$ increments is more work than its worth. If i were you id keep money in my bank account until i have 2-3 month worth of emergency fund. Once you have achieved that, then start putting money into investing. Everytime you hit around 1000-2000$ then invest (Buy stocks, ETF, whatever). I always try to invest in brackets between 1000$ and 2000$. When a really good deal shows up (lets say a -5% in the SPY) then ill spend my invest money even if its 1000 or lower).   


And the reason why I ''force'' myself to invest once it reaches 2000 is that if you wait to long for a deal/dip, then you might miss the boat. This strategy has been doing well for me.  


TLDR:  
1. Always have a buffer for emergency that you aren't putting in the market.   
2. Buy within a min/max bracket so that you can more reactively take advantage of dips, while also making sure you don't waste to much time waiting for dips that might not occur.",[],0

Investing in a broad index ETF such as SPY guarantees you are the owner of every company that goes bankrupt.  Buying a bunch of companies will probably result in some 10, 20, 30-bagggers. You will also have some losers, but you can off-set those with gains in taxable accounts.  
The maximum you can lose on a $1,000 investment is $1,000 but the maximum you can gain is technically infinity. More realistically, up to 10-20x -- which means you would need 10-20 other stocks to go banko just to break even (and it's not too likely anybody will have that many companies go to $0). 
Back in the .com boom, anybody that bought a bunch of tech companies would've had some bankruptcies like Etoys, Pets.com, etc. But they would've also had insane gains in Amazon, Apple, Priceline, etc -- especially if they're in it for the long term. Based on that experience, I'm taking the same approach to EV stocks and it had turned out very well for me. And with a taxable account, a 100% loss on a stock is more like a 70-75% loss, as you can net that loss against your other gains, which means you'll be writing Uncle Sam a smaller check because of your losses.
I don't think there is anything as too many stocks; over the course of many years, having a vested interest in many companies will allow you to see the 'personalities' of the stocks over time, which will allow you to gain trust in certain ones. Sure, you can do your DD prior to making an investment, but seeing 1st hand how some weather business cycles, recessions, pandemics, etc. will build your trust in management over time. You may need to wait years for another good entry point but when you get it, you can confidently jump in with both feet and make some huge gains.  
TL;DR - IMO, at least keep a passive eye on your positions and no amount is too many.",['AAPL'],0

471,gzo48pt,2021-05-27,t1_gzndzlz,stocks,"platform-wise, yes there is definitely some growing to do for CBS and they joined the game waaay too late. Amazon has rights to NFL's thursday night football currently, but they were not actively seeking a partnership with the NFL. the way i saw this deal, the NFL set a price point that regular tv networks deemed too high purposely because they knew Amazon has the capital and wants to get their skin in the game or test the waters at least in addition to their marketing power.

one of the few leverages the traditional TV networks have are local team broadcasts. their infrastructure is already in place for this. this is where a lot of other streaming services lack. all the major sports networks that big streamers usually carry (NFL TV, NBA TV, MLB TV) blackout local games. while things like the super bowl are important to viewership, that is just icing on the cake to me. local viewership is just as important, especially when generational talent rolls around, for that consistent income. athletes nowadays are human billboards. coupled with talks that college athletes will be able to be paid/endorsed heating up. Patrick Mahomes, the next football prodigy in many people's eyes, has singlehandedly increased viewership/interest by leaps and bounds. traditional tv networks are able to show these guys more regularly with local viewership + just being able to show more national games in general rather than the once a week 1 match up thursday night football. CBS in particular also has a long list of sportscasters that have been around for decades and they can sway viewership also, albeit on a much smaller scale. your average sports fan is going to pick the service where we can see our teams more often rather than just the ""big games"". these people are loyal and will go where ever their team goes. 

this is territory where it gets tricky for big streamers because of the (for lack of a better term) ""cyclical"" nature of sports, both season and draw appeal of the athletes. unless big streamers acquired a traditional tv network or became a network themselves, they would likely have to work something out with their competitors. it'd be too much of a risk to ride only on the big games because the outcome of a sporting event can tank viewership/ratings in the blink of an eye as what it was with the most recent super bowl. i wouldn't put it passed a company like amazon to do this with the way they've been going, but it seems like a hill that may be too difficult to climb.",[],1

We can do that fine with a quantum safe algo, of which, there are plenty and a quantum computer will absolutely suck at those for a long time.

Quantum computing has potential, that is true. But the number of application is overblown. It will be critical to some applications, but useless for most. Its like all the idiots who actually thing blockchain is new and magical. It isn't. Quantum will be able to solve things that numerically werent possible before due to data size. But not everything needs that much data solved simultaneously. In fact, very few things need that though those few can be very interesting.

One thing that might come from quantum is the ability to communicate over huge distances at, possibly, speeds faster than light. Think internet without any distance latency. This would open up the possibility of deep space travel. Basically you can watch the latest flicks (porn) from billions of miles away...

Another might be muti dimensional data storage. In theory, if we can stabilize a quantum state for data storage, a quantum storage device can have storage density unlike anything we have now. It would be revolutionary. Think of a box where you can store a message inside. It can be empty or it can have a letter. Now think instead of putting the letter inside, what if you pin the letter to the outsides of the box on one of the 6 surfaces? Since it has 6 sides, you can potentially store 6 messages on the surfaces and all you need to do is say which side of the box to look at to find your letter. Its the same box, but instead of 1 letter you now have 6. Quantum would be able to have a lot more than 6 sides. It will just depend on how well we can devise a way to read it.",[],0

Its latest results I thought were pretty robust considering it had to deal with Covid / reduced demand, Texan weather and not great commodity prices. These are a pretty rare mix of events that is going to cause a strain, and yet they weathered well.

They are an extremely well diversified mid-stream company. They have many more miles of gas than oil, have 10s of thousands of miles in total, significant storage, multiple refining locations and also ports. 

&#x200B;

It is now increasingly hard to build even a single pipeline, can you imagine trying to get sign-off for 50000 miles of pipeline? Political winds have given large pipeline companies a significant barrier to entry and competition. 

&#x200B;

Although it's easy to say that political winds and social pressures are moving away from fossil fuels, I'd make a couple of rebuttals. Firstly, not all fossil fuels are equal, going from coal > oil > gas, in that order. Coal exists and is being actively phased out by most of the Western world,, but oil and gas still have decades to run. The data I've seen suggests that although oil falls as a % of total energy by 2050, due to demand from developing world, actually increases in barrels. A lot of people don't realise but less than half of oil goes toward vehicles, and you would be astonished to know what it's used in. Gas will have an even longer shelf-life as the cleanest of the fossil fuels. 

&#x200B;

For me, as a Brit, the fact its an MLP is actually a benefit. Usually I get charged a 15% withholding tax on my American dividends, but as MLPs pay distributions, I am not charged for this. My brokerage takes care of the K-1 paperwork that I understand is a bit of a hassle, but I never see it. A near 8% yield on an American stock is extremely rare, and only my UK miners exceed that (helped as I also get no divi tax on them either as I keep it in an ISA, similar but much better than your IRAs)

2. Gold prices have already increased in anticipation of inflation. Gold prices are already up about 20% since the start of the pandemic. Much of the returns from precious metals are driven by changing investor sentiment rather than tracking inflation. Declining interest rates cause inflation fears, which drive up prices before inflation even happens. By the time inflation happens and rates go up, gold prices decline. Just look at what happened to gold/silver prices after the GFC.

The sunroof in the F250 has been replaced twice now.

The fuel tank bits came screwed up and caused the gas gauge to read incorrectly.

The replaced fuel tank pumps would later go on to fail.  Causing my dealer to keep the truck for over a month.  Thank god for the extended warranty which covered a rental vehicle during that time (even though this occurred under the factory warranty).

I did score a 40k extended service policy out of the deal.  Which covers all consumables - except fuel.  So that's pretty cool.

If you left the key fob in your pocket and you hit it wrong, the tailgate would deploy at high way speeds.  The first time that happened, it was mildly amusing and all James Bondy-ie.  Not so much afterwards.  Thankfully a quick fix there with a firmware update.

Aside from that, it at least hasn't left me stranded.  It was able to limp home with the failed fuel pumps.

My F150 - while old, doesn't have that many miles on it.  About 138k.

Many many years ago, it had relays fail that stranded me.  The intake manifold had to be replaced twice (in very, very short order).  The a/c failed - (admittedly, this one I blame this on just sheer age) in an ugly ugly way that caused the whole system to have to be replaced.
