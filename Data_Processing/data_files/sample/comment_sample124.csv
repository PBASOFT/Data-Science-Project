The main thing for me is my good performers are doing fine but all my red stocks are down like 30-45% (weed stocks) so I'm waiting for the things (that will crash eventually) to try and catch them on the way back up before they peak and crash again.

Massive understatment. The community will never be what it was before. There is a mammoth sized amount of content to sift through that is absolute garbage posted by the second and unsurprisingly devolved the communities financial literacy from the low bar it already was. 

Now it's shorts this, hedgies that, just buzzwords fueled greatly by social bullshit and get rich quick pumps. With a whole global market out there, you just can't escape those people anymore on the sub.  We don't hate hedge funds or shorts, they were üåàüêª standing in way of the magnificent bull run.

An exchange-traded fund that offers investors exposure to meme assets, and all the trending investments that social media has to offer, is making its debut on Wall Street.

Tuttle Capital Management‚Äôs FOMO ETF (FOMO -0.36%) will start trading on the Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE -0.27%) on Tuesday, providing the market with a new tool for leveraging the retail trading boom by investing in all the buzziest ‚Äúmeme stocks‚Äù and funds, from special-purpose acquisition corporations‚Äîknown by the acronym SPACs‚Äîto crypto-adjacent investments.

The fund‚Äôs ticker symbol is based on the popular acronym for ‚ÄúFear of missing out,‚Äù a widely shared sentiment on social media sites like Reddit, Twitter and Discord, where users live in fear of missing out on the latest trending investments, which could be in the midst of a parabolic move higher.

‚ÄúFOMO can shift exposure to whatever happens to be trending at the time,‚Äù Matthew Tuttle, the fund‚Äôs creator and Tuttle Capital CEO, said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt rebalances weekly so it can stay in harmony with market trends, and it weights holdings appropriately.‚Äù

The sudden rise and obvious power of the retail trading movement has created a new market dynamic with social-media activity now being used by some as a predictive tool for the movement of equities and other assets, most famously in popular stocks like GameStop (GME +16.34%) and AMC Entertainment (AMC +19.96%) which have come to exemplify the wild volatility of the retail investing scene.

Crypto have also grabbed the attention of individual investors as have some SPACs, the most notable being a large following for Bill Ackman‚Äôs Pershing Square Tontine Holdings (PSTH -1.43%). FOMO will offer crypto exposure by purchasing shares in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -4.85%), among other investments that are pegged to crypto.

‚ÄúThe Covid lockdowns have energized the retail investor to look beyond traditional market-cap weighted index investments into the thematic space,‚Äù Tuttle said.

Of course, Tuttle‚Äôs ETF isn‚Äôt the only fund attempting to capitalize on Reddit-inspired investors. Back in March, VanEck launched the VanEck Vectors Social Sentiment ETF (BUZZ +0.55%), which said it would offer exposure to stocks with ‚Äúthe most bullish investor sentiment and perception.‚Äù 

Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports, is a shareholder in the company that created the index that underlies the VanEck fund.

Returns for BUZZ, referring to the ticker symbol for the VanEck social-sentiment ETF, have been less-than impressive. It is up 1.74% since its debut in March, compared against returns of at least 11% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA -0.24%) and the S&P 500 index (SPX -0.21%) and a gain of more than 7% for the Nasdaq Composite Index (COMP -0.03%).

FOMO‚Äôs expense ratio is 0.9%, which means its will cost an investor $9 in annual fees for every $1,000 invested. BUZZ‚Äôs expense ratio is 0.75%.",['GME'],0

1359,gzfz06d,2021-05-25,t1_gzfmgiv,wallstreetbets,"1) the ""due diligence"" is a bunch of conspiracy theories, which makes both these companies uninteresting to touch as the main holders are unsophisticated investors who act irrationally. Both companies are massively overvalued at the current price and a pull back will happen, just how much volatility there will be before then is impossible to predict. I know this is a gambling sub, but I'll only gamble in the stock market in a position where I feel I'm most likely to win, otherwise I'd do it on sports that is a bit more entertaining than watching a line go up or down.

2) holders are obnoxious and do not understand that when you say something bad about a company, it doesn't mean you want to short it. Holders are mega defensive on everything and think there's an active campaign to suppress their stocks when they're by far the most mentioned on this sub. 

3) holders of these companies complain that the sub has gone to shit, and yet are still happy to spam their ticker here for no reason, while also claiming to be long term shareholders. If you're in it for the long run, why the fuck do you care what anyone here thinks? What do you have to gain from posting here? If this sub is ""compromised"", why the fuck do I still see your idiotic comment?

4) massive entitlement, thinking that they made this sub great as subscriber count has grown 100x over the last couple years, when in fact their addition has completely deteriorated the quality of the discussions on this sub. But mods can't ban these discussions as it's a slippery slope to over moderation.

You want to make this sub better? Post about gme / amc in the dedicated subs and come here to discover other plays. Everyone here already knows amc / gme and have already taken up their positions on these stocks.",[],0

It wasn't obvious. It has been ""about to pump"" for months. I imagine you would've gone all in in options and up until last week basically anything you purchased likely would've expired worthless if you're speaking to buying OTM calls.

> I‚Äôd never get fucked ever and I‚Äôd be the one fucking.

One big win won't insulate you from getting fucked again. That's the mentality of a person who invites others to fuck them.

> I wish I had it all in GME, would‚Äôve came out the smartest investor of 2021

GME was a bad trade until it wasn't, like anything else. Even DFV couldn't have predicted this-- he bought a stock that was undervalued and near it's all time low, basically finding a stock that only had the potential to go up. The ensuing theatrics with GME were just happenstance, luck. Plenty of boomers have plenty of shares in GME for decades. 

> I have 0 positions in the memes. And I kept doubting them and now I‚Äôm getting fucked left and right.

You're not getting fucked. No one is fucking you. You're just not buying into memes. That's it. If you want to risk it, do it. If you can't stomach the returns while also being unable to stomach the FOMO, then you're in the wrong fuckin place.

All this GME price action over the last year has just been on the ***announcement***  that Ryan Cohen is involved.

A decreasing world population with increased purchasing power doesn‚Äôt change market saturation conditions. If there are less people, they will buy less of certain things. You CAN have too much stuff and while planned obsolescence has delayed some of that, push it too far and you forever lose a customer in the absence of monopolies.

The ONLY real solution would be to cut production and limit the product on the market. The side effect of doing that is you fire people. This leads to a deflationary spiral because if more people lose purchasing power, there‚Äôs even less money chasing product which deflates even more.

So simply put, I don‚Äôt think your thesis will hold up to depopulation. And modernization has actually led to less being needed anyways, with tech adding utility and making clutter more unnecessary.

Deflation is coming.",['AI'],0

Type ‚ÄúW-8‚Äù and a drop down should appear with ‚ÄúW-8 Form‚Äù (chose this request if you wish to update your W8BEN for tax status on your international trading account) 

Then that should give you another drop down asking ‚ÄúWhich account account does this apply to?‚Äù  

Select the relevant a count (ensure that the account selected is your international account)

This should take you to the next step 1 of 3‚Ä¶ press continue

Be aware that shit will turn you into a bagholder. It will set an unreasonable price anchor in your head that will make you make bad choices and not get out when you should.

Take it from someone who missed out on $100,000+ GME gains because I got it into my head that ""$1000 is not a meme"" -- maybe it's not...but if you've got options that expire, it sure as shit is. 

DTE is *meaningless* when the top will be fleeting. And there will be a top. 

Nobody knows what it will be, but trust me, the feeling of missing out on some extra gains because you sold ""too early"" is **WAY WAY** less terrible than bagholding and watching 80%+ of your gains evaporate when the rug gets pulled. It will haunt you forever.

Stairs up, elevator down...it's not going to just fizzle out slowly. People saying ""wait for the top and sell on the way down"" are either idiots or want you to hold their bags.

If you're like me and get caught in it, you still won't sell even if it does recover some after crashing. You'll get anchored on what you ""had"" and feel like it's owed to you, so you'll keep waiting for it to go back up, but you'll just keep leaving more on the table as it keeps draining away.

The top can't be called...so the best advice I can offer is to have a tiered exit strategy, set some limit orders all along the way up and just walk away.

Then new Mods were put in, and they hammered on all of the guidelines, enforced extensively and unnecessarily in some cases and lots of ban crazy episodes.

She set up the account put all her info in and we honestly thought we owned the stocks until they told us the routing number was incorrect, but they would buy the stocks regardless in ‚Äúgood faith‚Äù 

I came to the conclusion going halfsies on stocks was a terrible idea. 

I know I should‚Äôve investigated it for myself - but I trusted the person calling customer support all day while I was at work. We never got a definitive answer what would happen - it‚Äôs almost like they didn‚Äôt know either.  

After hearing the nightly AMC report for the third night in a row I decided to call it a day. Either buy and sell the stocks or forget about it...I just didn‚Äôt do enough research to realize it would affect her credit or be hounded by fidelity for 1k.

But to answer your point, cargo cults were borne out of allied occupation of small pacific islands during the Second World War. The indigenous peoples, particularly of Micronesia and Papua New Guinea, previously had only infrequent contact with the outside world. Now they had large groups of of people from a society that was (technologically speaking) thousands of years ahead of them and sharing wealth (referred to by them as ""cargo"") which seemed mundane to the GIs but was incomprehensibly luxurious to the islanders. 

After the war ended the GIs went home and the peoples of these islands were effectively left to fend for themselves. But the collective memory of the foreigners who showed up and showered them with riches beyond their wildest fantasies remained. They didn't *really* understand the broader context of what had happened, but they knew what they had seen.

So a new religion emerged. They fashioned ""uniforms"" from cast off clothing. Maintained abandoned airstrips, going so far as to make ""headsets"" out of coconut shells so they could sit in the control towers and direct imaginary air traffic. They marched and paraded around as they had seen the soldiers do. Why? Because although they didn't know what these actions and objects *meant* they knew they were associated with that the cultists *truly* wanted - for the GIs to return and bring all the cargo back with them.

They even have a name to their erstwhile hero: ""John Frum"". It's unlikely that Frum was ever a real person, although several islands claim to be in possession of his grave. It's possible that the name stems from a misinterpretation of a random GI attempting to introduce himself (Hi, I'm John from Cincinnati). Cargo cultists believe that if they perform the right actions with the right ceremonial accouterments then John Frum will return and with him he will bring rewards for his followers in the form of cargo (or, wealth).

Over time the rituals they performed and their expectations of the reward they would receive grew and became increasingly outlandish. Modern cargo cultists can be seen wearing truly impressive ""uniforms"" and engaging in incredibly intricate drills/exercises as nothing has, to date, caused Frum to arrive with the sought after wealth. 

This is the memestonk cultists to a T. They idolize DFV in the same way Frum is venerated. They obsessively do things they don't truly understand in the hopes that it will cause them to be rewarded with an unrealistic prize -with the added bonus that they hope to see their ""enemies"" destroyed when the end-times come. 

u/GasolinePizza is correct that they *also* exhibit many (if not all) of the indicators of a classical cult,  including hostility to non-members, discouraging critical thinking about their belief system, and a gradual subsumation of their individual identities. But I'm already going to trigger Chad Dickens so I'll let him explain that one to you. ^(and sorry to everyone else for cluttering your feed)",[],0

Rothschilds bow to Bogdanoffs.
In contact with aliens.
Possess psychic-like abilities.
Control France with an iron but fair fist.
Own castles & banks globally.
Will bankroll the first cities on Mars (Bogdangrad will be be the first city).
Direct descendants of the ancient royal blood lines.
Can save entire continents with a single phone call.
Own 99% of DNA editing research facilities on Earth.
First designer babies will in all likelihood be Bogdanoff babies.
Both brothers said to have 215+ IQ, such intelligence on Earth has only existed deep in Tibetan monasteries & Area 51.
Ancient Indian scriptures tell of two angels who will descend upon Earth and will bring an era of enlightenment and unprecedented technological progress with them.
The Tunguska event in 1908 was actually the Bogdanoff's arriving on planet Earth. How else do you think they got their Slavic last names and how else do you explain the exponential acceleration in technological and scientific development since then?
They own Nanobot R&D labs around the world.
You likely have Bogdabots inside you right now.
The Bogdanoffs are in regular communication with the Archangels Michael and Gabriel, forwarding the word of God to the Orthodox Church. Who do you think set up the meeting between the pope & the Orthodox high command (First meeting between the two organisations in over 1000 years) and arranged the Orthodox leader‚Äôs first trip to Antarctica in history literally a few days later to the Bogdanoff bunker in Wilkes land?
They learned fluent French in under a week.
Invented post-anabelian froeboid geometrics, a complex field of mathematics which only they can comprehend fully.
Nation states entrust their gold reserves with the twins. There‚Äôs no gold in Ft. Knox, only Ft. Bogdanoff.
All major philosophers and scientists have made reference to them in one way or another.
The twins are about 7 decades old, from the space-time reference point of the base human currently accepted by our society.

Mods are not deleted, they got removed and readded because reddit does not give us functionality to move admins around. **This has been said many, many times.**

The only threads that get stickied are megathreads, weekly earnings, rules threads, and the occasional joke thread.

>  I remember one of the new mods 'wsbincinerator' who was then removed quickly

Literally just someone's alt. According to the modlog they had no mod actions. Your point?

> This sub gained 8mil + members and the only content that get 10k+ likes is GME related.

Because all the people that came over, came over because of GME. I know. Mindblowing.

Also, meaningful discussion will ALWAYS get lower engagement than funny memes or confirmation bias. That's how social media works.

> I'm not necessarily saying you have been bought off or that you're on anyones side, just seems something has happened, i don't know what.

Yes. 8 million people joined reddit and started acting like it was facebook. 

>  I just want my GME megathread 

The GME megathread causes silos and only made the division between GME diehards and GME haters. The subreddit normally goes through swings as it trades whatever is moving the most, but by separating people, many people never got to see what the subreddit actually is.",['GME'],1

JPOW looks deep into SPYs eyes. The energy around him shifts from a calming familiar friend to that of a sinister deviant.
