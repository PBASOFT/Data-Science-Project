The men would accept the arrangement because if they accepted, THEY TOO would be allowed to fuck little kids.

It's why Muslims can consume kosher meat and vice versa.

This is a form of tax, a regessive one that hits lower income earners harder than higher earners..ie. a person making 45k a year drives 20 mi to work, the same distance as someone making 200k. They both pay the same price for gas, yet the 45k a year driver pays a higher percentage of their income for gas. Inflation is brutal and is rearing its ugly head. 30 year mortage in 1981 was 16.5%.

The men would accept the arrangement because if they accepted, THEY TOO would be allowed to fuck little kids.

Retards.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end trading with some of the dumbest, most mentally crippling strategies. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little reddit karma for saying we did.

We'll punish our accounts doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time on hold with Robinhood support all to avoid a single extra cent per trade.

Many of us have lost careers from doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same options over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know every little detail such that some have attained such trader nirvana that they can literally lose money blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many accounts have been wiped, margins called, families and marriages destroyed in retardation? All to later be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They short our stocks? We're already raising the price without them. They take our brokers? Traders aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even founding brokerages our selves. They think calling us broke, poor, delusional is going to change us? We've been called worse things by our fellow retards with trading accounts in the negatives. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to losing money. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challenge when they tell us the squeeze has been squoze. Our obsession with proving we can still lose money after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big banks and brokerages laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed retardflex.

Traders are retarded, hard core, by nature. We love a challenge. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challenge us. You're not $TSLA, you're not $LULU, you're not $MU; this is just another meme stock.",[],0

You attend meetings in some dude's basement that you're pretty sure is used for either ritual sacrifices or weird sex shit based on how it's dimly lit by candles and the iron handcuffs hanging from the ceilings. You roll your eyes every time the guy in the blood red cloak and hood talks about the rewards you'll receive in the afterlife if you just pledge your loyalty and donate your wealth to the cult. Your friends and family all make fun of you and call you a dumbass. 

A couple months later, you don't know how things got so out of hand but you're being pressured by the entire cult to drink the cyanide-laced Kool-Aid with them so you can all ascend to the promised land. You decide fuck it, you already lost your life savings in OTM FD's and the rest went to the cult so you could keep banging the same chick, who's been passed around multiple other members, and you've been pretty depressed so what do you have to lose? You chug down your portion out of a plastic Chuck-e-Cheese mug and then die in agony.

Pitch black nothingness. All of a sudden you feel warm sunshine on your face and smell a fresh ocean breeze mixed with the scent of mom's cinnamon buns. You open your eyes and wake up in the muscular arms of the god Thor. He whispers into your ears, ""It was all true, welcome to Valhalla."" He leads you to your yacht where you find 100 big bosomed women, every single one the most gorgeous you've ever seen, and all desperate to snort your unlimited supply of cocaine off your massive 12"" penis (you were only 3"" before). And this is exactly what it feels like to own shares of GME.",['GME'],1

The church just announced 20 new temples FFS! Where are the 20 new homeless shelters? Where are the funds going that will actually help people who need it NOW as opposed to ""helping"" dead people, which is all that temples are used for? Did Jesus tell the sick and needy to come to him for help, or was it only the worthy, 10 percent tithe payers? The fact that you DON'T see an issue with this tells me everything I need to know about your character: ""The church will never be wrong and no matter what they do you'll find a way to support it.""

And you are seriously defending people having to pay money out of their own pockets to ""serve"" a mission for this church worth $100 billion? Where missionaries don't even get to choose where to go, who their companions are, etc? A church that sends young men and women out to preach the gospel without teaching them the full history of the chruch? I was on my mission when I learned Joseph Smith had 40+ wives, that he used to be a treasure hunter before he founded the church, that he translated the book of mormon using a rock in a hat, that he had 4 different accounts of the first vision, etc etc etc etc. Imagine my shock when that turned out to be 100 percent true, and I never knew any of it after being a lifelong member! You don't see ANY problem with this, at all? A church that hides or misrepresents its true history is most ASSUREDLY the Lord's church, alright ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)

| ""And tithing isn’t a threat. It’s an “if then” statement. If you don’t want to pay tithing that’s fine, but you can’t claim what only comes to people who do. To act like you can dictate to deity how he should act is simply narcissistic.""  


You literally CANNOT go to the temple if you aren't a full-tithe payer. Which means you CANNOT participate in the saving ordinances that allow you to go to the celestial kingdom and be with your family for eternity. And you dare to claim that tithing ISN'T a threat? HOW?!?!? Please use common sense and tell me how that's not a threat. It's as simple as this:

  
A) Pay tithing and you can go to the temple

OR

B) Don't pay tithing, and you are not worthy to go to the temple, and therefore cannot participate in the saving ordinances.

That is 100% a threat, they are holding your salvation hostage for 10% of your income. There is no amount of mental gymnastics you can perform to change that fact. And you still defend this practice, because you've been taught that the church can do no wrong, that the leaders are always correct, and that you cannot criticize your leaders. I'll do it for you: THIS CHURCH IS AN ABOMINATON AND A BLIGHT ON THE WORLD. If Jesus was real, he would smite this organization to the ground and burn it for eternity. No organization that claims to speak as the one true church of the lord would ignore the needs of so many people around them while hoarding real estate and mountains of cash.   


I used to be a defender of the church as well. I get it. I got so sick of people speaking bad about my church because, as a member, I REALLY knew what the church taught. I honestly get it. However, I also know what it's like to be forced to peek outside the bubble, and follow facts and history to determine truth instead of what one religion tells me to believe. It's hard learning that the church you grew up respecting is literally nothing like what it is in reality. I truly hope you can find your way out of the cult someday.

The men would accept the arrangement because if they accepted, THEY TOO would be allowed to fuck little kids

Heber C Kimball ended up with 43 girls to fuck by the time he died. All he had to do is give up his 14 year old daughter Helen to be raped by a pervert until he died

Ordinances are two way agreements with god and if you are unwilling to do your part then why would you expect to still be able to do the ordinance? That’s not a threat at all, it’s common sense.

3408,gypn1uy,2021-05-19,t1_gypk58d,wallstreetbets,"God *has* prepared a way, His way being the church is financially stable enough to do so. Back in the days when those teachings were being taught they didn't have nearly any of the things or responsibilites we have now. It's a completely different atmosphere. They're given a yearly stipend so that when they are off traveling across the world their families are taken care of. They don't live in the lap of luxury and they're definitely not getting rich off of it. And any wealth they do have came from their professions or books they write.

Tithing is a spiritual law, not a physical law. God does not need our money. He gives us the commandment to pay tithing to increase our faith and keep our focus on Him. Obedience brings blessings. A lot of our commandments are for us and our *spiritual* growth. And almost all if not all of the Q15 have struggled financially at some point in their lives. I just listened to an Elder Holland talk, thst he gave many years after the fact, talking about his struggles as a young father, financially and emotionally. They remember. They understand. They are not heartless leaders sitting atop their towers basking in their wealth. They are constantly among members, visiting members, and staying with members. 

Yes, the local leaders of the church give exorbitantly of their time without financial compensation and it's very difficult. I don't have any response to that, although as a Young Women president, the thought of being paid or wanting to be paid or thinking I deserved to get paid because of my service never even came close to my thoughts. I don't serve for the money. Bishops and stake presidents though are crazy busy, I don't know how they feel about wanting compensation.

A janitor would be nice. I have found the very few times I have cleaned the church, it helps me realize what it takes to maintain those buildings and gives me more respect for them and helps me treat them with that respect. Amd the ome time I was able to clean the temple, I absolutely loved it and was glad I had the chance to do it.

Q1 2021 results in-line with expectations. Cash balance of $985 million. Increasing full-year operating expense guidance range by $30 million to include PEAR program costs (explicitly excluded from prior guidance). Capital expenditure guidance unchanged.

Majority of Fisker Ocean Bill of Material (BOM) now sourced, improving cost visibility across the entire model range at targets previously communicated. 

Foxconn binding agreement completed and initial production in U.S. confirmed. Design of PEAR vehicle locked and program concept phase kicked off. Several suppliers already nominated and the program is benefiting from meaningful supply chain synergies with Ocean.

Reservations total more than 16,000 as of today. More than 50% of reservation-holders are from outside the SUV segment, indicating a potentially larger addressable market than expected.

Talent acquisition accelerated in 2021, with a total of 203 full-time employees onboard as of today, compared to 101 as of December 31, 2020.

From what I’ve found through some deep dives done by parties outside the meme stock craze (papers were written years ago after 08/09) it’s absolutely bananas what these guys are allowed to het away with.  

Unfortunately the only way (two ways Ill explain the other later) right now to trace the synthetic shares to the creators is by going over every day’s transactions for the last decade trade by trade then sue the creators for dillution. They hide it way to trick the systems so they can’t be tracked.  

Good news for us is we’ve made such a big deal out of it there are teams of lawyers already doing that for the lawsuits that will happen.  Probably start after the June 2 share count. 

Better news is Amc is a dividend company, which means as soon as they start handing them out again even if it’s a penny a share.  The creators of the synthetic shares are obligated to pay that dividend.  That leaves a money trail.

It shouldn't be complicated 

Consider it from the perspective that maybe, just *maybeeee*, the holy ghost isn't talking to you. Or maybe doesn't exist at all

>So you’re saying that the promptings felt continue to prove to us a perspective in which we only take in information that agrees with what we believe?

I'm saying that humans have conscious thought 

>I mean, yeah? lol that’s what faith is. You wanna call it confirmation bias have at it homie

But your faith is in a religion with a disgusting history. Why? 

>And sure our conscience plays a role (light of Christ) as well as humans have the innate desire to do good, but the Holy Ghost plays off of that to continue to guide us in the right direction.

I dealt with the idea that i was wrong for the longest time until i realized that none of the problems that people brought up were actually problems and for the most part had reasonable explanations to them. 

Look here. There’s three perspectives about a given “controversy”. There’s the church one, the unbiased one, and the anti one. I read all three for a given situation. After reading all three for a decent bit of the issues i thought existed, i realized a pattern in which the dissenting perspective was full of wording and negative outlook that made the issue seem like an issue, or made it seem much worse than it in actuality was. I only realized this after looking at the unbiased facts of the story. Rarely did i ever take the church perspective until the very end where i realized it lined up considerably well with what the unbiased factual source stated.

I only know vague details but I know it’s funded using profit from other businesses owned by the church like the news company’s or thrift stores in Utah, and obviously it’s own gains. This is because iirc using tithes or donations would get the church in a very shifty situation legally as that would bring to question whether they legally qualify as a religious organization.

The church offers millions of aid yearly to people regardless of faith. They're often the first on the scene for major disasters like hurricane katrina and have been all over the world responding to crises like the famine in Mozambique. The more you have the more you can give. The most typical reply is ""all of that doesn't cost 100 billion! they should give more!"" Well no, they invest to produce an organization capable of perpetual giving. A lot of good is being done and more can be done with more funds. No one is pocketing these funds for personal wealth. 

And why should members choose where they serve? How is that at all evidence of corruption? Not even in businesses do people choose where they go on their trips. It's called an assignment for a reason. 

""You literally CANNOT go to the temple if you aren't a full-tithe payer. Which means you CANNOT participate in the saving ordinances that allow you to go to the celestial kingdom and be with your family for eternity. And you dare to claim that tithing ISN'T a threat? HOW?!?!? Please use common sense and tell me how that's not a threat. ""

You literally CANNOT get into college if you don't submit an application + fees. You CANNOT join the American Medical Association without paying membership dues. You literally CANNOT join a fraternity without pledging, you literally CANNOT receive the blessings of following God if you don't do the things God says are required to receive them. 

These are not threats, they're conditions. Everything in life operates around conditions. If the church really is legit, then God has stated the following conditions. And if eternal life and families are really so important to you, then it's silly you'd give them up for 10% of your income.

No i don’t believe our thoughts are only coming from the Holy Ghost. I believe our thoughts are influenced from Him. Considering we’re in a fallen state, our “promptings” are more in the line of interpretations of what God wants us to do, not the pure idea, if that makes sense. 

Off of that, i believe the Holy Ghost directs us to do Gods will, so good things in a general sense. Good is also based on the individual except for morally right and wrong ideas, again, if that makes sense. What’s good for me and what’s good for you have some overlap but not exactly the same. 

I still don’t think Holy Ghost = Confirmation bias

I see the idea you’re trying to get at, but it’s not really what i believe or feel like most people in my faith believe. I feel like our conscience and thoughts play a role, idk what, but they exist. 

Honestly this is all getting really convoluted in my head so none of that probably made sense tbh.

But assuming I'm replying to the right comment chain here, thanks for clarifying. Yea, sure if you are standing from the outside then I can see why you'd protest a religion that takes money for fake problems. However your other thread is challenging the internal logic within the religion, which I addressed. Your reply of ""lol okay bud"" was ... not very informative :) 

But that's the core element of any religion, that if you believe it, then you have to evaluate if the internal theology makes sense. No one is profiting off of the reserve fund. The 6 billion dollar expenses cover operating costs for 31,000 congregations, activities, education subsidies etc. The invested remaining 1 billion  (tithing surplus) that is now a multi billion dollar fund shows no evidence of profiting either. So honestly, it doesn't seem all that weird. As far as we can tell, funds, even if currently held in reserve, really all do go towards building the church.

Some people may short as the price starts to fall.

But I do try to think about game theory. There are those who are actively choosing to fuck people because they just want profit, there are those not thinking about it and just trying to maximize profits, and there are those who are trying to maximize EVERYONES profits.

Full disagree. You're seriously exaggerating here, imo. While there are outages, especially with Coinbase, they've got way better over the last few years. I've had maybe one or two issues over the past year. Heck, you can even use Coinbase Pro, no issues at all. I've had most of my assets on Coinbase since 2017 and don't regret it at all. 

I also don't understand what you mean by 'holding them on an exchange is a bad idea', followed by 'moving your coins to an exchange for urgent trades is extremely unreliable'. If you're holding your coins on the exchange (like coinbase), then you remove the step of moving them there in order to 'make urgent trades'.

   Just wondering if any other E\*TRADE account holders with OTC accounts receive this email this morning?  

New rules will affect your ability to buy and sell “Pink No Information” securities, including at E\*TRADE  
  
On September 28, 2021, new requirements take effect that will impact the market for—and value of—certain “over-the-counter (OTC) securities” you currently hold or have held in the past. The new rules apply to “Pink No Information” OTC securities of companies that fail to publicly report and keep current financial and other company information and will restrict the ability of U.S. brokers, like E\*TRADE from making these products generally available.

They sent a link to the Amendment that was adopted last September.  I have checked a few of the stocks I hold and only ONE has met this requirement in YEARS.  Most of them penny stocks I purchased in December 2020  after the September 2020 Amendment was adopted, and are still have negative return.

6950,gypyerz,2021-05-19,t1_gypj80g,wallstreetbets,"My church was NOT created to have sex with young girls. That is horrible and disgusting. Joseph Smith did NOT choose his apostles if they had sex with young girls and then turned them over to him. That is a HUGE lie. People did not join the early church to do that, and Joseph Smith did not get shot because of this. Yes, he his friends and brothers were shot multiple times through a door in Liberty Jail, but it was because he was a ""Mormon"", and they didn't understand our beliefs. Mobs drove Smith's family from their home and they drove the entirety of the church out of their homes. This organization DOES NOT invite men to have sex with younger girls. If you don't believe me when I say that we DO NOT commit these heinous crimes, then with all due respect, please ponder who knows more about the history of my church. I have been a member for more than 16 years and find great interest in its history. I would know. :) This organization DOES NOT commit those crimes. If we did, then why aren't we all in jail? 

Secondly, people like to get all high and mighty when they hear we give 10% of our income to the church. Why do we give 10%? That tithing goes to building and maintaining our temples, buying land for those temples, maintaining church historical sites, sending out missionaries, major donation efforts, most recently one of the largest covid relief efforts created by a religious organization, maintaining our welfare program for less fortunate members, which includes a massive supply chain from our farms, church sponsored logistics teams for those efforts, the list goes on. I donate because I believe that all of those things are good things. If my money does not go to those things, it will go into church savings. And that isn't a bad thing, because if times require for action on our part my money will be used in helping others. :)

I respect you for bringing this up. Most people think that we abuse and mistreat women like this, and that is not true. If I was in your shoes I would also be upset at my religion, because you have reason to not support us if you think we commit such crimes. The fact that you are bringing this up out of concern shows that you care, and I greatly respect you for that! :)",[],1

7037,gypypi8,2021-05-19,t3_ng1nlz,wallstreetbets,"For those of you who don't understand the basic math of a  
legitimate ""Short Squeeze"" --  
Short Sellers sell shares to buyers at the highest available  
Bid price because they have calculated that they can buy back those shares at a  
lower price later.    
For some Short Sellers there is a careful process of  
research, combing through financials, assessment of market direction,  
price-history analysis etc. which gives them a strong conviction that the stock  
that they are shorting will go down and they will make money by buying it back  
for less than they sold it for.  For,  
most, however, the approach is much more like a pack of hyenas following a herd  
of elephants . . . they assume that at some point, the biggest will eventually  
fall and make for a huge easy meal.  
A Short Squeeze happens when the hyenas realize that the big  
old elephant that they thought was going to be a feast turns out to only be  
napping.  And as the elephant rises, the  
hyenas have to make their escape.  
The only problem is, for the Short Sellers to escape, they  
have to buy back the shares that they sold at the current ASK price.  So as the stock rises, they are forced to  
chase the Ask up and up.  The fewer  
Sellers in the market place, the more desperate the Shorts are to make their  
escape.  
What we are seeing today is AMD's board saying, ""We're  
not dead, for sure.""  And the hyenas  
all know what that means . . . unless they are certain, they need to beat a  
hasty retreat!",[],0

They encourage you to save to pay for it but they will if you dont have money my apartment in one area was $2,500 a month) it also pays for the free copies of material the church gives out to people, App development to access learning material online, the website, Satellite broadcasts, family history, and other things directly related to the church and teaching people about God. Every month we have fast offerings (once a month we remember those in need by fasting either not eating 2 meals, not using your phone for the day, or whatever is a sacrifice to you to remember those who have not.) You can donate to the ""fast offerings"" which is optional and not required at all by the church but is the fund that the church uses to donate to charities or pay for food for others or donations for natural disasters which the church has donated i think over $2.3 Billion so far all paid for by the members donating to the fast offering fund.

7331,gypzpue,2021-05-19,t1_gypw0fh,wallstreetbets,"Semiconductor engineer here holding $2000 of AMD. My bull case for them is basically ""inverse Intel"". 

It's hard to overstate how critical process nodes are for semiconductors. Move to a smaller node and you get more speed at less power for free - zero negative tradeoffs at least for digital. 

Intel is stuck on a node they first introduced in 2014 and planned to move off in 2016, but every attempt they've tried has failed. Not improving in 7 years is DEATH in semis. OTOH, AMD's manufacturing partner is now 3 nodes ahead of Intel. That's 3 generations worth of more speed at lower power. Even if Intel started catching up tomorrow, their technology is five years behind AMD dead minimum. 

And is Intel pulling out all the stops to catch up, seeing a life or death threat to their CPU business? Fuuuck no. They're buying back shares to bait boomer investors back in and reshuffling the C-suite. Meanwhile, AMD's manufacturing partner is investing $100 BILLION over the next 3 years to extend their lead. Semi manufacturing just might be the most capital intensive business on earth and they treat it as such.

AMD has awesome leadership (Su Bae is a PhD electrical engineer, she gets this business), low debt, a reasonable P/E, something like 6 consecutive blowout earnings reports, and they're taking share from Intel. Everything about them screams green light IMO. I have no idea why their stock is punished so much. Su Bae doesn't either, hence the buyback.


Nvidia is a really good company too with a ton of upside, but they are very expensive right now. 

TXN is a ""slow and steady"" type stock... they focus on stable, low-growth old school technology and use their expertise at boomer tech and deep vendor relationships to hang on to market share. I like them, but they're not going to grow quickly and they are already priced high. I'd buy them on a big correction dip.

Intel is dying and not even a 12 P/E can suck me back in.

The difference I see with this particular religion compared to so many others, is that it is SO EASILY disproven using historical data and facts. The fact that the church misrepresents its history, and hides it from its own members, or constantly changes its teachings while disavowing what previous prophets taught as scripture, is what is concerning. These members aren't being given the full picture of the religion, its history, and the circumstances surrounding its founding, so they cannot know exactly what kind of organization they are donating to. I'm not saying they church doesn't do ANY good on the planet, I know there are some people they help (though not NEARLY enough considering the virtually bottomless resources they have, but whatever). I'm saying that the only reason they amassed this wealth in the first place, was by deceiving and misleading people. I am angry that my tithing funds went to a church that spent MILLIONS trying to fight gay marriage, something it has absolutely ZERO right to do, affecting lives of non-members.  I am angry that my family continues to donate 10 percent of their income to this religion because they worry about being left behind in the afterlife, that those funds could be going towards retirement, or ACTUAL people it can help instead of a bottomless well of money the church already has. You cannot and will not convince me that this ""religion"" is anything other than a sham and an affront to what it means to represent ""god."" Like others have said, it may as well be the church of Donald Trump for all I care, it's just as sleazy.

While I'd reserve my comment why such a big topics (Kasruth) is only vaguely represented by couple of verses in Koran? You really need to at least read up Kashrut Law (try Google) as this is the original source of ""Halal"". 

That said,

NO, Halal is A LOT MORE THAN slaughtering in the name of God and letting the animal bleed out... It's supposed to be the Superfood Technology that will leave present day's quantum computing in the dust. And it's not free... just because Muslim authorities do not profit from Halal as aggressively as Rabbis does not mean it's not a business. It just mean Muslims are no match for Jews when it comes to commerce... Money $$$.

I say you haven't been eating halal all your life... And that Allah will not give credit for those observing PARTIAL halal like what Muslims have been doing since the inception of Islam.

Abstinence from consuming pork alone does not make one Halal because there is no such thing PARTIAL Halal.... Religion is either Black or white, there is no grey area. Having said that, I urge all good Muslims to ditch Halal and live like a true Children of Allah.

Now go sample some yummilicious bacon, chow down a Red Lobster, and gobble up a Peking duck, (etc... millions more here).

After all, PORK IS GOOD FOR YOU ( so is seafood)

Pork is a rich source of certain vitamins and minerals your body needs to function, like iron and zinc. It's also an excellent source of high-quality protein. Minimally processed, lean, fully-cooked pork eaten in moderation can provide certain benefits when added to your diet. https://www.webmd.com/diet/pork-good-for-you#:\~:text=Pork%20is%20a%20rich%20source,when%20added%20to%20your%20diet.

Also we're talking about 4 people selling at under $30 for a total value of less than $10 million. The company is approaching $2 billion valuation today and it would've been over double that when they sold. I get the suspicion of insider selling but in the grand scheme of things it was a drop in the bucket and I do not blame them for taking profits.

7611,gyq0ouc,2021-05-19,t1_gypteuc,wallstreetbets,"I would also add that many, many members do not ""choose"" to believe in church teachings. The teachings are ingrained from birth. They sing songs in primary from as young as age 3-4  like ""Follow the Prohet, Don't Go Astray,"" and are taught that when they turn 8 years old they are going to make ""the choice"" to be baptized. NO 8 YEAR OLD CHILD CAN COMPREHEND WHAT THEY ARE REALLY DOING WHEN THEY ARE BEING BAPTIZED/JOINING A RELIGION. They have been told by their parents, their leaders, literally everyone they know, for as long as they have been alive, without being able to see other perspectives, that it's the most important decision they can make, and that they can't go to heaven without it.  And the teaching continues about going to the temple, paying tithing, following commandments, etc. So no, I do not buy for a second that most members are following this church willfully, because they have been brainwashed into doing so. If everyone in the church knew the full history of the church, Joseph Smith and his treasure hunting, the racism, the polyandry, etc. the church would not be in the position that it is today.

outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10   
diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now **would be sitting out**   
and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10   
level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support   
afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

What I love about Marcos is his vision. He believes he can take his oppressed people and let them be the ones who seize humanity’s future, not have them starve in the shadows of Earth and Mars. He saw the ring as the future of all of the rest of humanity, and recognized that he wanted to claim it exclusively for the Belters. He isn’t wrong at all - and if he wins (which so far it seems he has) than history will remember him as a great leader and righteous savior of the Belt, ushering in the true space-age of humanity.

If you SELL the 408c you get a credit. You get paid. 

Then you have a spread. 

Then tomorrow BUY back the 408c and SELL the 407c which will close the the spread. And you will get more money tomorrow. 

Check the guide I wrote. There should be pictures. I’m guessing you are using RH so it should help you. Good luck!

8212,gyq2qx1,2021-05-19,t1_gypzrvm,wallstreetbets,"I mean the church does not misrepresent its history any more than does the four gospels. And people are free to read whatever book they want. It's not like there's a restricted section of the Hogwarts Library somewhere in the basement of the church head quarters. 

And the whole concept of faith is you could spend your entire life trying to prove something right or wrong, but at the end of the day there are infinite questions that can be asked about anything. It will never stop if that is your metric. Lots of those questions are important, and lots are simply moot. If you genuinely believe there is any god out there, and you pray and decide the church is real, then you figure out the rest as you go. It's not for your to decide for other people what they believe no matter how frustrating that might be. 

And again, you attempt to declare how other people should spend their money while having zero idea of why they opted to maintain a reserve fund in the first place. It really is presumptuous. 

And how did they amass wealth by deceiving people? I see that you say that, but not how you show that's the case. And while the church is not political it reserves the right to weigh in on social issues that have consequence for society as a whole. Don't worry I'm well aware of all of that, I was in cali when prop 8 was going on. 

And as in all things, in the church people can choose to pay tithing or they can choose not to. Don't you remember those talks that said ""there are generally three reasons why people follow the commandments. 1. a fear of punishment, 2. a desire for the reward, 3. a genuine love of god and desire to please him."" Whether or not your parents ascribe to #1, you definitely project that that is their motivation. It's effective at producing a doom and gloom argument, but for most people they really don't see it that way. At the very least, that is not the end goal. 

And again you acknowledge that the church helps people, and it really does, and then immediately go back to saying it doesnt help actual people. The purpose of the church is to share the gospel to non-believers and believers and to enrich the learning and experience of members. Donating to food banks (which there are plenty of btw) is not the only way that's done. It also requires church programs and meeting houses and seminary and institute etc etc etc. All of these fulfill the genuine purpose of religion, which is to bring people to God, and yet, because you dont see them dump their entire surplus into one lump sum of humanitarian aid, they're a sham religion? The church is not a soup kitchen. It is a church. First and foremost it is to foster, teach and enrich lives with the gospel. It does a really good job at that. It also does a really good job coordinating relief all around the world. it ALSO does a great job teaching people to sacrifice by encouraging them to donate to wellfare funds, tithing, fast offerings etc. and yes, even missioonary service. Why? because the church is to bring people closer to god and as part of their theology, that means learning to be like him. So encouraging people to learn how to think about other people and donate does NOT mean that they are hoarding money and not spending their own, it's teaching people who to contribute to a bigger whole. What would be the purpose of a church that never asks anything of its members? What lesson would be taught? That someone else will do it for you? That you don't personally have to sacrifice? Honestly, THAT would be a sham religion.",[],0

Since Mar 29 recent low for silver around $23.80 to recent high $28.80....  that $5 move equated to a 150% Gain/Return on futures contracts if entered at low and exited at high.  Futures have a Preferred Taxation of 60% Long/ 40% Short Term meaning Reduced Tax Liability.  Due Diligence to enter and exit cycles will equate to a Huge Gain using Futures which run from Sunday 5 Pm until Friday 5 Pm continuously except for a 1 hour break each day from 4 to 5 pm CST.    Hope that brings some attention for unknowing.  HOWEVER... WARNING.... BE AWARE OF CONTRACT ROLLOVER DATES meaning Expiration of current futures contract which could put you in a REAL HURTBAG.....

How is anyone going to afford a house or make money building houses with that kind of hike?

Eviction flood may be coming, but I don't think thats why lumber is falling, and I think it has further to go unless some sudden spike in home building (which it is summertime and certain states REALLY NEED it, like Cali).

TL;DR. Lumber is falling, needs to fall more. Not directly tied to potential eviction crisis I think though. Maybe the ridiculous costs could hold a little bit longer if investors weren't potentially holding cash for foreclosures but lumber price is absolutely insane, not even moderately insane.",[],0

And sure they've been told, and they're free to leave. Again, consider yourself Exhibit A. Those members who follow only because they were told to always fail in the end when things become difficult, their faith is challenged, or something else more alluring comes their way. I see it over and over and over again. And that's fine. Those who stick with it, who try to understand it, do so willingly.

End result is that returns in 1950-1980 were low in the market as stocks were declining in value due to the increasing interest rates (i.e. as the risk-free rate of return increased the required return for stocks increased) and from 1980 onward stocks went up to reflect the lower risk-free rate of return.

It goes with that whole ""milk before meat"" thing. Somethings just don't make sense without context and some things just never make sense even with context. Some people feel like kids need more context before tackling seemingly bizarre topics. But overtime yea, things make sense. Polygamy is not a foreign concept among righteous people in the bible. But I'm not here to argue doctrines and in this whole exchange I have not been defending the church itself. You have made several fallacious and unfounded accusations regarding the church and all I have done is to point out the fallacy and clarify the premises in question. I have not made a case on behalf of the church beyond that, which is why I really have zero interest in defending the other issues you brought up about treasure hunting. While your take on those events may differ than mine, you've stated no fallacy and so there's no reason for me to speak up.   


And you are too quick to assume that people do not investigate every in and out before deciding what to believe. I'm scientist by trade and grew up in a family that was split down the middle, half liking the church and half despising it and trying everything they could to get me to ""see"" the truth. But every argument was laced with fallacy. No matter how brilliant they or you all imagined themselves to be, fallacy is never an adequate substitute for reality.

As far as long term, material shortages don’t last forever. Not all their revenue come from new construction sales (it’s actually quite small). Their Debt to equity ratio is 0.45 which is very low. The P/E ratio is also low compared to the industry and the market.",[],1

AMC ran with GME the first time and now GME is running with AMC now. I don't see this getting above 20 not matter how much ""data"" there is to support it. But, I was surprised it ran this high though so take that for what it is worth.

There are soooo many people involved in this movement that have zero knowledge about the stock market. Those will be shaken out by this weekend if AMC stays around $12. The ride ends before it even starts.

I wish we had someone with actual knowledge that could explain what is happening with the hedge funds. They don't have the same brokers/rules as retail. Are they really paying these prices? Do they really have a chance to get margin called? All points I would like to see instead we get ""MOON!!!""","['GME', 'AMC']",0
