1. The time frame of the algorithm is critical. Their first major advance and first time they made money, was because the took their existing approach and changed from making long term predictions to making short-medium term predictions
2. Gathering as much data as possible and then developing algorithms that can leverage as much of that data that is useful, by combining the signals in some way. This implies to me a form of ensemble learning or possibly reinforcement learning, and having a really good way of estimating the accuracy and reliability of each signal
3. Effectively managing bet size (not just timing)
4. Knowing when to exit a position is critical, taking a profit or minimizing a loss
5. Cutting trading and execution costs to a minimum is very important. They outline how a bug in the code was costing them a tonne of money until it was removed by a new engineering hire, IIRC. Their edge per trade is tiny, so cutting costs while maintaining a large transaction volume is how they make a lot of their money.
6. Moving to a single underlying algorithm across different instruments allowed them to concentrate on making one really good model vs a number of mediocre ones.
7. They were initially much more successful in other markets and it took them a long while to make money in equities. I forget whether it was bonds or commodities or something else where they were first successful, but it wasn't in equities.",[],0

My state transition is dynamic depending on live data. It's more like reading the current state matrix & the model will come up w/ a coefficient that decides whether to buy/hold/sell.

Nbbo rules, orders are sold to internalizers not routed to market so you're getting a better execution compared to the DISPLAYED liquidity which is all that matters.

>Aren't HFTs incentivised to execute as low as possible while still remaining in the NBBO?

HFTs are incentivized to get the most order flow, they do this by providing the best price improvement to the broker. Better the price improvement, the larger % of volume they receive from said broker. Every two weeks, brokers compare PFOF providers PI data to determine who gets what % of order flow.",[],0
177,gzf3tq2,2021-05-25,t1_gzerw1t,algotrading,"The cost function can be very tricky to design. You cannot simply use maximizing networth as a cost function because it might not learn anything most of the time or it will consider hodl as most optimal strategy and would not be optimal.

Also, an inherent problem with RL is, it works optimally on known cases ie the data pattern or trend it has seen in the past. Which generally due to stochasticity wouldn't  be as optimal.

Another reason is the issue of the changin environment and action space choices.

Generally in RL the environment is stable meaning and the action choices has the same outcomes in almost all cases. In case of stock market when the agent moves to a new state the environment changes drastically, say if the stock is at all time high or has a very steep rise it wouldn't have optimal strategy then. In short, the movement of the agent would change the environment itself and consequently the rules of the environment. Also there is no guarantee that the learned strategy is an optimal one as everytime you train the strategy changes slightly and in a stochastic environment it can have a cascading effect.

 These issues might not look too complex at first but these are the problem that is currently preventing RL from industry use.",[],0

1. The time frame of the algorithm is critical. Their first major advance and first time they made money, was because the took their existing approach and changed from making long term predictions to making short-medium term predictions
2. Gathering as much data as possible and then developing algorithms that can leverage as much of that data that is useful, by combining the signals in some way. This implies to me a form of ensemble learning or possibly reinforcement learning, and having a really good way of estimating the accuracy and reliability of each signal
3. Effectively managing bet size (not just timing)
4. Knowing when to exit a position is critical, taking a profit or minimizing a loss
5. Cutting trading and execution costs to a minimum is very important. They outline how a bug in the code was costing them a tonne of money until it was removed by a new engineering hire, IIRC. Their edge per trade is tiny, so cutting costs while maintaining a large transaction volume is how they make a lot of their money.
6. Moving to a single underlying algorithm across different instruments allowed them to concentrate on making one really good model vs a number of mediocre ones.

My state transition is dynamic depending on live data. It's more like reading the current state matrix & the model will come up w/ a coefficient that decides whether to buy/hold/sell.

Nbbo rules, orders are sold to internalizers not routed to market so you're getting a better execution compared to the DISPLAYED liquidity which is all that matters. Interacting with non-displayed liquidity isn't a feature of retail brokerages. You'll need to go with a DMA provider for that (and pay for the execution)

HFTs are incentivized to get the most order flow, they do this by providing the best price improvement to the broker.

Also, an inherent problem with RL is, it works optimally on known cases ie the data pattern or trend it has seen in the past. Which generally due to stochasticity wouldn't  be as optimal.

Another reason is the issue of the changin environment and action space choices.

Generally in RL the environment is stable meaning and the action choices has the same outcomes in almost all cases. In case of stock market when the agent moves to a new state the environment changes drastically, say if the stock is at all time high or has a very steep rise it wouldn't have optimal strategy then. In short, the movement of the agent would change the environment itself and consequently the rules of the environment. Also there is no guarantee that the learned strategy is an optimal one as everytime you train the strategy changes slightly and in a stochastic environment it can have a cascading effect.

1. The time frame of the algorithm is critical. Their first major advance and first time they made money, was because the took their existing approach and changed from making long term predictions to making short-medium term predictions
2. Gathering as much data as possible and then developing algorithms that can leverage as much of that data that is useful, by combining the signals in some way. This implies to me a form of ensemble learning or possibly reinforcement learning, and having a really good way of estimating the accuracy and reliability of each signal
3. Effectively managing bet size (not just timing)
4. Knowing when to exit a position is critical, taking a profit or minimizing a loss
5. Cutting trading and execution costs to a minimum is very important. They outline how a bug in the code was costing them a tonne of money until it was removed by a new engineering hire, IIRC. Their edge per trade is tiny, so cutting costs while maintaining a large transaction volume is how they make a lot of their money.
6. Moving to a single underlying algorithm across different instruments allowed them to concentrate on making one really good model vs a number of mediocre ones.

You really want to achieve general fluency in whatever language you're going to be using -- detached from any trading specific application. You can use this general knowledge to more easily translate your ideas into code. Most 'crash course' style resources for algotrading that I've checked out leave much to be desired. Also realize that for this to be effective you'll have to momentarily set aside any thoughts of building a trading system to fully focus on becoming a better programmer, which might be frustrating. The same goes for learning math/stats, market microstructure, etc... 

If you approach this with the mentality of 'saving time' and learning as fast as possible, I don't see a good outcome, unless you're some sort of genius. Algotrading is a vast field that sits right at the intersection of finance, computer science, and statistics.

Very short term trends are easy enough to identify algorithmically and put up huge returns.  But reality is a bitch so if you want to minimize your risk look at longer time frames.  These can be harder to read accurately and won't return as much by a long shot but you derisk your exercise substantially and your net is the same with lower overall chance of shitting the bed totally.

645,gzj77qh,2021-05-26,t1_gziqxp2,algotrading,"Not exactly, because if it moves through without bounces you lose profit.  You make profit on a return to the same price, a bounce.  Say the price moves from 20 to 25 and then back to 20, of you catch that bounces it's 5$ profit.  But if there is 5 lines in that range, you get only 1$, because you rebuy on the way down, needing the equivalent of 5 times the price moving back and forth in that full range to make the same profit. Like 25 bounces.

The smaller the grid width, the higher the number of bounces it will have to make to get the same profit, squared.

Say you choose twice as many levels in your grid, you will need 4 ltimes as many bounces to get the same profit of the price were to move from bottom to top. 3 times as many lines, 9 times as many bounces. 
(It's not exactly that relation, but describes it well)

The secret to success is to not be greedy, and imagine the probability of the number of bounces on the full range.  If the price only zig zag 1-2 times on the way up, you are much better off not having levels catching those bounces.

The perfect grid bot has only 2 lines.

1. Create a function that finds local extremas within af given range.
2. Use a sequence of extrema points (minima for support, maxima for resistance) to create several a regression lines. Note, that the points for the regression lines should be formed for various combinations from the sequence. i.e point 1,2, 4 and 6 in a sequence going from 1-8.  
3. Discard all regression lines where the slope is not close to being horizontal and where the regression line is positioned far enough away from the moving average of the points using some sort of threshold value.
4. Regression lines that satisfies both conditions in (3)  should resemble support/resistance levels. You have to experiment with how you implement your algorithm for building regression lines using combinatorics from your sequences of extremas.",[],0

I've been replicating an academic paper on firm-specific risk in emerging markets and adding a machine learning element to predict and aggregate portfolios based on expected idiosyncratic volatility, and some of the highest expected volatility portfolios have annualized returns above 50%. In reality, those portfolios may even underperform when liquidity of small markets is taken into account.",[],1
841,gzj51so,2021-05-26,t3_nlif5f,algotrading,"I have found the most value in doing competitive coding (codewars, leetcode, google codejam, etc...).  Codewars is especially nice because of the simple difficulty/topic system, and the fact that you can see others' implementation of the solution after you pass the tests. I've learned a ton that way.

You really want to achieve general fluency in whatever language you're going to be using -- detached from any trading specific application. You can use this general knowledge to more easily translate your ideas into code. Most 'crash course' style resources for algotrading that I've checked out leave much to be desired. Also realize that for this to be effective you'll have to momentarily set aside any thoughts of building a trading system to fully focus on becoming a better programmer, which might be frustrating. The same goes for learning math/stats, market microstructure, etc... 

If you approach this with the mentality of 'saving time' and learning as fast as possible, I don't see a good outcome, unless you're some sort of genius. Algotrading is a vast field that sits right at the intersection of finance, computer science, and statistics.

Say the price moves from 20 to 25 and then back to 20, of you catch that bounces it's 5$ profit.  But if there is 5 lines in that range, you get only 1$, because you rebuy on the way down, needing the equivalent of 5 times the price moving back and forth in that full range to make the same profit. Like 25 bounces.

The smaller the grid width, the higher the number of bounces it will have to make to get the same profit, squared.

Say you choose twice as many levels in your grid, you will need 4 ltimes as many bounces to get the same profit of the price were to move from bottom to top. 3 times as many lines, 9 times as many bounces. 
(It's not exactly that relation, but describes it well)

The secret to success is to not be greedy, and imagine the probability of the number of bounces on the full range.  If the price only zig zag 1-2 times on the way up, you are much better off not having levels catching those bounces.

The perfect grid bot has only 2 lines.

1) your amout of skill 
2) the average skill of new entrants.

It is simplified ok, but the idea remains the same. Markets should behave more systematically (against erratically) (example if every one know that 100 is a resistance then it increase the power of that resistance)

Most of retail algo are pretty dumb if you can somehow exploit the same indicator you can literally spoil the order flow. The only limitation is the available liquidity for your move.
