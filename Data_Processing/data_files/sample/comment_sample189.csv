Director level and above often have no technical understanding of there products beyond a surface level and focus on decision making based on performance metrics for cost and schedule that are too simple to gather a real understanding of what’s happening.

But so is Chile. There is no “socialism” as far as total government control of the means of production. Even under Allende there was still a functioning market economy. Nationalizing specific industries does not make a country socialist, I would agree with that, but I am trying to get clear on exactly what you determine to be socialist.

I’d agree also that functioning social democracies are capitalistic and have property rights, but they have also nationalized industries and put controls on the market in certain areas, so are these socialistic policies? I don’t agree with the blanket assessment that putting power in the hands of the government is necessarily a bad thing, provided that the government is genuinely representative of the people.

Those social democracies are a good example of that because while the market does exist, it is considered a secondary priority to ensuring that people have basic standards of living.

In my view, any transaction explicitly undertaken with manipulative intent is a bright line violation of the law. If your primary or sole intent in a transaction is to manipulate the market price, that is illegal market manipulation. It doesn't matter if everyone knows you are doing it; the intent is the issue.

Of course, whether a transaction is or is not manipulative is very different than whether or not manipulation is easy or worth it to prove in an enforcement action. Given that every transaction affects market price to some degree, there is a huge gray area.

I’d agree also that functioning social democracies are capitalistic and have property rights, but they have also nationalized industries and put controls on the market in certain areas, so are these socialistic policies? I don’t agree with the blanket assessment that putting power in the hands of the government is necessarily a bad thing, provided that the government is genuinely representative of the people.

Those social democracies are a good example of that because while the market does exist, it is considered a secondary priority to ensuring that people have basic standards of living.

[https://www.investopedia.com/investing/how-interest-rates-affect-stock-market/](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/how-interest-rates-affect-stock-market/)

However, I still don't understand why it will lead to such a big fall. 

I am just thinking aloud here...

I mean, I understand that the increase in rates by the Fed will lead to increase in the interest rates that banks offer to companies, and thus if a company has a lot of debt, it will suffer. But how about companies that are sitting on billions of cash like Apple and google? How will it affect them? If the interest rate hikes, then won't they be able to use that cash to eat away a good portion of their debt and compensate for the increase in rates?

Even for the companies that have a big debt, it is not like they run everything on debt. Also, if inflation catches up everywhere, the price of products will also increase, so somehow compensating for the increases interest that these companies are paying.. but maybe there will be quite some considerable time lag between the increase in bank interest rates and the increase of product prices? And maybe the increase in product prices will lead to less sales?   But if it is essential product, then people have no option, right? I mean, if the price of cooking oil increases, even doubles, we will complain but will still buy it.  But for the non essential items (e.g. clothing accessories, dinning out, ...), maybe there will be a big hit?

* there's a difference between notional value and the actual price he paid for these put options. the 530 million is very likely the notional value of these puts, not the price he paid. unless Burry has some secret undisclosed positions, look at his 13F, his whole portfolio is worth less than 200 million. 
* when buying puts, the puts with a lower strike price will be less expensive than the higher ones. for example, stock price is 100$, puts with a strike price of 105$ will be priced higher than those with a strike price of 95$.
* Burry most likely made a bet here, so the chances he bought puts at a strike price higher than the then actual price of Tesla is very unlikely. He probably bought OTM puts options which are less expensive, thus the price paid for this position is somewhere between 1 million and 25 million (it's a long range bcuz we can't be sure about the exact price he paid), depending on the puts maturity and other factors, but it's definitely not 530 million. 
* if you do 530000000/(8000\*100)=662.50, chances are that these puts have a strike price of 662.50$. This is more or less an average, since if you look at TSLA options chain, there's no strike price of 662.50, thus Burry might have bought puts with several different strike prices. the 530 million notional value is probably also an average of the notional values of the puts.
* these puts were bought when the actual price of Tesla was way above the average strike price of 662.50$, i.e. in the 700-800$ range, and given today's price, Burry already ""most likely"" made money on these puts.

Like web development, the entry bar is set very low because most apps are (or start out as) really simple. In this segment, you get low prices and you compete with tons of students, freelancers and local small businesses, all of which are perfectly capable of getting the job done. Being at a social occasion and hearing ""I have an idea for an app"" is a meme among programmers, and there are many who have built apps for local businesses. It does not scale up well.

With larger projects, most companies that have critical exposure to their customers via their apps either have de facto body leasing agreements with their preferred software consultancy or a standing in-house development team.

You may be able to find a software consultancy that does a lot of app development, but a pure play is unlikely. Often, mobile development is just a side show for them, and the real money is in ERP, CRM or custom enterprise development.",gyi5ofe,t3_nesfc2,[],1

Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in.

The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe).

683,2021-05-17,investing,"# Naked puts - am I understanding correctly?

You sell for a given premium you collect at sale, and it is a contract to buy from someone else at the strike price.

Meaning if the price goes below the strike (-premium), you lose money, and everything above is a win.

\--------------

In my mind, this is a contract to *buy*. Select a price you'd be thrilled to buy at, select a number of contracts to represent the shares you'd love to buy at that price point, and fire it off. Either the price goes low and you basically 'limit buy' at contract close at that price, regardless of how low it went, or you at least keep the premium. Semi win-win.

So what's with the 'naked' part? Why won't TDA let me do this? Do I need actual money sitting around doing nothing to 'cover' this in the even I have to buy? Is the value of my other stocks (in excess) not sufficient to act as collateral for that possibility?

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedput.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedput.asp)

This suggests what makes it naked is failing to also hold a short position - as though if you were also short, it would be covered. But how do you go short to cover the put? *Buy a put?* But that seems to defeat the purpose if you goal is to *sell* a put.

This Wikipedia passage puts it well 

> A socialist state is to be distinguished from a multi-party liberal democracy governed by a self-described socialist party, where the state is not constitutionally bound to the construction of socialism.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_state?wprov=sfti1

Electing a socialist leader or socialist representatives does not immediately make a state socialist. There needs to be a clear intention and plan for the state to proceed toward a socialist system. In the absence of that you have a democratic republic with socialist representatives which, as long as the people’s voice is being represented in government, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that at all. 

My only point to start all this was that democratic rights are paramount, not property rights. The right of someone to own property doesn’t supersede decisions arrived upon by a representative government, which is something we already tacitly accept because of the existence of taxation to fund even the most basic social necessities like roads, fire and police services, schools, libraries, etc.",gyie8rh,t1_gyib42n,[],0

754,2021-05-18,investing,"Options have variable called ""Greeks"" that determine the price of the option.

The main one I'm talking about is ""Delta"".

Delta is the $ value an option will increase/decrease by for every $1 change in the stock price that the option represents. An option with a delta of 0.5 means that if $SPY went down $1 your call option would go down by $0.50. In-the-money options have the highest delta among options. Really deep in-the-money options have delta values of 0.70 or higher.

Say a share of $SPY is worth $300 and an in-the-money call option is worth $30. If $SPY goes up $1 to $301 in a day that's a 0.33% return. Your in-the-money call option would go from $30 to $30.70, a 2.3% return.

It's a double edged sword though, because a high delta also magnifies the losses.

(After writing all this out, it turned into an essay. WTF am I doing. Also, this looks pretty boring. I swear its not actually!)

First of all, I feel nervous about valuations, so I am getting more serious about trying to buy great businesses at fair prices. Its not glamorous but I haven't lost all my money yet.... My approach is shifting more and more towards not-losing-money. (I'm not against growth, its just that 150 P/Es are a bit much for me right now.)

If I am curious about a business, the basic system for me is that I start with the general industry overview/trajectory etc. Then move to financials, then I check yahoo finance ratios, then read the 10k, and then I look at the stock price. Finally, I consider other peoples opinions/analysis from YouTube or reddit. Sometimes I consider what other high profile investors are doing too.

First I try to learn about the industry a business operates in. (A great way to think about industries, by the way, is Michael Porters ""5 Forces"") Basically I want to understand the barriers to entry, amount of competition, pricing power dynamics etc. Other factors like market size & growth are important too.

If I am still interested in a company, I start with the income statement and look for profitability. If its not profitable I need to find out why. Next I look for revenue growth. If revenue is growing but net losses are increasing, I am turned off (generally speaking)

Next I go to balance sheet check if they have the cash on hand to pay their current liabilities. I don't want a company that will have financing problems in the next 3 months. Next, I check the shares outstanding; is it growing or reducing? If share counts are growing, there better be a compelling reason. Then i look at debt levels; I want to understand how leveraged they are. If interest rates go up, I want to understand the effect it would have on profitability/cash burn.

Finally I try to consider the cash flow. Good business are making free cash flow. Bonus points if free cash flow covers CapEx, operating expenses, dividends, and leaves money left over.

Sometimes I look at the payout ratio. If I'm chasing a dividend, I don't want a business with a high payout ratio. My highest payout is a bank @ 50%. I would like room for the dividend to grow. I don't consider dividend yield %. IMO its more of an indicator of market sentiment of a stock.

It sounds kind of lame, but once I got a bit more experienced with financial statements, it really only takes 5 minutes. Honestly, its become fun.

If these numbers seem OK or interesting (and I'm genuinely interested in the company), I would read through the 10k more thoroughly to try to understand what management is thinking. I find this tedious and time consuming, but it helps me understand what is going on.

If I'm still interested, I will check the stock price and see what I think of the current valuation. If the current valuation seems reasonable to me, I'll look for a DCF (or dividend growth model or something) from someone. I find these things tedious build so I always Hope someone else has already done the math exercise for me. If I am feeling really motivated I'll go find all the data and build it myself. (I learned to do this in post secondary school)

Finally, If buying this business still seems like a good idea, I have to consider what I want to sell. Do I think this business is better than what I have?? 

That's generally how I approach my own due diligence. Since I took this approach, my portfolio has stopped swinging 20% either way in a day. I haven't had any crazy gains either. So far, this has mostly prevented me from losing money, while getting me market average/slightly above gains.

I do not personally believe this is taking on risk as it's highly unlikely the market won't return 3% over the course of 30 years. I look at it as prudent arbitrage. That's always risk.

I'm turning 25, have a stable job, and I have never invested before. I did some analysis of my career path and realized me working my ass off but can only afford a house at age of grey hair. I looked up for multiple streams of income which led me here.

The thing is, I watched hundreds of Youtube videos and read hundreds of articles about passive investing this week, which mostly suggests it is good to invest early and slowly build up the portfolio to multiply money. However, some sources suggest the stock market right now is extremely high because people jumped into speculative investing as they see prices going sky high, which brought the price even higher.

Knowing this is exactly why I wanted to invest, I started to question myself if I'm wrong to step into investing, but I don't want to live under debt and be the slave of the house. What would be your suggestion to me?

Idk I believe I have the fundamental investment knowledge and I have completed multiple professional learning modules about investing (ETF, options, structured warrants etc), but I am still confused.

Just anecdotal but I like what they offer a lot.

1097,2021-05-18,investing,"""The government"" doesn't necessarily mean they're getting anyone who knows what they're doing to actually do the running of the company. 

Zimbabwe got rid of farmers who had generations of farming knowledge. The government gave the land to people who had no clue about how to run a farm, and then people started starving in what was once called the bread basket of Africa. 

The government won't dismantle the mine, but they may well appropriate their vehicles to some nonsensical endeavor somewhere else. Like: If some politician's nephew wants to try out a truffle farm and decides that trucks are needed, those trucks will be taken from wherever they're available, and if that's a nickel mine - so be it. This example may well happen even without nepotism. If the government decides that nickel isn't what is going to get produced, then the mine will shut down and workers and equipment will be moved somewhere else.

""As long as something can be produced there will be profits"" - this is nonsensical. If that were the case, there would not be a single unprofitable venture anywhere. Just because something is produced, doesn't mean someone will want it enough to exchange something else of value for it.

People run businesses and operations. It seems like you think every operator of any venture is interchangeable, but we have ample evidence that this isn't the case. Farmers in Zimbabwe either know how to run a farm, or they don't. Mining experts either know how to run a mine or they don't.

In that case, it makes sense to outsource the running of the mine to foreign companies. Those are foreign investments by the way - money is coming into the country from abroad in the form of an investment, and those investments pay for the local labor. On top of that, the government taxes the profits from the mine. 

If by ""extraction"" you mean that natural resources are being extracted - well, that's exactly right. I've always found it fascinating how people, especially left-leaning self-proclaimed environmentalists, demand electrification due to it being more climate-friendly, but when you ask them if they'd allow for extracting battery metals, ten times out of ten they say: ""No, you shouldn't build that mine.""

So my question is, naturally, who is going to do without electrification since we need battery and other metals to do the electrification, but if we're not allowed to extract them, that means that everyone will not benefit from electrification and they will thus have to power their society using fossil fuels. 

So left-leaning environmentalists demand something they're absolutely not willing to allow to happen, just so that they can look down on people who they themselves force to use fossil fuels.

1122,2021-05-18,investing,"> ""when fed legalization comes up they'll SOAR""

I wouldn't be so sure. There are two analogous situations I can think of where investors expected stocks to soar after legalization: alcohol stocks at the end of Prohibition, and Canadian marijuana stocks upon legalization. In both cases, the anticipation overshot reality, and it turned out that there wasn't a secret horde of consumers who desired alcohol or cannabis, but had been too worried about legal ramifications to consume; in both cases, black market supply chains continued uninterrupted, reducing the number of retail consumers, but there also turned out to just not be a huge untapped market. Everyone overestimated how many people consumed those products.

Once companies started generating legal revenues and publishing actual numbers instead of just fantasies, stock prices came crashing down hard. On top of lower revenues than anticipated, a lot of the companies weren't run very efficiently and were consistently losing money. 

Buying into a stock in the hopes that an illegal substance will someday become legal is pure speculation. Guessing which stocks in that industry will have solid financial performance after legalization may happen at some point in the future is, in my opinion, like throwing a pair of dice on a roulette wheel and hoping that they land as a seven on 00.",gyj25eq,t1_gyivajc,[],0

They've been private for the last 9 years.  Based on their reporting over the last 2 quarters theyve generated over $3B this year alone.  Sure, they profit from volume. which is why they are adding more assets, they also profit from custodial services and institutional buying.  They have a venture capital arm, they are now offering crypto based loans, stakng, payments, defi and other services.  Coinbase is more than just an exchange.

> And btw, that’s still a really high fee if you’re trading large sums. Plus they are taking the premium on the bid/ask spread.

It's a high fee, but I choose to accept the premium based on the service they offer.  They provide me more options than other exchange services offering crypto for sale.  Sure, competition is coming but even the ""free trading"" movement isn't truly free because you become the product not the customer as we see with Robnhood.  The breadth of services Coinbase offers, the ease of use for on ramping to crypto and the fact they have a great reputation and are a publicly traded company make them an appealing place to do business.  The competition that might be coming in coming may ironically be enabled by Coinbase providing crypto trading and custodial services to other major brokerages.

> I don’t foresee crypto ever being an actual medium of payment for physical assets unless it is pegged to a real currency. Too much volatility. Maybe that eventually goes away, who knows. But gold and silver have never stopped being volatile, and I see them as physical equivalents. A currency which is backed by nothing other than sentiment is subject to wild swings.

It already is.  Billions of dollars transact in dollar based stablecons every sngle day.  And not to burst your bubble but all currencies are volatile and thats why theres people who trade on FOREX.  The US dollar in particular is inflating at a higher than expected rate, causing investors to chase yields in an overinflating speculative stock market bubble.  Bitcoin and crypto can exist and be pegged to whatever localized value is required at the point of sale.  It's just another method of exchanging value, like the tokenized assets we trade on the stock market.  Bitcoin is more lke gold, it's got a finite supply, true digital scarcity and the bitcoin blockchain is the most secure vault in the world, that's available 24/7, around the world, and is liquid across almost every fiat and crypto asset in existence.  It's deflationary properties make it a better place to store wealth as more gold and silver could be found.  It's a currency backed by the aggregated hash power of the bitcoin network and electricity.  It has created an entire infrastructure from scratch and allows technological innovation in banking and finance that is just as revolutionary as the internet was to communications.  

Crypto does have bull and bear markets but here we are again blowing away your expectations for what is possible except this time we have companies going public, visa and mastercard announcing support for crypto payments, paypal offering them to users and major financial institutions hiring engineers and building out departments.  

Jamie Dimon calls it the biggest competitive threat his industry will face over the next 10 years.  Because imagine Facebooks cryptocurrency, which is backed by nothing, being introduced to their network.  Where Facebook pays users for participation or to receive advertising.  Where those 2.8B users can now use those Facebucks to buy things on Facebook, either through Facebook Marketplace with 800m users transacting in 70 different countries every month or 2.8B users around the globe being offered financial services by Facebook.  Facebook could become the biggest financial institution on the planet just by employing cryptocurrency in a very targeted way.  That's what makes Jamie Dimon wake up in a cold sweat because he only has 55M digital banking customers and crypto makes it possible for Big Tech to offer the same kind of services to investors large or small that JP Morgan and other banks offer only to the very wealthy.

And brokerages and other assorted middleman?  They can be cut right out of the picture with this technology.  Hate crypto all you want, but if it can save a company billions in costs you better believe they are going to find a way to use it to their competitive advantage.  Crypto isn't some flash in the pan, its the next logical extension of the internet and its coming for the finance and banking industry.

Coinbase is one of the best positioned companies in this space and already has investments in many of these projects that can revolutionize finance.  They will even be part of the discussion when it comes to regulations on the space.

Tesla is valued as if they’ll have a monopoly on not just electric cars but all passenger vehicles for the next decade at least. That, or people are doing the math and discounting Tesla stock as if it’s a much safer place to keep their money than cash. It makes absolutely no sense unless some truly unbelievable things happen. We can argue about what the things are or how realistic some might be, but for Tesla to be valued even at its current price in 10 years things need to go insanely well for the company.

I get why people like the company generally but IMO people have bid the stock price up to a level where even though the company is solid it’s unimaginable to me that shareholders are going to make anything other than speculative profit for quite some time.

Getting back to Amazon, hypothetically let’s say that once Bezos steps down they decide to not ever grow again and just pay a dividend. Suddenly I think the stock would look pretty attractive - obviously they’re not going to do that, but in a way the focus on growth *is* the dividend. Point being that intentionally having a low EPS in order to grow the business faster and having that make your P/E high (what Amazon does) is a lot different than the price being astronomical based on hype and unreasonable speculation and having that make your P/E high.

Just my $0.02 as some Schmuck on the internet.

TL;DR: I think it’s unfair to compare Amazon to Tesla, because Amazon’s P/E is high because E is intentionally low, whereas Tesla’s is high because P is high to the point of absurdity.",gyjalsd,t1_gyhvw04,['TSLA'],0

Wow, good call. I guess if you hit a bullseye after a million tries you can call yourself skilled. 

What's ""controversial"" is the contention in your original post that the timing of the pullback was so obvious, while also saying getting it right is luck. A pullback from an ATH is obvious? Well then, it's not really broken clock lucky guess to figure that out is it? Of course, if you had figured it out, maybe you could have made millions like Burry.

>Burry has been saying Tesla is overvalued for years, so it's not like he all of a sudden came to the conclusion to short.

No, he hasn't. Tesla's massive run up was mostly over the last year, so that doesn't really add up. As far as I can recall, he first announced he was bearish on Tesla in December. And evidently, he made his bet against in in Q1, at or around the time it hit his all time high. Considering the fall since then, he's undoubtedly made a lot of money, so pretty smart move. Which again, if it was so obvious, why didn't you do the same?

>He also believes the entire market is going to crash again soon and has been saying so for years. At some point, he's going to be right just like a broken clock.

You can't really do that when it comes to shorting, since you will lose a ton of money keeping a failing short position open, or at the very least, eat a lot of put option premiums.

1275,2021-05-18,investing,"In terms of revenue, sure I guess we can put that question aside. But the question is how much revenue is generated outside of the last two or three quarters aka, a normal year. Not the last two quarters. 

Coinbase generates what like 92% or something of revenue from transactions? The other services you mentioned are basic things that a bank does. When they have assets to borrow against, they can do that. Like I said, I’m not short coin so I am not completely familiar with all of their financials and how many assets they have to borrow against. Servicing institutions will never be a large driver of revenue. The transactions are too few and far between. 

On fees, 0.5% remains high. That’s a 50 dollar fee for a 10k transaction. Even if you charged twenty dollars for a trade, as brokers did back in the day, it would be much cheaper. 0.5% is really high. And the vast majority of people on coinbase are paying a much higher fee. But hey, when the money is flowing, who cares about a paltry percent or two. It just keeps on going up baby. 

The second argument for saying coinbase, as a company, has value is that they are a leader in the crypto currency space. 

The technology appears to have promise, but much like the dotcom bubble, crypto currencies have exponentially increased in price based on pure speculation. 

Coinbase is the poster child for this speculation. They have no claim on the blockchain technology, and what they do is not and cannot be unique. If brokerages and middlemen are to be cutout, then Coinbase would be to, because they are the middle man. Robinhood likely does crypto volume which is many multiples of coinbase. But coinbase makes more money because of fees. And coinbase charges the big institutions fractions of what they charge little guys. Go figure. They are valued as a $50b company serving a market that is only ~2 trillion usd. That’s insane. They are only an intermediary. 

In terms of cryptocurrency, I think that some might have value after the speculative fervor subsides, but it’s hard to know which ones. I am of the opinion that Bitcoin will go to zero. 

Bitcoin has no value other than what others are willing to pay for it. This is obvious. Bitcoin especially is a lousy argument to say that blockchain technology is more efficient than any other current payment system. It consumes an insane amount of energy. Saying something is finite is irrelevant and does not make it true. If something can be forked, how does that make it finite? 

There are other blockchains, like ethereum, which seem to be useful. But I don’t think your argument talks about network effects of a blockchain. How does having more users increase the value of a network? 

FOREX is not volatile with respect to Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. That’s simply untrue. While it may be volatile in some respects, inflation of the USD has averaged 2% or less for the last ten years. Inflation of the USD is done on purpose by a central monetary system.

Crypto currency networks are promising in that a currency is created. But really, it’s the blockchain technology behind it that has the value. Currencies must be supported by a government in order to have long lasting value. That’s how modern civilizations work. The currencies are supported by the governments. If a government collapses, so will the currency. The US is nowhere close to that. Any currency which is backed only by the lack of faith in civilization will forever be volatile. Gold is the case and point here. It goes up during times of fear. The case is made again and again about the value of gold as countries collapse. It’s an age-old cycle. 

If Jamie Dimon were losing sleep over zuckbucks, he wouldn’t be the CEO of the biggest bank in the United States. They are developing blockchain technology. But it’ll be a while, and at this point it doesn’t seem like it’s better than current solutions.",gyjg1d3,t1_gyj6xty,[],0
