This is below the 100-kilometer altitude of the Karman Line, which is commonly used as a standard, although not official, boundary of space. The F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI), the world air sports federation that maintains records for both aviation and spaceflight, said in November that it planned to reconsider the altitude of the Karman Line, suggesting it might be moved down to 80 kilometers.

USUALLY the FDA would pull any drug or product (including vaccines) after just 50 deaths being reported. Why have they not pulled these vaccines?

The FDA hasn't even done most of the appropriate safety checks yet and says so on their website. What about the long term side effects? Death post vaccination is a short term effect. Who knows what will happen in a year or ten to those who did live. 

I hate to say it but OP isn't lying, a fear monger, or some conspiracy nut.

 And there is no ""monopoly"" threat to worry the regulators -  NVIDEA and ARM have different specialist fields. This is not one specialist that becomes twice as big so it crushes the competitors.. it is the creation of a new field.

It is perfectly possible that I am totally wrong.. but only existing competitors (of either company) will object.. but no one competes on both sides of the NVIDEA/ARM combo.. so their competition will not be crushed by a monopoly any more than it is now - all they can object to, (which ever of the 2 is their own field)  is to a competitor in that field, that is at present bigger than they are?   How will that change ?

just my opinion.. but this is NVIDEA mutating into something that doesn't exist. As it did when it first invented the idea and developed the future of GPUs.

It doesn't benchmark itself on the previous year but on  supply, demand and production costs as most consumer goods do. When bottle necks are resolved, supply goes up driving prices down. Since the majority of the current inflation is due to these factors I expect it to be transitory. I also do not believe that other countries will stop buying USD.

550,gz30i34,2021-05-22,t1_gz2po76,wallstreetbets,"The reason people are freaking out over here inflation is pretty simple. Think of the USD as an equation of goods. As the dollar becomes less good, it takes more USD to receive goods.

Take a look at the S&P 500. It‚Äôs currently sitting at 418. Why is it up after a year of lockdowns? We‚Äôre up 30%+, yet most companies have been hit hard. Most are on government life support with the insane amount of spending our government has done. A third of all currency in circulation was created within the past 13 months. The true value of the dollar has dropped more than the S&P 500 companies.

Between February 2020-2021 we‚Äôve only seen a 3% in the CPI, yet goods such as steel and corn are up 90%+. We‚Äôve cut production, yet demands are going higher and the CPI doesn‚Äôt reflect it. We have more money competing for less goods. Inflation has specifically hit stocks, crypto, and the components of goods.

The USD is considered too big to fail since it is an equation for goods globally versus domestically. Inflation is expected to suppress once we open up from the pandemic.

The issue now is when taking a look at the reverse repo market, things are looking worse than the FED let‚Äôs on. In September 2019 we had a 10% spike in the reverse repo market. The FED has been doing ‚ÄúNot QE‚Äù to lower rates with printed money. Repo rates skyrocketed because there was a need for liquidity back in 2019 to cover short positions. We now have the issue of rehypothecated treasuries being used as collateral to receive more funding from the banks, which increases interest rates more and creates a feedback loop of needing more collateral that‚Äôs being backed with bad treasuries. We‚Äôre now to the point that the USD is inflated to the point there is more demand for collateral than cash. 

We‚Äôre to the point where a massive margin could cause a liquidity crisis.

At some point maximum production is reached and only prices will rise thus an economic crisis and rising of the interest rates. This will make production capacity be destroyed as de-investments or bankruptcy so the cycle can start over. I know of two other systems in the world one is in north korea and the other in cuba.

Not possible. What upgrades do you propose haha. I cannot think of a worse design. They would need to throw everything out and start over. And they have little to no talent, they are still using Burt Rutan's designs.    


Airframe needs to go. So fragile it disintegrated from suborbital stresses. So fragile the windows are tiny to avoid breaking it. 

Needs a real engine. (Rocket Motor 2 is a disposable hybrid engine. Similar to a very very old school SRB.) Cannot be upgraded for much more efficiency or Dv. Needs completely new engines and a new airframe to hold the tanks. 

Needs a heat shield and new material. It's carbon composite. When it gets hot it retains the heat and the resin will get soft. Meaning that the ship will have a bad day coming back. 

Needs a real rocket to get into orbit. (SpaceShip 2 is 18 meters, Falcon 9 is 63.)

&#x200B;

New Shepard on the other hand will have it's engines stolen for New Glenn's upper stage. A real rocket.

it's not worth it. Robinhood does worst fills and they pocket the difference, so you will instantly lose about 3-5% your account value every time you make a trade.

To put it into perspective. I placed a $5k bet on MSTR put, and fidelity did a price improvement of $170 dollars. If I used robinhood, they would have kept that $170 for themselves.

Even if you put a limit order, it doesn't matter. Say you want to buy a put for $3.50 and it will never fill at that price until price fluctuates down to $3.45. Then citadel buys it for $3.45 and then sells it to you for $3.50. Limit order doesn't mean anything when they can wait on filling your orders.",[],0

My friend, Wikipedia, tells me that an exhaustive 2017 Treasury Inspector General report found that from 2004 to 2013 the IRS used both liberal and conservative key words to identify 501c(4) entities for further scrutiny. James Comey told Fox in 2014 investigations continued though no evidence of ""enemy hunting"" had been found. 2015 justice department said no criminal charges would be filed, 2017 Trump administration declined to reopen the case against Lerner, Even though the Trump administration settled 400 cases with conservative groups that claimed they were unfairly targeted. 

2013 is when this started going down. Citizen's United decided in 2010. 501c(4) entities doubled year on year next 2 years. 

Obama asked for additional 1B IRS finding, Republican Congress instead cut the budget, and reduced IRS start 6% through early retirement buyouts.

My take is that when Federal agencies fuck up, they get called out.

You can make more money having your movie play at theaters and getting $ per person that watches vs someone owning a stream and letting someone else use their password and watching the new movie on that. yes your getting views with streams but your not returning as much money that way. Netflix alone reported they would have 50% more streamers if people didn‚Äôt share accounts over 6 months or a year ago.

Yeah an ETF could work but do you have control over what to buy and sell to ensure you make money that is untaxable?

I was thinking of a basket of investments from which you live off the growth but pay no taxes on selling the growth for cash. So in my example, you sell off 600k of Google, 400k of Tesla, then buy two new stocks for 500k and 400k.

I'd have 100k in cash that year, my stock portfolio would be the same $1.5m as earlier with a different distribution. It would effectively be as if I sold 100k of Google stock but paid no taxes.

The announcements should at least bring it back to the pre-Driftwood speculative price that was pre-COVID. 

Being that this will have some initial big moves and climb over 5+ years means I'll probably keep investing. Who needs VTI when in 5 years you can have 2,000%+.

Also, the sells you have seen have been very small and only come as the execs have acquired more stock. Makes sense if they need a little something to live off of if that's their compensation. Someone on the board recently also added another 100,000shares. Insider ownership is at 32% and institutional ownership is buying more and more.

If you have a single wrinkle on your brain then use whichever you prefer. There are so many stocks out that staring at a chart is not an optimal strategy.

It is world reserve currency.  It does not behave like money and hasn‚Äôt since it has gone off the gold standard‚Äîwhose price has risen exponentially.  

There is no inflation coming.  There is zero lower bound coming.  

Money died in 1933.  FDR and the fascist state killed it in order to fuse capital and labor together again (‚ÄúKeynesianism‚Äù). What we have today is worthless scrip.  And that‚Äôs the point: valueless tokens expressing valueless labor.",[],0

Quite frankly the stock market isn‚Äôt built for the type of gain we would‚Äôve seen had they not shut it down so I see why they did it (as unfair and stupid as it was). After that the retarded apes running the hedge funds shorted the shorts on GME (a term called naked shorting since you‚Äôre autistic as hell). And now we wait for 1 of three possibilities: 
1. Naked shorts get margin called
2. On 6/8 GME turns over awesome earnings and then the following day (6/9 since you‚Äôre retarded) at the board meeting the board announces a share recall to boost their treasury. 
3. Apes keep buying and holding until some other catalyst comes along. 

All it takes is for something to happen that causes all of the short and naked short positions to be unwound. You wanna talk to me about fundamentals I‚Äôd recommend two things:

1. Become a licensed financial advisor (pass your SIE, Series 7, and Series 66 since you prob don‚Äôt know what that means either).

You're bashing all of TA based on this one indicator while pointing out only cases where it ""didn't work"". 


You're  bragging about your strat saying that it ""won"" 89% of the time but you don't elaborate or give any proof. (The pnl posted just shows your top winners and not of this 89% win rate you claim this last week. Also what's the win rate over a longer time period? Like over a year?) 


If you have a working strat and it's working great for you then congrats. Why do you feel the need to bash TA just because you're not using it? If you truly believe that TA doesn't work and the point of this post is to discourage other people from using it cuz it's bs, then why not elaborate on your own strat and explain how it's better than TA strats?

Bread hasn't gone up that much...""yay!"" but a huge number of Americans have found themselves completely priced out of the housing market, which is doubly exacerbated by the fact that so many of them have insane amounts of student loan debt holding them back. God forbid you get really sick or have a persistent or unusual illness...then it's just game over financially.

I guess my feeling is that everybody was scared shitless about hyperinflation after 2008 but it ""never came"" (except it did, just in disguise) but nothing bad happened either way...we had one of the biggest bull runs in history and continue to hit new ATHs regularly. We've been printing the whole time with only a couple half-hearted attempts at dialing things back.

A conventional solid propellant rocket launched at ~50mi altitude, which the plane's already proven capable of, could easily get more than 660 lb to LEO.

Do yourself a favor and watch Martin Shkreli's YouTube classes on modeling AAPL. I have been modeling several fintech companies like this since 2016 (PYPL, V, MA, DFS, AXP, SQ). 

Even if you give SQ a discounted cash flow of 1.5% (basically saying their business is as secure as the US treasury bond), their price per share should top out at $182. Nevermind the fact that their competition (venmo, clover) have been slowly pressuring the market since q4 2019. If you assign them a moderate risk of 4% (around the same as AMD), they are worth $158 per share.

I know its easy to believe the story that all tech has been significantly beaten up already, and its time for the NASDAQ to rebound. But even if that's true, the ones that fly highest see the hardest correction, and SQ has been stuck in this sideways channel for the last quarter. It hasn't seen a real correction from its January high (which was an astronomical 24% gain in 3 months).

I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble ****ting.

No, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my butt-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my buttcheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling. Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can't-Be-Flushed threshold.

I was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. ""Hey! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!"" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. ""How many Indians could there be?"" said by General Custer. ""Looks like a good day for a drive!"" by JFK. ""There! America On-Line now has complete Usenet access!"" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.

I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my butt of hair. Occasionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My butt was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.

Little did I know.

I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two buttcheaks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.

Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic poo- molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky ****/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.

Unfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my butt off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering ****/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my butt cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own ****blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: ""It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.""

Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my butt at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for butt-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my buttcheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.

As if that wasn't enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your butt having the texture of a Brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.

Guys, DON'T SHAVE YOUR BUTT-HAIR!",[],0

increasing demand for x is going to drive the price up.  you limit demand in the private sector by increasing interest rates making starting new business or taking loans a non option. you then remove the assets from the feds balance sheet.

1. Which chart? Daily or weekly or something in between or monthly?
2. 15, 30, 1 and 4 that's 4 different chart. Which one and what determines which one? Also, at 10:00 am or at 11:00 am you do not really have a 1 or 4 hour chart respectively. Also, which MA? 20? 60? 100? 200? See there are length of time your plot is showing data, there are frequency, there are variation in MA settings. None of the books I read says anything about the anything definitely. You can use a 20-day or a 60-day or a 100-day to find support or resistance. That's a hell lot of combinations. If you tell people these are the options you have and now try and see which one works for you, it's not a good advice. Because one day one set up may hit but there is no guaranty that will hit gain on the same stock next day or next month or another stock. That's the problem with TA.  
3. 1,5 minutes to time exit. So are you holding for 1 to 5 minutes? What if SP doesn't move much in that time frame? What if you are in loss but not big enough to hit stop loss trigger? What if you are at loss only 5% after entering the position and SP moves slowly but under your entry point for 2 hours and theta is burning?

Dont invest (gamble) more than you can lose.  My gut feeling (y'all can quote that on your next DD on anything), is it will reach a bit below the previous ath.  I would love for it to fly, but it seems actual (not us)  investors are over the SPAC craze, and a bit hesitant in the speculation of success.

Hell, Cathy (not a fan tbh) had timing on this company worse than when the Mongols invaded Japan. To be real, I think it would be hilarious if she fomo'd at a new ath, and holds thru correction.  

I 'like' the company (seriously though, that is the extent of my DD), but I have ridden it up and down for almost a year now harder than an only child in alabama rides his pillow at night (no sister to f).  ""If"" this pans out well though, I will excercise a few of the calls and sell CC's on them during the correction.

tl/dr:  You do you, but dont do to your account what I do on a semi monthly basis.  I would probably be up hundreds of thousands if I worked on my pullout game, which is why I am closing about a quarter of the contracts a bit after open Monday.  Baby steps!",[],0

2. The 15m on up usually default to at least 5d of info on most platforms. In my style I use the MAs along with support resistance lines I draw or fib lines. If it crosses over a line and a ma is coming up fast, I‚Äôll bail off I got my minimum PT or start to trim. Reverse with SL. It also helps to be tracking volume and obv or BBS or whatever else they can start to give an indication of momentum slowing. 

0DTE are extremely tricky and no one I know has a provable high success rate with them. 1dte atm are a bit easier if you can catch the low/high of the day since you have another day for it you to be right and have to little time cushion yet. 

But yes everyday you should update your chart to account for the prior days price action if day trading. Longer term you don‚Äôt need to as often, especially if it‚Äôs just trading sideways or there‚Äôs a big move. 

3. Holds times depend on market actions and price movement. Options I‚Äôll hold for as little as 5 min some times on stuff like tsla, but indexes or say AMD might take a few hours. Once I‚Äôm in though is back to 1. and following the action. 

Everyday is different and no strategy works everyday all the time. Need to have a few different set ups with different indicators and ta lines ready imo.

While DKNG engages in daily fantasy, which other major books don't, I'd argue that for most serious bettors, apps like betMGM which come with an extremely well known betting brand.

DKNG will need to up it's tech investment, e.g. by committing to being a partner or owner of FuboTV (bringing DKNG's sizeable existing audience to FUBO's unique value prop), or risk losing edge. (MGM for example has captured Yahoo as a partner, which has a significant Fantasy Sports presence).

[This article](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/45871/us-sports-betting-race-for-third/) while acknowledging the lead for DKNG, has a lot of information suggesting that there's going to be further division of the online sports betting market.

That said, given that legalization is spreading, the entire market is going to grow by so much, higher price targets across the board for all involved major players is probably a viable option.

TLDR: life was fucked, sucks less now, thanks a lot, made some art that I spent a lot of time and energy on, letting you retards pick what to write across the front of it. 

Yo I just wanted to give a quick thanks to nobody in particular. Big love to everybody here. Sorry for the sappy post but giving you guys a shoutout is the only reason I made this account.

 I feel pretty silly saying it since I have barely posted here so far, but this subreddit has made a seriously positive impact on my life and the appreciation I have for you all is real. I started reading through WSB years ago because I caught notice of some totally batshit memes and loss porn floating out of here. I understood less than half of them, but I wanted to know more. Only had a vaguest of ideas of what stocks were. 

&#x200B;

I started looking into finance, because back in the day I watched some dude guh his way though a life savings worth of dough in literally seconds. It was some of the craziest shit I'd ever seen, but I had to read 'investing for dipshits' to even understand what the fuck it was I watched. I know when I see something fantastic and stupid, but I was too financially illiterate to fully grasp just how crazy you fucks actually are. It's like I stumbled upon an oasis of mytical idiots and couldn't comprehend the words in the siren's song even though I knew I had to get closer. 

This type of shit is genuinely the last thing I ever expected to have an interest in. But out of the curiosity for the memes came a lot of reading, and from that reading I gained exposure to a basic financial education that I'd somehow missed out on as an adult.. I barely knew how to write a damn budget. It actually blows my mind how much I didn't know and how much has changed just because I looked a few things up from a meme I couldn't understand. I've been able to get my shit together in pretty significant ways, so again thank you guys a lot for just doin what you do.

&#x200B;

The past decade or so has been pretty rough and I wasn't really been sure where I was heading. I've become certain over the past couple years that I want to use my GI bill to get an education in finance so I can formally help dumbfucks like me learn how to start saving for retirement (so they have an IRA to yolo on dumbshit when the time comes), and hopefully break some of the generational bullshit surrounding money in my own family. 

&#x200B;

 I've been working on this thing since late February. It's pretty sizable, about 2 feet in diameter. I would have been done a lot sooner but I don't really know how to carve or paint. I got the piece of wood plus a couple carving chisels from home depot and used an acrylic paint set I got for christmas to color it. 

You may notice that the banner/scroll on the right of the coin is blank. The WSB community has played such a big role in my positive transformation over the past few years that I think it's only right that you all put the finishing touch on this thing before I hang it in my office.

Many moons a-go during the depression people disassembled entire ghost towns to build their new home in the nearby larger town. Mining camps from the gold rush, and cattle stops from the Midwest were dissembled and used to build homes and outbuildings because the cost of goods and transportation of those good were too expensive then. Oh, coming to a theater near you in a decade or so. 

What caused this was at the end of the roaring 20s right before the margin bubble burst, the Govt. had issued tariffs (Smoot\_hawley act) on many soft commodities because use was so high but demand fell and prices still needed to be high (visibly) this was done under the guise of Nationalism. Shit fell apart anyways, we tried even deeper nationalistic legislation to no avail.

As we try this similar legislation, it is just to deflect the deflation that will hit the lumber market soon. All those orders to fill, placed 6 months to a year out, and we are already seeing the napalm hitting the fan. (I love the smell of ON/repo markets in the morning)

OP confuses money, especially commodity money, with the dollar‚Äîvalueless fiat currency.  They do not behave the same, and the dollar has not behaved the same since its decoupling from gold.

A pattern that our brain can relate to something familiar so that we know beforehand whether it's safe or danger. 

Now, ""It doesn't always work"" point. If I give you a stock chart let's say a 3 months chart of SPY. You can create at least 30 different charts from that same chart just buy changing the parameters such as duration, frequency of the SP and indicators as well. They all will look different.

Now from that 30 different chart you can find pattern like X-day SMMA is acting as support and Y-day SMMA is acting as resistance in a few charts. But in other chart you will see that those support and resistance lines are not acting as support and resistance at all.

Now if you create the same 30 charts using a different ETF or stocks, you might find that pattern in some chart and not in majority of otherers. 

One configuration in one chart of that SPY that shows the support and resistance is no longer valid in other ETF or stocks. 

Now if you take a 6 months chart and redo everything you will get even more random hit and miss. 

Stock or ETF or whatever the financial instruments doesn't obey or follow a predefined line such as a moving average line. The movement is inherently random but could take a directional move based on many many factors that no one in this earth has control over. Now, if you do not have control over something in a short term you can not really predict the movement with any confidence at all.

You can make speculative guess based on surrounding economic, political, weather, company financial, earning reports etc. but that speculation is not for day trading. 

You can observe RSI and might think that well it's over bought and then you buy puts only to see that SP keeps going u. SP might drop slightly gradually and RSI might go down to 30 but it could still be a price above your entry. Which means your puts are not doing well.

Also having a inflation rate that it self is inflating is a sign things were heading in that direction. the US went from 4% to 15% with the rate of inflation increasing....the US went into a major recession to stop inflation by having 20% interest rates.

your claim that it can only happen if the country is having an issue if there is a war or lost production or one item is false as you can cause massive hyper inflation with just bad monetary policy but most countries are not ran by retards that will inflate their asset values away.

also most countries got into hyperinflation by printing money to pay their debts. This eventually caused a feed back loop resulting in them having to reissue new currency...  

my economic professor dealing with global markets was from Argentina. he had a few words about his countries economic policy seeing as they had to issue a new currency that also failed. 

A 10% inflation rate means inflation would be 500% or 5 times above target inflation rate of 2%.

First off, let me just point out that economists actually do not agree on how to measure inflation. No, ""more money printed"" is not inflation. No, ""more money velocity"" is not inflation. No, ""price of gas/milk/homes/[other specific commodity] is going up"" is not inflation. It's a mixture of all of these, weighted somewhat arbitrarily, and almost all think tanks have their own metric on measuring it. Even looking at the government's metric for inflation isn't perfect, as a 10% spike in used car prices is contributing to most of the scary inflation value coming out of April.

Inflation going back to ancient history is also slightly misguided, as inflation is specifically tied to fiat currency and not to goods in general. More animal skins to trade is not akin to economic principle of inflation; animal skins have a base use value as a commodity, not exclusively as a currency, so their being devalued is a supply increase, distinctly different from inflation. The coins example from Rome is better, but fraudulent coins and government crackdowns on that area are a better indicator of the loss of value than simply more in circulation.

Germany ~1920 did experience hyperinflation, and the cause is aptly described with the Treaty of Versailles debt (every country printed money for war; it was not the unique causative factor). The lessons learned are not accurate though. Money does not need some standard backing to be valuable: the US dollar is the world reserve currency because of trust and faith in the US' ability to honor that obligation, or, in other words, the US is the world's hegemon and declared its currency is super valuable and nobody had the balls to tell us we're wrong in the face of our massive military. In fact, it is entirely necessary for any sovereign country's currency - if it wants a sound economic policy - to NOT have a tangible backing, so that under a crisis such as a pandemic, they can inject cash into the system to prop it up (this was the biggest lesson of the 2008 financial crisis).

So now we get to the argument of why inflation will rise, and none is convincing. Yes, we printed a lot of money this past year; yes, a good chunk of that money went into the hands of regular people. But as I stated above, none of this actually means inflation will be significantly high in the foreseeable future. More money is created by bank lending than federal reserve policy - significantly more. This is why the US is primarily considered a debt-driven economy: money I put in the bank is lent out to you who buys assets that goes into another person's bank which lends it out to someone else, so on and so forth, a multiplicative effect of spending ability stemming from my initial deposit. The fed printing dollars (or changing numbers on a spreadsheet to be exact) is no different, except that the Fed is doing it, not your local JP Morgan.

The thing is, the Federal Reserve historically does not often hit its 2% per year inflation goal, usually hovering around 1.8%. This means our economy could take a little higher inflation like 2.4% for a year or two and be fine. But even if 2021 hits 2.4% inflation or higher, it's still going to be marginally impactful because 2020 was a deflationary year! If you extrapolate our inflation from Feb 2019 to now, we're exactly where we would be without a pandemic: a ~1.9% YoY inflation level. We're not on the verge of a hyperinflation to 50%. We're not about to see the collapse of the American economy. We're not about to see gold prices spike to 5x overnight. We're just hitting a rough transitionary patch as we reel back the support spending and move into the normal economy.

TL;DR normal inflation relax your butthole

I grew up with the OG ninento, before that I had the commodore 64. My point is I go back, and so do my friends. I'm a computer science major, gamer, investor. So when my friends and I are talking about video games (for our whole lives) we talk about the future. and its typically about the industry having to change from console and cartridges to subscription based online content. The retail location to buy sell and trade consoles (just like a blockbuster) will die. But guess what? Blockbuster showed the world what happens when you let a redbox and netflix come in for your tendies. You die, quick and hard. 

So why will Gamestop survive? I haven't seen this analogy so forgive me if it's not constructed correctly as I'm doing this freehand... just ask Nintendo. 

Nintendo owned the video game landscape before playstation came in and then xbox afterwards (don't forget NeoGeo in there along with others). Everyone always thought Nintendo would eventually fall out, but look at. their history. They'll come out with Pokemon Go and their stock goes bananas. They come out with switch and they can't keep them in stock. 

My point is that Nintendo has a brand, a great upper mgmt, great vision and cult level customer base.

Gamestop has a brand, a great upper mgmt and cult level customer base. 

I am not ready to say that Gamestop has great vision, but I think that will come out after the annual meeting when RC takes the reigns and can fully enact his directive. But because of his history at Chewy I'd have to say that great vision is at least implied. They at least have a great visionary.

All those foreclosures would rank the housing market.

We are starting to feel the covid impacts on the supply chains and production. We see it with Lumber as builders scramble to build homes to meet the needs of the market and with chips as electronics are being purchased. I believe it was the auto industry that is being hit hard by the chip shortage. 

We are seeing these glimpses of hard hit sectors from the COVID shutdowns that cannot be ignored. 

Add in the unrest in the Middle East and Israel, the pipeline fiasco for the fuel and we have a lot of nervous investors. 

Something worth pointing out is the way information is dissemination these days. Stocks and market health was once a wait and see game. Folks would wait for the printed newspaper or the news update on television.  However, we are in the instant feedback realm with a new category of investors. The creation of the Robin Hood (and similar brands) investors have allowed the common person to create influence and noteworthy change.

I climbed out of these safe limbs
Ventured away
Walking tall, head high up and singing
I went to the city
Car horns, corners and the gritty
Now I am the proudest monkey you've ever seen
Monkey see, monkey do Then comes the day
Staring at myself I turn to question me
I wonder do I want the simple, simple life that I once lived in well

Second, I want to comment about the Dish rumors.  It will happen, Stanton Dodge (Chief Legal Officer of DraftKings) was Ergen's cheif  legal counsel at Dish for 21 years (linkedin is your freind).  This two are thick as theives. 

 Stanton's legal career  in CO is legendary with rumors dating back to Stanton sleeping in his car in the Dish parking lot when he started as an intern and who rose through the ranks to be Charlie Ergen's right hand legal guy.  All the Dish attorney's worked for him; so both companies have key relationships to strike a deal.   I'm very bullish on a deal being made,  and a big one at that.

Stock high was $74 and came back to earth...now at $44.63. It has attracted high short interest so perhaps Hedgies have been pushing the price down. A couple of weeks ago I day traded in the high  $30 and over $42. I do like the stock but they need a change in leadership.

Celebrity endorsements have been ineffective and expensive. Where has Michael Jordan been since they paid him to get on board last year?  Gisele? Special Advisor - just silly ...what has she done for sports but marry Brady and go on the field after a Super Bowl? Bad attempt to buy him but very likely he can‚Äôt get involved due to his NFL contracts. Oprah ? Really ? Is she a gambler? I cannot see her drawing a crowd. 

Say what you want about Portnoy but his COVID small business fund was brilliant and his day trading site was addictive for COVID captives ... they will spend money where ever he goes. Sports Bars love him as they are highly profitable gambling and drinking dens. Portnoy seems to be spending his time in NY and Florida to lobby the politicians as California, NY, and Florida are the last 3 big markets to chase for big revenue. Massachusetts is not a large market and their money is better spent elsewhere. That being said, exactly where is Robbins these days ?  GUI will see Portnoy creating waves in Nantucket this summer. 

I have never worked for DKNG but I have been a shareholder since they were a spac. Made nice $$ but disappointed with their expenses and leadership the past 6 months. Paying PR firms to post on Barron‚Äôs and Reddit is so obvious but I guess you know that already.
