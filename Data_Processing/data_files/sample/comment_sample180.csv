I'm new to investing in stocks, and would really appreciate your help.  
  
I keep hearing how the current market is likely to be overvalued and all signs are pointing to a bubble. Analysts are warning it could be worse DotCom bubble, etc, with companies propped up on stimulus money despite the troubles of Covid. Apparently Warren Buffet and others have all suggested we will soon see a bear market, but it's impossible to know whether that will be next week or 2030.  
  
With that in mind, my current strategy is value investing for a 1 to 2 year window. I'm looking for massively undervalued stocks (currently my main pick is VIAC) and putting my money there, with the idea that they will outperform the indexes when the dip happens in future.  
  
After the dip, I'd love to go long-term and buy the SNP, chuck in some AAPL and MSFT and some electric car ETFs, but I'm worried if I do that now the arse will fall out of this thing and I'll be left buying at the top of a collapsed market.

I don't think that anybody is wrong doing managed funds or index funds.  The way to wealth is long term with controlled behavior from yourself or an advisor/coach rather than the right stock or funds.


American Funds in general is like a grandfather ""managed"" account a lot more diversified usually.  Typically they stay 15% or under per industry and usually caps at around 5% in any companies holdings 


The other two funds are more tech oriented with a bit more aggressive management style.


While at any point the holdings of the funds might be similar my strategy is 50% diversified equity mutual fund that has a buy and hold strategy for a lot their holdings which allows for lower management fees (think of this as my index fund in a way)


The other 50% is a more actively managed fund that I am going to ""try"" to get higher returns on.  Though typically long term the buy and hold wins, if I am rebalancing every quarter I can try to move some of those more aggressive earnings to my American funds account. (this is my higher risk mutual fund that I am taking an extra 0.4% fee on hoping I can get a little extra return. Like my 68% last year on fagax and 30% on agthx.  Well worth the 0.4% that year.

Stocks don't move like barrels in a river. There's no way to react ahead of time to what's ahead (without insider information), because by the time you see it, everyone else has, and the price already reflects the effect. And selling every time after a crash is the best way to loose money long term.

>but at least there's a small chance that the manager could see it coming and reposition

Being able to see a crash coming would be an amazing ability, but not a single person in all of investment history has been able to predict all of them, while not making incorrect predictions about crashes that never happen (i.e. there are some people who predict a crash every few months, so of course they predicted all the crashes). If your fund manager ""sees a waterfall up ahead"", and repositions, maybe he got it right, and makes you money, maybe he gets it wrong, and looses you money. It's a toss up either way. The amount of crashes they avoid would be proportional to the amount of time they spend out of the market. If you want a low volatility, low return investment, there are indexes for just that.",[],0

Some general ""rules of thumb"" I use for leveraged ETF investing:

1.) Keep the leverage to well-diversified indices: S&P, Russell 2000, Midcap 400. Anything else (sector investing, for example) is a gambling due to idiosyncratic risk (factor risk, sector risk, etc.).

2.) Only bet money you can literally forget about. In a bad year, your holding might go down 80% or more. Most people can't stomach that and hold but you \*have to\* if you want to succeed long term with leveraged ETFs  
  
3.) Stick to **less** than 2.5x leverage for long term holding. I only do 2x for true long-term. Various academic papers have looked at the optimal amount of daily leverage for risk adjusted returns and once you cross the 2x-2.5x range you start to get worse returns over time because the volatility is too high. 

4.) Stay away from sector leveraged ETFs or 3x ETFs unless you're hedging or holding (relatively - weeks, *maybe* months) short term. The sector stuff I've already explained -the 3x leveraged indices can become unrecoverable (99% loss) if you get caught in a prolonged downturn. That's extremely unlikely with 2x but would have happened in some instances with 3x ETFs (TQQQ would have been wiped out by the dot-com bubble burst.",[],0

Economists =/= not investors. Not even close. 

>One 50% bad day might not happen but many red days will, each eroding your mlney until it's pointless.

Not how leveraged ETFs work. Almost all of them reset daily...and no bear market is made up of only red days. In fact, bear markets are significantly closer to 50/50 (as far as what % of days are red vs. green) than bull markets; they would have to be since markets go *up* over time. Case in point: the U.S. stock market has had 59% green days when you take into account *the last 145 years of data.* 

> A regular bear market lasts for months (!)

A regular bull market - you know, those things that happen before and after bear markets? - lasts *years* which more than makes up for the downturns.

> and each red day erases 2-5x your money depending on leverage. To even get back to 0 you'd need 4-10x upside!

I've only advocated for long term holding **2x leveraged well-diversified indices** in this thread, but nice strawman. 

>Just tell me how many leveraged ETFs do you find taht survived '08, the last real crash? Ah, Zero? 

Citation? Because the first two 2x leveraged ETFs I looked up, SSO and QLD, have been around since 2006 and performed very well if held since then (and through 2 sharp downturns). So I'd love to hear how you came up with ""zero"" as your answer since that's demonstrably false.  

Notably, barely any levered ETFs *existed* prior to 2005 (most of them only started in the last decade, before '08 even happened) but I'm sure given your deep, serious research you already knew that. 

>Let's look at all leveraged ETFs through history and see all went broke in the end. Almost as if it doesn't work over long periods of time. When you take a loss you need to get 2x more upside to get back to ground zero. With a leveraged fund you'll most likely bleed out before you get in green again.

I understand that your intuition lead you to believe that a 2x levered fund would ""most likely bleed out"" since they ""all went broke"" except when we look at [145 years of U.S. stock market data we can actually synthesize how a 2x levered, daily resetting ETF would perform.](http://ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php)

Spoiler alert: **over the entire history of the U.S. stock market, a 2x levered daily-resetting ETF would have failed exactly** **0 times** and produces a significantly better CAGR than an un-levered portfolio. In fact, we can see that this would also be the case with most major domestic & foreign indices (to varying degrees, sometimes the optimal leverage is closer to 1.5 or 3) with only the Nikkei as an exception.

I didn't go full inspector Clouseau, but I looked at the local dealers website and filtered for new inventory, there are three within the 50 mile range and two of them said they had 300 vehicles available and the other had 150.  I actually had errands to run in town so I took a slightly longer route and drove by the area where a bunch of dealerships are.  To my (possibly biased) eyes, it looked like the other brands had all their cars lined up along the road and a lot of unusually empty parking lot behind them (I hope my measly 28 shares wouldn't bias me too badly, but it's hard to avoid).  The Toyota and Lexus lots looked full.

I think this is a time to sell a car while inflation is in the news (people might expect to have to pay more next year) and interest rates are still low (and people may worry that they will go up).  The Brand that has what people want in stock may be an advantage.

&#x200B;

Medium term it's all about what people want to by.   I really don't want to throw shade at people who like pure BEVs.  I understand they have a lot of things going for them.  I do however agree with TM here that the infrastructure just doesn't support it as a mass market vehicle yet (American who only knows a portion of America so zero insight into the rest of the world).  Charging stations are few and far between, people could have them installed in a garage, but apartment dwellers are kind of out of luck, so are people who rent, and people who travel a lot for work.  I took a week vacation in Florida earlier this year, and neither the hotel in Jacksonville nor Coco beach had a charging station.  Also, when you do the math, to get a large portion of the country in a pure BEV would take something like more than doubling the electrical generation capacity and that takes many years, and for supplying a large number of chargers to a small area (like an apartment building parking lot) would require replacing the standard power lines with higher capacity high voltage power lines and (in America) there is a lot of resistance to putting up a high voltage power line new people.

&#x200B;

Anyway, (I'm not trying to throw shade) I think the key innovation is the plug in hybrid.  Much smaller battery (40 to 60 mile range) plus the nearly perfected Hybrid drivetrain that came from continuous improvements in the Prius.  The Plug in Hybrid is the perfect vehicle for a large percentage of people.  Most trips (work, school or grocery store and back) are within the range of the all electric mode, but zero range anxiety for a vacation or weekend trip.  Right now, Toyota has eight Hybrids, and two of the (Rav 4 and Prius) have a plug in hybrid available.  I think those will continue to expand and be very good sellers.

&#x200B;

The added benefit is the higher gas mileage of the HEVs and PHEVs, meaning the average fleet MPGs goes up and they buy fewer CAFE credits from TSLA improving their margins.  Did you see the Minivan is only sold as a Hybrid model (no standard engine available).

&#x200B;

Long term, I think they are capable of adapting to what the customers want and the BEV will be available when a significant portion of people want one.  That's my reason behind buying 28 shares and wishing it would quit going up so I could buy more.",[],1

I've now read it. The difference between Sharpe's argument and yours is that you talk about distributions while he talks about averages (or the expected value of distributions).

> From this, it follows (as the night from the day) that the return on the *average* actively managed dollar must equal the market return [an average].

To express what Sharpe says in notation:

WLOG I will summarize all of the weights in the active portfolios as the proportion b of dollars, and let a=1-b such that all dollars are represented by a+b.

R_p = R_m
R_m = aR_p + bR_a
a+b = 1

=>

R_m - aR_p = bR_a
R_p = R_m
a+b = 1

=>

(1-a)R_m = (1-a)R_a

=>

R_m = R_a

This is clearly correct.

But what I'm critizising is not Sharpe's claim, it's your claim, which is substantially different from Sharpe's.

But by not stating the assumptions that make the conclusion necessarily true, and do not make the argument that they must be equal.

Rather your argument states that given two (identical, as per the stated qualification being identical) distributions up to a negative term for the active distribution, necessarily have different means (in favor of the passive distribution).

While true, it is a different argument than Sharpe's.

Let me write how I read you argument with less words.

Let the market distribution be X_m, all investable securities. (Implied)

Assume X_p ~ X_m

Assume X_a ~ X_m - c

For some cost c > 0

Necessarily E[X_a] < E[X_p]

This is correct per definition, but not Sharpe's argument.

What I criticized about it, as I imagine you see yourself, is that the assumption that X_p ~ X_m - c is going to be hard to motivate.

People fall prey to all kinds of confirmation bias. Human like to buy, not sell. It's just a psychological fact. They suffer recency bias (as we've recently seen). Our brains look for patterns all the time and make them when they don't exist.

No they don't. Not in every window of time. If you have 135 years to wait, sure.

You might argue that ESG factors are not a good proxy for quality of management or that they lead to more resilient companies. I understand your point of view, and the choice of going fully diversified vs. some form of active selection (even if done via setting criteria in an index) is a matter of philosophy. I personally have put my faith in indices and passive investing for years. However, I believe that are perhaps seeing only a portion of the ESG approaches that are out there and that there are indeed ones that are not built on exclusions as much as a hypothesis about factors that will have an outsized influence on the development of industry sectors and companies.

If ESG has any risk or return upsides in a particular time, it is completely coincidental because they are not designed with that objective.  Underperforming consistently by design is completely consistent with the design of an ESG fund, but it is not consistent with that of any other fund.

I would say that an actively managed portfolio that attempts to get a better return or risk by choosing firms that have better governance or some other ESG-ish criteria is just a regular actively managed fund, not an ESG fund.

Real risk-free yields today are at -0.88% (interpolated 10-year tips). The historical average equity risk premium in the US had been 5.6%. This implies a 10-year expected real return to equities of 4.72%, which seems more reasonable to me.

That’s without going down the path of forecasting what the risk premium should be in the future. Models of equity risk premium and implied risk-aversion suggest that 5.6% ERP is too high. That risk premium would imply an exceptional level of risk aversion.

By default, that means that you view the ESG label primarily applies to funds that are intentionally NOT using ESG as a financial investment thesis (e.g., screened funds, etc.). 

I would say that distinction is not universally held and many people that I work with would call a fund that has a formal process for assessing ESG data points as part of the investment process would count as an ESG fund whether the analysis is with an eye to financial materiality or is with an eye to a ""morally superior"" portfolio. But I get your points and believe that we would describe similar choices, but have a difference in which terms we use to delineate them.

I also take your point that the regulation allows for ESG funds that are focused on a financial (investment) thesis and can demonstrate performance. This is a reasonable expectation in principle for any default funds. In practice, there are indeed funds out there which use ESG for a financial thesis and the burden of proof and liability implied by the regulations creates an unintended (or maybe intended) barrier that I think is a bit unreasonable. Taking my 401k as an example, it is chock full of actively managed funds that are clearly not fully diversified, carry comparatively higher expense ratios, and have no apparent logic for their inclusion. I would rather see the DoL fix the standards by which all actively managed funds are selected and the ESG problem that you are raising solves itself. I am not a fan of targeting those funds with a burden of proof while still allowing administrators to throw in alternative actively managed choices that are arguably not any better than the ESG options which are no longer available. If I am going to risk under-performance due to insufficient diversification by the fund manager, then I would rather that it is on a strategy of my choosing than on one of these expensive large-cap funds with snappy marketing patter about their superior insights yet underperforms the benchmark.

Remember, stocks are an immediate estimate of future earnings.  Stated more brodly, they are assets.  Assets which find ways to cut costs, improve margins, and customer experience tend to improve standard of living.

The way I explain stock growth, is to think of it as standard of living.  Imagine someone in 1525 England discovering we have the option to shower every day or read a newspaper.

That's more than Apple, Microsoft, Amazon combined. 3 companies which collectively have about $800 billion a year in revenue. Apple and Microsoft each make more profit in a year, than Tesla's total revenue. Each.

But sure, if you're privy to something that most people aren't, and $6,000 is the number - load up on $1,725 calls. Looking at Jan 2022, it's $3.10 (x100), $310 total and you'd make about $4,275 (x 100) = $427,500 in profit if it hits $6,000 by then.

This isn't realistic, this is several standard deviations out of the expected move. The market is pricing in a less than 1% shot of Tesla hitting $1,725 by then.

Deep out the money LEAPs are maximum leverage, but not maximum expected profit. Expected return is -99.X% on something like a $1,725 call. Now time for the boring stuff you probably expected from this sub - the expected return on the S&P 500 ($VOO or $SPY) is about 20% during a bull year, 10% average (also counting bear markets).

1) I don't ""expect"" as in sure thing, I do think the most likely outcome of the next 20 years will be similar to some 20 year period in the market, I'd take pretty much any of them over the alternative of not investing. 


I operate in the world of selling my best guess with confidence.  I used to sell speculation of ""well I'm not sure what the market will do, we hope it continues returning 8-10%""  Well tried to sell at least. 


I recently realized that if I try to get technical with it, the customer isn't interested because they are uncomfortable.  If I just use 8% for 7-14 years, 9% for 15-20, and 10% for 20+, I'm not being slimy in doing so.  If I'm wrong, we are most likely in a better spot then if I scared them out of not starting.  Of course I tell them past performance does not mean future results, but explain that it's my best guess proudly. 


2) active management performs better sometimes worse sometimes.  There are funds that have outperformed the market, there is recency bias, I'm not oblivious to the idea.  I'm not saying they will in the future, but it would also be just as I'll advised, and for an advisor like myself, illegal to say that index funds will outperform managed. The point is, we have no idea, a good, long term, low cost managed fund is not going to break your retirement.  See Agthx, long standing fund, good company, fund managers been there for years, reputable company.



Second, having an advisor makes sense if you include the human variable.  I consider myself more a coach then anything.  Investing money is easy, just buy equity.  Talking people off the ledge of fear selling is one of the things that makes good financial advisors worth it. Not everybody needs it, but you'd be surprised how many people do.  Fear of loss is a big deal, especially as you hit your 50s for most people.


I've sold annuities to people after telling them how it will likely underperform vs mutual funds long term.  Purely because they wanted the peace of mind of a floor.  It's so easy to assume that everybody is like ""us"" in this sub.  The bulk of people are not, they are scared to lose.  It isn't easy to get people to start investing for themselves.

Also, it pays to remember that future cash flows in a DCF calculation are non-linear with respect to discount rate -- those out-year future cash flows are reduced by high powers of the discount rate.  In this environment, where people are using very low discount rates (2%-4%) in their DCFs to justify the prices of these growth stocks, a small increase in the risk-free rate and a constant equity risk premium can increase the discount rate by 50%-100%, which much more than doubles the impact on the NPV if most cash flows are in the future.

Been investing in a target fund for my Roth for about 2 years but just now getting into the nitty gritty of investing. 

I’m (M) 25 in the US, I was previously employed but now unemployed to do grad school full time. I have a sizable emergency fund that I’ve built to cover monthly costs for a year, and am receiving unemployment benefits that are set to run out soon. I adjusted my emergency fund to be bigger than usual last year because of Covid. I plan on graduating next December and then hoping to get a high-paying wage job in a HCOL area in tech.
Aside from my emergency fund, I have been saving for my wedding, a new car, and a dog under different buckets in my Ally account. My main objectives are for growth since I don’t think I will be spending this money any time soon and ultimately my goal right now is set on finishing grad school. My partner pays for rent and we split other expenses that we share. I do not have any debts to pay and currently I just started investing in a taxable account in a balanced International and domestic index fund.

My question is, what should I do with the money that I have saved up for a new car, dog, wedding that is sitting in my savings account? I predict I’ll be getting married in about 2-5 years, getting a dog in about a year, and contributing to my partners car in about 2-5 years after we get married. I have a pretty high risk tolerance, if my investments go down, I stay the road and invest more or DCA over time. I don’t believe on paying for a down payment on a house in the next 5-7 years since we want to live overseas or in another state for about that time range.

I just have about 10k sitting in a savings account which I thought was smart before, but I feel like I’m missing out on growth and losing to inflation. My current attitude is to no longer contribute to my savings. I pay off my credit cards in full every two weeks and then put the rest to invest or treat myself or my family a little bit every month.

Am I making the right decisions with my money right now? Should I throw the 10k into index funds and just wait it out? I can always sell and withdraw from my taxable account if I desperately need to but I’m trying to avoid short term gains tax. 

What other options do I have? 

Thanks!!

Vast majority of my funds are passively managed. HSA is pretty aggressive (for index funds). Vanguard Total stock market, small cap index, total int'l stock market,  Explorer fund. I don't plan on touching this account until I'm 57 1/2. Unless it's an absolute emergency. Assuming I continue to invest the same amount monthly ($100) and the RoR continues at the 10yr average, my HSA will have over 300k in it by the time I retire. Triple tax advantaged. Could it be more with different avenues? Probably, but I'm also limiting my risk and paying ridiculously low fees.

I have a retirement fund through my job. I pay in 9.8% monthly, they match 101%. I can retire at about age 57 with an average of my last 5 years of salary for the rest of my life and get a fat check for any accrued PTO that I didn't use, to which there's no limit. I've had coworkers retire with an entire year's worth of personal days banked and they get written a check for essentially what amounts to a year's salary.

I also have a personal investment account through vanguard with most of my funds there in VFIFX.

As seen in march 2020, a massive crash and prompt recovery to all time highs with over valuations across the board.

Maybe the general population is now educated/aware/deluded enough to smash their money into equity as soon as there's a crash? I.e. better than holding cash.

Thus rendering a genuine, wealth devastating crash of 2008 moot, as a rebound is more likely than not.

What makes a bubble relevant to the average person is 1. If it bursts and they need that equity asap 2. if it doesn't keep following long term trends upwards and faith in the markets disappeared.

I.e. in my position where I'm happy to leave equity for years, I would welcome a crash for cheap entry points!

What would cause a bubble to be an issue is if massive drawdowns happened at once, calling into an issue the narrow ""exit"" of liquidity.

VXX holds roughly a 50/50 split of VIX futures expiring in the coming 2 months (ex: half expiring in May,  half in June,  near month gets rolled before it expires).

VIX is a volatility index.  Volatility is an abstract idea,  there's no way to take ownership in VIX directly. 

You can bet on the movement of VIX with futures,  or you can buy an ETF that tracks VIX futures. 

You're playing with a bunch of gamblers when you buy VIX futures of any sort.  They all want the market to crash and volatility to spike... and so they overpay for VIX futures.  Typically VIX doesn't move a whole lot.  Say it's at 20 today and in 1 month it's still 20. VIX futures today might price in a move to 22. You pay 22 today,  it's worth 20 in 1 month when the futures contract expires. You're down 10% even though the ""underlying"" is flat. 

Anything that directly tracks volatility has some sort of time premium built in - a premium due to tail risk of volatility spikes. 

If none of this makes sense,  I'd suggest spending a few hours researching what are options,  what are futures,  what is implied volatility,  theta,  what is VIX, read the VXX prospectus, etc.

Gold is always touted as a store of value, just remember that there are significant transaction costs and storage costs. 

Crypto on the other hand is divorced from direct connection to currencies but has no intrinsic value, so balance of probabilities is most will become worthless but.. they might not. Ethereum seems to be the one with the least speculation attached (and hence volatility), BTC itself is now effectively a store of value so it's probably the other best bet. A little in here.

Real estate retains value until it doesn't, everyone thinks property never drops, it does. Some here is good but try not to make it too much of the total.

Shares in businesses that will continue to be viable in a hyperinflation scenario are good although the market could of course collapse entirely.

Lastly geographic diversity is more important than asset diversity, just because one country's economy fails doesn't mean the entire world will, yes China EU and Japan sell a lot of goods to the US, but don't forget that a lot of debt is denominated in USD, so an awful lot of countries will all of a sudden have their debt burden dramatically reduced (an effective stimulus to their economies). So if you seriously think the US is about to hit hyper inflation start buying assets in countries with a heavy USD denominated debt level (nb that doesn't mean the US owns the debt - the US is a net debtor itself, but a lot of international debt is denominated in USD).

Also, it is not simply about how much you have saved, but how much income you can draw from those savings. A rule of thumb is that one will need ~80% of their pre-retirement income to sustain the same lifestyle after they retire.

If you must know how much savings you should have, you can use the ""4% rule."" which says that you can withdraw up to 4% of your retirement savings each year in the retirement without running out. That is, Retirement savings target = Monthly income required x 25

One issue is that I think people got too caught up in very speculative growth themes last year and bought into things like WKHS -- which is now down about 80% since early Feb. That company announced earnings recently and announced that it had delivered 6 trucks. 

Recently SPCE announced that it was not sure when it was going to have its next test flight.  Last year it would have probably been down a bit but bounced because ""Cathy's probably gonna buy more!"" This year it's down 20% in an instant and even Cathy has been selling out of it in her space ETF. (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/cathie-woods-space-exploration-etf-arkx-sells-virgin-galactic-stock.html)

It's okay to have some of your portfolio in aggressive growth, but there also really should be a sizable portion devoted to high quality, profitable and well-managed companies with a long track record. You can have 25 different aggressive growth stocks but that isn't really diversified - if aggressive/disruptive/hyper/whatever growth is out of favor, those are all going to likely be out of favor. 

The Ark-y ""disruptive growth"" had a ""once in a great while"" kind of year last year but when that stopped working in Feb, it stopped working in a hurry.  I said earlier this year that Ark's year last year was not sustainable and there would be a significant correction/rotation, but I think the magnitude of the correction/rotation is even more than I would have expected.

I do feel badly for the major inflow of people earlier this year who seemed to pour in right at the peak of growth stocks and I think young people in many cases do want to invest in what they're excited about and understandably so. But this year has not been the year for growth themes like green energy and it may continue to be a more difficult year for those sorts of things vs last year's super easy year.

If someone is dismayed/upset by the volatility this year, you have to really create a game plan and gradually adjust to a point where you're more comfortable with your portfolio going forward.",['SPCE'],1

Stock futures are down this morning, with tech once again leading the plunge. Nasdaq off 1.2%. S&P 500 down 0.8%. Dow 0.6% lower. That’s as of 0650.

This follows a reversal late in yesterday’s session. Stocks were up until the afternoon. The selling has persisted overnight.

Cryptos are faring even worse than stocks, with bitcoin down below 40k. Investors are dumping bonds as well Ten-year yield up 1% to around 1.66%.

Couple of things driving this. One is a new crackdown by the Chinese central bank, the PBOC, on cryptos. Then there is inflation. Apparently the strong earnings by retailers have fed this fire. (Macy’s even beat estimates. If people are shopping at Macy’s they must be really desperate to get rid of their money). 

Producer prices in the UK are growing at their fastest rate in nine years and as I write this Target just came in and beat earnings (Lowe’s the other major retailer beat on revenues but missed pretty big on earnings).

Does it always work out that way? Of course not otherwise people wouldn't be so high on index funds.  We have no idea what is going to happen going forward, but long standing growth funds are so looked down on from days of 1.1 - 2. 0% fees in the 2000s.  Now we are looking at 0.5 - 0.6% in most. With that I make $2,500 per $1million I manage.  That comes out of the fee.  See 12b-1 fees on any mutual fund.  If that gets squeezed harder it makes it harder for me to earn a living.  If I get squeezed out of the business that is 25-50 people a year that don't get started investing into their retirement annually.  


Additionally, I don't see the issue with earning a commission, I am not just a middle man to the investor and the fund company.  


The biggest variable in investing isn't the fund, it is human behavior.  Managing people's behavior be it starting to invest, increasing monthly contributions, time in the market,  adding additional contributions during bear markets, not selling out of fear, proper positioning of your money tax wise.   These are the things that make or break your retirement, not index vs managed. 


On paper its easy to say this fund is better or this has lower fees, but it doesn't take into account everything that goes into investing.  Sometimes people need a coach or somebody to push them into improving their own financial position.


My little brother is a super investor maxing out 401k, Roth, investing in index, additional in robinhood. 


Started from 0 to over 250k in under 5 years.  He left his job and I found errors, not in the funds, but in tax optimization.  There is nothing wrong with having a checks and balances system. It doesn't take much human error to offset index vs. managed differences if there are any going forward",[],0

That said, the reason why the general recommendation is to stick with index funds is a statistical principle known as *regression to the mean*. Basically, if you flip 10 coins and land 8 heads, that's a pretty crazy result. But if you flip them again, you expect to get 5 heads 5 tails, or the mean. It's the same principle with stocks - a basket of stocks might outperform the overall market for a given time frame, but extend that time frame out and they'll do about as well as the overall market. Except the basket of stocks has an 8-figure salaried ""portfolio manager"" and tons of advertising. Repeated studies have shown that the vast majority of actively managed funds that have done better than the market in one period have eventually ended up doing about the same in the long run. 

So why not invest in one of them? Because the fees are ridiculous and eat into your gains, as compared to the low-cost fees of an index fund.

>When stocks crash, people move temporarily to bonds. That’s a no brainer.

What you are saying here really is that bond prices have an inverse correlation to equity prices, so when equity prices fall, people sell equities and buy bonds for the safe haven, rallying prices, and forcing yields lower.  This is somewhat true, but in reality, its complex that then, i plotted a rolling 1Y correlation between 10s and SPX.  In times of distress (2007-2009) there is a strong negative correl like youd expect (peaking at -80%). however in 2010, there was a strong positive r\^2 of almost 60% (meaning people were buying both stocks and bonds). if you were to plot the running 1Y correl overtime, you will see its actually quite cyclical, isolating between +60% and -60% on a somewhat regular basis.  sometimes people are buying both stocks and bonds (forcing yields lower) and sometimes people are selling equities and selling bonds.  Its not a no brainer by any stretch, as recently as last year, 10y/spxt had a positive 1y r\^2 of 54%

>you also see bonds crashing since then because the Fed crashed interest rates to nothing.

the fed doesnt ""crash"" interest rates, and only controls the most short term 3month rate (and the interest on excess reserves (IOER rate) it lows the rates in an orderly way at the FMOC meetings.  Also incorrect is that when the fed lowers rates that means prices \*rise\* not fall, so there is no crash, but also its incorrect that the entire curve of maturities 2y, 5y, 10y, 20y, 30y falls in the exact same manner as the way the fed moves the short dated rate.  if the fed lowers the fed funds rate by 25bps, that doesnt mean the 10y yield falls by 25bps.  the long end of the curve trades much more on future inflation expectations, and not short term economic trends.

>Stretch it back to 2009 and up see the exact same thing, bonds didn’t recover until interest rates floated up after years, 2014/2015.

I'm not sure which ""bonds"" you're referring to here, but if you look at 10y returns from 2009-2020 you will find that 10y rallied almost every year:

&#x200B;

|2010|\+10.08%||
|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|\+15.46%||
|2012|\+3.92%||
|2013|\-4.42%||
|2014|\+6.46%||
|2015|\+1.26%||
|2016|\+0.45%||
|2017|\+0.89%||
|2018|\-0.73%||
|2019|\+4.12%||
|2020|\+8.30%||

so 10Y notes have had an awesome bull run, despite fed fund rate being more or less pinned to the 25bps lower zero bond.

15% VIOG --for high growth small cap
10% VTI --for a mix of everything

Stocks being: $9,200

         Plug Power- $1207
          Nio- $906
Not allocated: $3694

*I'm thinking about AMD or NVIDIA, Tilray, Sony. No idea what other sectors are decent to invest in as service providers like Edison or PGE have looked terrible since I started investing, and I don't know what other companies might be a good decision.

Crypto being: $9200
At this point in time planning on holding it on an exchange until I feel comfortable buying in.
______________________________________________________

FIRE (If 50 counts)

This is based ONLY on my ETF's so I will hopefully have a lot of wiggle room to get to this point and stay there or grow before accounting for my stocks, crypto, and 401k.

I used investor.gov compound interest calculator. Assuming I put $27,000 in with monthly contributions of $1500 (should be possible) at an interest rate of 7-9% for 27-32 years, at 50-55 years old I will have ~$2,125,000.

From there, withdrawals of ~8500/month pretax at even 5% will result in more money being made than spent, after 40 years the total being $2,638,000. 

Did I do this correctly and is it realistic? I'd like to think that an average 7% return is reasonable and even conservative. Maybe I'm overthinking it but aside from taxes, is the separation of the ETF's between a RIRA and normal exchange going to make an impact on that $2,000,000?  Any thoughts and are there any major flaws in my thinking?",[],0

936,gyovh1c,2021-05-19,t1_gyoknkd,investing,"Well, I think as long USD is world reserve currency, American stocks will have highest return.

Most of world is still garbage. Including China

One way to go around this, is invest in competitive industries abroad, where Americans lost edge. 

For example semiconductors in Taiwan and Korea. They profit from China growth, yet is a industry which Chinese will not control in next decade or two. However I wouldn't be comfortable buying whole market index there. Anyway both governments (Korean and Taiwanese) heavily subsidies semiconductors. So bet on whole semiconductor industry, is actually bet on their government too. Their currencies, especially TWD is super stable (look Taiwan forex reserve). 

When bet on Japan, i would go for dividend stock index in Japan. Many great, big stable companies with 4 % dividend

And I would consider betting on index in India, cause whole market will raise up crazy in next 30 year.

I still work up my portfolio but roughly idea is:
 
- 50% american stocks (market ETF) 
- 15% Taiwanese and Korean semiconductors (ETD for semiconductor) 
- 15 % India (market ETF) 
- 10 % EU (Just 2 companies Airbus, Volkswagen. Again bet on them is betting on EU) 
10 % Japan (either dividend index or I would pick 5 dividend stocks) 

So I am covered for currencies risk, plus betting on India. As well having mix of ETF and few stocks i personally pick up. And in Japan I cover dividend stocks",[],1
