‚ÄúUnder the terms of the Arrangement, among other things, each holder of Plateau Shares is entitled to receive 0.29 of a common share of American Lithium (each whole share an ‚ÄúAmerican Lithium Share‚Äù) and 0.145 of a common share purchase warrant of American Lithium (each whole warrant an ‚ÄúExchange Warrant‚Äù) for each Plateau Share held immediately prior to Effective Time (the ‚ÄúExchange Ratio‚Äù). Each whole Exchange Warrant will entitle the holder to acquire one American Lithium Share at a price of $3.00 until May 11, 2024. American Lithium will use commercially reasonable efforts to list the Exchange Warrants as soon as practicable following closing of the Transaction.

Each existing Plateau Share purchase warrant will, upon the exercise thereof on or after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms, entitle the holder to acquire 0.29 of an American Lithium Share and 0.145 of an Exchange Warrant for each Plateau Share the warrant holder would have been entitled to acquire prior to the closing of the Arrangement. Existing Plateau stock options will be exchanged for an option to acquire from American Lithium the number of American Lithium Shares equal to the product of: (A) the number of Plateau Shares subject to such Plateau stock option immediately prior to the effective date of the Arrangement, multiplied by (B) 0.29 of an American Lithium Share for each Plateau Share. Each restricted share unit and deferred share unit of Plateau vested immediately prior to the Effective Time and was exchanged for one Plateau Share, and the holders thereof participated in the Arrangement as Plateau shareholders. Pursuant to the Arrangement, American Lithium acquired 127,213,511 Plateau Shares, representing 100% of the outstanding Plateau Shares.

American Lithium intends to delist the Plateau Shares from the TSX Venture Exchange as soon as practicable. American Lithium also intends to cause Plateau to apply to the relevant securities regulators for Plateau to cease to be a reporting issuer.

In connection with the Arrangement, Plateau issued to Bedrock Capital Corporation a finder‚Äôs fee equal to $600,625 payable in cash and 2,666,666 Plateau Shares and the Company issued to Axemen Resource Capital Ltd. (‚ÄúAxemen‚Äù) a finder‚Äôs fee equal to $200,000 payable in cash and 867,882 American Lithium Shares. The American Lithium Shares issued to Axemen will be subject to a four month hold from the applicable date of issuance. The finder‚Äôs fees are subject to the final approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.‚Äù",[],1

The article, which was in their popular ""CTO Roundup Edition"", can be found here: https://www.globalwaterintel.com/global-water-intelligence-magazine/22/5/market-map/pfas-treatment-market-concentrates-on-waste-reduction-and-total-destruction  
  
We are pleased to see our technology being highlighted by recognized thought-leaders in the area of advanced water treatment. As the technology rolls out in its first trials and commercial deployments, articles such as this one will be valuable tools to spread the word about how the BioLargo AEC has the potential to make PFAS treatment more affordable and environmentally friendly everywhere.  
  
Some excerpts from the article include:  
  
‚ÄúTechnology company BioLargo has developed a system that purportedly helps reduce the residuals issue. Its technology exploits the polarity of PFAS molecules, by separating two chambers with a membrane. Each chamber contains an oppositely charged electrode, which pulls the PFAS onto the membrane, where it stays bound. The key benefit to BioLargo‚Äôs technology, which is entering the commercial trialling stage, is how little wasted membrane is produced  
  
‚Äì the company claims it can treat 1 million gallons of water to 70ppt of PFAS with only 12g of membrane material.  
  
This produces far less waste for utilities or industrial users to deal with.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWhile sample processing can be expedited by paying a premium for two- to three-day turnaround, laboratories in the US are inundated and there remains a gap in the market for methods of delivering rapid results. ‚ÄúThe technology for monitoring PFAS has not developed as fast as the regulations are developing,‚Äù observed Tonya Chandler, director of strategic marketing and business development at BioLargo.‚Äù",[],0

SHERMAN OAKS, CA / ACCESSWIRE / May 24, 2021 / Petroteq Energy Inc. (""Petroteq"" or the ""Company"") (TSXV:PQE)(OTC:PQEFF)(FSE:PQCF), clean technology company focused on the development and implementation of its proprietary oil-‚Äéextraction and remediation technologies, announces that on May 19, 2021, Petroteq received emails from several European shareholders advising the Company that their brokers had informed them they had received what appeared to be an offer to purchase shares of Petroteq. In addition to being advised of this offer, the Company was directed to Bundesanzeiger, an official publication of the Department of Justice and Consumer Protection, of the Federal Republic of Germany. The link provided as: https://www.bundesanzeiger.de/pub/en/search-result?17. Upon clicking on the link and searching the word ""Petroteq"" two search results appear. If ""Uppgard Consult AB Krylbo"" is selected, the purported offer can be reviewed in the German language. The notice indicates, among other things, that the offer is not aimed at shareholders in any jurisdiction in which the offer would violate applicable law.  
After reviewing all available information, the Company's management notified its board of directors which directed management to contact the Uppgard Konsult AB, Sweden, the party identified in Bundesanzeiger, to request additional information about the proposed offer. Upon doing so, Uppgard Konsult AB provided limited responses to the Company's questions and confirmed that they are acting on behalf of an unidentified third party. Uppgard Konsult AB indicated that they had a mandate to complete the purchases disclosed in the offer. Uppgard Konsult AB did not disclose who the offeror is but indicated that the offeror intended to issue a press release in due course.  
The Company did not have prior knowledge of this offer, nor can it comment on the legitimacy or legal ‚Äécompliance of the offer. The Company only became aware of it upon being notified by several shareholders.‚Äé Neither Uppgard Konsult AB nor the offer has made any filings in relation to the offer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or under applicable Canadian securities legislation.",[],0

There are definitely companies who issue options every year, only to see them become worthless due to dilution etc.  Neither the company nor the insider has anything to lose by issuing these - they're not even dilutive unless the stock rises to the point they're exercised.  Even the shadiest insiders don't tend to pump and dump their own holdings, it's too blatant to the SEC.  So if they're exercising their calls/warrants etc., usually it would be when the company's already on a significant uptrend driven by fundamental catalysts.  Long story short, I generally don't put much weight on insider transactions unless they're buying with their own money, or selling.

Definitely a solid long term play, CEO (Andy Heyward) is the man! I've seen shareholders shoot him DMs and he actually responds, has alot of rights to Stan Lee's properties. Not sure how well the whole 'NFT' thing will pan out, but we will see soon!

The Kartoon channel is growing rapidly, with partnerships and collaborations with Shaq and Disney. Andy Heyward has worked with Disney for decades and has proven to be very fruitful relationship. 

I like the company, the content, the executive team and the financials. ZERO DEBT and tons of cash and partnerships to purse opportunities.

This is just my perspective, not financial advise.

I bought in around 2.50 but have been averaging down during this bear market.

Currently have 300 shares @ 2.08 a share!

But if you mean like ""should I hold through the storm or abandon ship"": Well, that depends.. is there a real storm or is the ship making water because it clipped an iceberg?


In other words: Why did the stock drop? Was there bad news? Is the news substantial to the value of the company? Isit substantial to your dd? Does it add actual new information or did you see it coming? Did you not see it coming or did you gamble in the opposite direction? 

Whenever a stock drops you should try out to find why that happened and if the reason behind it changes your perspective on said stock/company. This will help you decide whether to buy or sell.

Definitely a solid long term play, CEO (Andy Heyward) is the man! I've seen shareholders shoot him DMs and he actually responds, has alot of rights to Stan Lee's properties. Not sure how well the whole 'NFT' thing will pan out, but we will see soon!

The Kartoon channel is growing rapidly, with partnerships and collaborations with Shaq and Disney. Andy Heyward has worked with Disney for decades and has proven to be very fruitful relationship. 

I like the company, the content, the executive team and the financials. ZERO DEBT and tons of cash and partnerships to purse opportunities.

This is just my perspective, not financial advise.

I bought in around 2.50 but have been averaging down during this bear market.

Currently have 300 shares @ 2.08 a share!

But if you mean like ""should I hold through the storm or abandon ship"": Well, that depends.. is there a real storm or is the ship making water because it clipped an iceberg?


In other words: Why did the stock drop? Was there bad news? Is the news substantial to the value of the company? Isit substantial to your dd? Does it add actual new information or did you see it coming? Did you not see it coming or did you gamble in the opposite direction? 

Whenever a stock drops you should try out to find why that happened and if the reason behind it changes your perspective on said stock/company. This will help you decide whether to hold, buy or sell.

There‚Äôs a reason AZ cut the group (and actually most big pharma, though some do charity work), and there‚Äôs a reason they‚Äôre dependent on CARBx help. That said, all the power to them ‚Äî I‚Äôve met members before at conferences and they‚Äôre great people and doing important but unappreciated work.

Durlobactam is essentially an avibactam patent bust (there‚Äôs maaany out there), but if I remember correctly from years ago it had better activity and better class B coverage (synthesis at the time sucked, wonder if they improved the process). The sulbactam combo is an interesting one, since it‚Äôs also a BLI with weak antibacterial activity outside of acinetobacter. That‚Äôs to say that the duo isn‚Äôt more widely applicable to other infections, as compared to the more standard cephalosporin/BLI combo. Might get slow uptake market wise since the general practice is to reserve new agents for critical cases to slow emerging resistance.

The topo inhibitor is far more interesting (the BLI market is saturated), but again, with novelty comes reserved use. This is why CARBx helps development cost, but it doesn‚Äôt have enough teeth (yet) to support companies like this outright.

All this is to say that I‚Äôd sell on the positive phase 3 or approval. I can‚Äôt imagine they‚Äôre going to do sales/marketing solo, but if they do it‚Äôs a huge mistake (high burn, and these will be slow uptake sales). There‚Äôs a chance a partner buys, but I would expect licensing, which allows the partner to cut bait if it underperforms. SP will likely crater by 3Q-4Q post sales.

438,gzfqbv5,2021-05-25,t1_gze8mo4,pennystocks,"The depletion lifespan of the wells shouldn't really matter for the underlying price because the price of the equity should directly reflect the current dividend payments trailing 12 months. Infrastructure and pipeline are in place for these wells and have been for 4 decades which helps with exploration costs. The overall thesis is the dividend is calculated based on the production of the royalty at the time of sale of oil price minus the cost of operating the wells on the lease. The dividend had been at an extreme low not only due to oil pricing but production value since wells were not being drilled and completed for much of 2018-2019 by ConocoPhillips.

Speaking from experience as someone who personally serviced ConocoPhillips facilities in Midland Texas for 16 years along with this field office for PBT and growing up in a family business that had them as a customer for 4 decades, Conoco was in the worst shape of those 4 decades since mid 2017. This resulted in a lot of layoffs and mismanagement of their contractual obligations such as the Waddell ranch in Penwell and Crane, TX. The facilities were empty and operations was at a standstill and why I believe having the new operator Blackbeard come in was very much needed, but unfortunately the changeover coincided with the COVID crash in oil prices. As I noted in my other posts, Blackbeard has drilled and completed more wells in the past year than ConocoPhillips did in the past 3 and should allow for a high production value output as oil prices rise.

If the price of oil and production rise as they have consistently through the next following months, depending on when wells come online, I am predicting the monthly dividend to increase to a range of .102-.142/Month through August and a high outlier of $0.20/month if WTI does something crazy like run to $90-100(unlikely but possible). The above NPI and current CAPEX need to be paid down during that time but with oil prices well above $60 and the Permians breakeven being the lowest in the nation along with Eagle Basin at an average of $36.50. This would put the current trailing 12 month dividend mid of $0.696869 or $16.9% of current price at closing today.

I'm almost certain of this because if you look at PBT dividend for 2017-2019 the dividend payments were fairly high compared to current levels due to COVID and production and of course the underlying equity price matched up with the running yield of those monthly dividends. The question remains on how high of output these new wells have and if oil prices can sustain or go much higher and how long this would last. But investors should pile in short term for the dividends if they produce what I'm expecting for a run similar to 2008 which most investors new was unsustainable but couldn't resist the short term payments.",[],0

Turns it reddit is pretty damned accurate at guessing where a stock is going to go in the near future. It stands out from the others because it turns out reddit actually encourages multiple opinions and holds a standard to independent DD sets that Twitter doesn't

The truth about battery powered alternatives is that they‚Äôre almost as harmful if not more harmful than gas powered due to the batteries not being recycled. In 2019 E-waste accounted for 6.92 MILLION pounds of garbage in the US alone... Only 15% of which was recycled. That‚Äôs 5.882 Million pounds of non-recyclable material that is just dumped into a landfill or taken to third world countries. The best part is that the RAW value of the materials from all that waste is estimated at $7.49 BILLION. It will take time for ABML to establish themselves or even have the technology for E-waste recycling, but it currently is a firesale compared to what it will be. Personally I believe in what this company is trying to achieve and respect them for taking action and trying to fix a problem that has gotten out of control. This stock may not be a ‚Äúmoon shot‚Äù as of right now, but this is a company working towards a future were all capable of living in.

It‚Äôs still a topo inhibitor and occupies the same binding site with some slight differences in binding mode, which is why they sell it as working against the normal fluoroquinolone resistance. I haven‚Äôt looked in detail at relevant MICs in various pathogens, but they seem confident that there‚Äôs not going to be resistance overlap. Another note: fluoroquinolones are generally restricted to gram positives and a handful of fastidious gram negatives.

This is both good and bad from a commercial and scientific perspective. On the one hand, fluoroquinolones are the most prescribed antibiotics (esp cipro), and it seems they don‚Äôt have the same tox profile (cipro isn‚Äôt bad though). Resistance is also the greatest for this class ‚Äî it‚Äôs why every pediatrician hands it out to placate parents. On the other hand, since the resistance profiles are different, it‚Äôs likely going to be reserved for second line use (except in the case of gonorrhea). They also were able to generate de novo resistance mutants, which will likely influence clinicians decisions. That said, since the overall class use is (mostly) gram positives, it may get more use outside or gonorrhea with time/post approval trials. It‚Äôs hard to say which way the needle will fall, ultimately.

All that said, I like the company and product, but due to the commercial uncertainties I personally wouldn‚Äôt hold long term ‚Äî it‚Äôs much more risky in post approval land.",[],1

I had a look at your table for the 2017-2019 divs and they were 0.42 - 0.66 per year per unit, and the price was about 13x those divs, or pretty much equal to the trust's expected lifespan at that time. That trading behavior is also partly why I think the remaining life of their proved reserves matter, also that it seems a pretty logical way of arriving at the present value of the trust. Nice that the distributions are taxed as a return of capital rather than at dividend income rates.

Perhaps you've insight into there being substantial unproven reserves that we can reasonably expect PBT to explore in future years? Or maybe PBT is sandbagging their discounted future cash inflows?

Oil prices in 2018 were $58 to $77 with the annual div at $0.66, production 894k oil 3.96m gas per your table, do you have a back of the envelope calculation on how we could achieve .102 - .142/month distribution around Aug, like how much income from Waddell net of those NPI and capex costs?

Which is understandable - it's perfectly reasonable to think these executives aren't experienced penny stock traders. It's not just Sabby; all six companies who filed 13G's for BCTX are vulture funds. This is exactly the kind of lineup I look for, but only to buy when they've beat the stock to a pulp. The financing wasn't death spiral perhaps, but still included warrants which enable risk-free shorting.

The companies think ""great, the stock will rise when we have positive catalysts, the hedge funds will exercise the warrants and we'll get $30m more funding."" The problem is, the hedge funds don't want to exercise the warrants. They want to hold onto them as insurance to short the stock over and over again. That's what makes them HEDGE funds, and with vulnerable companies like these, the hedge is thrown in for free. If you want to get rid of Sabby and friends, it's not enough to be buying at $3.  The market needs to be snatching up every share available under $6 so that covering on the market isn't a practical alternative to exercising the warrants.",[],1

950,gzi6tj3,2021-05-26,t1_gzhsa28,pennystocks,"Don't want to steal the thread, but think like any short report where there is smoke there is usually fire.  The issue is a big schism between what their goals are ""bigger then Paypal"" and where they are, i.e. not many places are actually accepting it as they claim when confirmed with the other side.  The fact they didn't even address any of the short report with specific rebuttals is also glaring, i.e. silence is deafening.  Their retort was evasive and was more like, ""Hey don't look at these issues and join us instead in how great we can be based on our hand waving"".  

Also, a very opinionated Sharpe has not even responded (as far as I know) about his inclusion in the short report.  Turning the other cheek does not seem like his M.0.

Anyways, in the end I don't think it is a scam, but just a company that puts its abilities much further ahead then its current accomplishments, i.e. Big hat no cattle syndrome.  In the end the market rewards an investor on its PRODUCTION and not its ABILITIES.  They like every company will have to ""show me the money"" in the end.",[],1
