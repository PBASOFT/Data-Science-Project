21,2021-05-19,investing,"**Background:**

Based out of Los Angeles, California, Tattooed Chef is a plant-based, organic, non-GMO food company that grows and sells products both in private label markets and through their own branded, frozen products. The vertically integrated company was founded by Salvatorre (Sam) Galetti and started by selling “generic” products into Trader Joes under the brand “Intella International.” Sam has over 30 years of experience in the food industry. TTCF’s Chief Growth Officer Matthew Williams has also been in the food industry for over 30 years and has been everywhere from Pepsi to Odwalla and has served in various roles from sales, to marketing, to president. 

**Institutional Ownership:**

Being that Tattooed Chef is a recent reverse-merger and a small-cap company, institutional ownership is scarce. The two largest shareholders are UMB Bank and Falcon Edge Capital, who own 5.76% and 3.68% of the company respectively. Going into the Q2, short float is 35.11%, which I believe can act as a bullish catalyst for a squeeze.

**Valuation:**

I believe the stock should be worth $27.32 today.

[Earnings Estimates](https://imgur.com/a/bcL0QHl) 

Very few sell-side firms cover this stock, so estimates are scare. That said, I do believe these estimates will prove to be conservative. However, I will use these numbers and base my model off of these numbers.

We are going to assume a risk free rate of 2.0% and a terminal rate of 2.0%. ERP of 4.7%. And a discount rate of 6.12%% (Risk free rate + (beta x ERP)).

Going out to 2030 we can estimate **aggregate FCF of $379.**

[FCF Estimates](https://imgur.com/a/u9VNXUZ)

Now we must find the terminal value, assuming 2% in perpetuity. So, FCF2030 × (1 + g) / (Discount Rate – g) = $1,148.619 x (1 + 1.99%) ÷ (6.12% - 1.99%) = **$3,217.61**

Now apply the discount rate to get **$1,836.85**

Now add this back into our aggregate FCF through 2030 to get the total equity value of **$2,215.85**

And divide this by shares outstanding to get fair value of **$27.32** today.

**Growth Potential:**

Just yesterday TTCF signed a deal with Whole Foods to sell their products. This is a big deal as it means they also get access to Amazon. Tattooed Chef is currently in 4,272 stores, but is expected to grow to over 20,000 by the end of CY2022. Currently Tattooed Chef is only sold at Target, Walmart, Costco, and Sam’s Club. Grocery stores such as Kroger and Albertsons are expected to come later this year, but that should likely happen as Target has said that “this was the fastest selling frozen product we have ever seen.”

Additionally, since there are vertically integrated, this allows Tattooed Chef to potentially expand into other markets such as snacks and refrigerated foods. We do know that they are expanding over 300 different SKUs by EoY, so anything is possible!

**Technicals:**

After breaking out of this falling wedge, which presented a fantastic buying opportunity, we retested the breakout and held. Anchoring a Fib to the most recent low shows us some possible upside targets. The POC shows us that the vast majority of shareholders are underwater currently, so any rips are unfortunately likely to be sold. That said, if we can break the 1.618 extension at $21.5, we could have smooth sailing until the POC at $24.17.

So I came up with a short-list of they type of stocks I might look for in a period with volatile inflation.

1. Established Brand Name. This gives the company pricing power because clients are going to buy their product because of what they are getting is also associated with the brand and not just the product. Think AAPL, MCD, KO.
2. Commodity selling stocks, industrial sector ([https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings)). Think metal mines, lumber, companies that produce commodity byproducts that are used in industry (no discrete product firms, like jewelry makers).
3. Capitalist Europe. If it goes down in the USA, it all goes down - true, but there is a place where it will go down less relative to others. So, I'm looking at European companies that do not have diversity and inclusion in their 10K. These are actually young companies that are thirsty to grow and will do anything and everything to move up. Alternatively, I look at cultures who are still capitalist, think Russia, Poland, Ireland, Estonia.
4. Companies with more fixed-rate debt instead of floating rate debt. If the interest is fixed but there is more money in circulation the lenders are in trouble not the borrowers.
5. Government-backed stocks. Especially those that have defense contracts. I think that bad times create civil unrest with a potential for internal and external escalation. Think Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Lockheed Martin ([https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings))

50,2021-05-10,investing,"Mental illness is among the most costly medical expenses in the U.S.,  and it has a high cost to employers in lost productivity. In 2019, 51.5  million adults were living with a mental illness in the U.S., and the  number of people suffering and drug costs, already in the tens of  billions of dollars annually, are projected to grow in the years ahead,  with Covid-19 compounding mental health issues globally.

&#x200B;

Drugs long stigmatized, such as psilocybin and MDMA, are rising in  profile as mental illness treatment options. Just last week, results  from a phase 3 trial of MDMA combined with talk therapy for  post-traumatic stress disorder showed results that were impressive.

“This  is a pivotal event,” said Elemer Piros, a biotech analyst at Roth  Capital Partners who covers the emerging alternative mental health  treatment space. “It may not seem humongous, but it is one of the best  and most rigorously executed trials in the space. And the results  corroborate what we have seen time and time again from smaller studies  over the past two decades,” he said, referencing remission rates double  that of a placebo. “The magical experiences kept showing up, but no one  had the courage to take it through to regulators.”

51,2021-05-10,investing,"Before we get into the juicy details, think for yourself: What are you shooting for? What is your financial goal? How risk-sensitive are you? Answering these questions will help to set you up for eventual success and develop your individual asset allocation strategy accordingly.

Let’s get to the facts: actively trading stocks, and timing market entries and exits come with inherent risks. Missing the best 10 days in the market between 2010 and 2020 would mean an overall decline of 33% (see [*Bank of America chart*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/this-chart-shows-why-investors-should-never-try-to-time-the-stock-market.html) below). Moreover, it is unlikely you sell your assets right before a crash and buy back at the bottom. In most cases, the worst days are followed by the best days which would put you back on square one holding your cash waiting for the crash.

### Strategies to Pick Stocks

Although stock-picking follows a more active approach, long-term investing means being active 1% of the time while leaving your portfolio alone for the other 99%. It is important to keep in mind that less than 10% of all public companies drive 100% of long-term stock-market returns. Therefore your mission is to find the 10% and patiently ride the wave.

Some hands-on advice:

* **Limited diversification**, as you cannot continuously research each company you are invested in on a regular basis. The range of 10-15 stocks is healthy, otherwise, go back to the previous section and consider passive investing.
* **Flexible & innovative companies** can adapt their business model and expand their market potential. The companies with today’s highest market caps all have this trait in common.
* **Don’t ignore what is familiar**, in 1966 Walt Disney was valued at $80 million and they just produced Mary Poppins turning over $30 million alone on that movie. The company was well-known and anyone could have picked up a few shares. $1000 invested back then would average you over $4 million today.
* **Know your strengths** and profit from them. If you are mathematically gifted then focus on the fundamentals. If you work in the industry and know the competitive landscape and product lineup, do that. Find your own style of investing.
* **Google is your friend**, look up the approval rate of the CEO on Glassdoor, read job reviews, check the company’s premises on Google street view and go on the investor relations site of the company. You need to do your own due diligence because nobody physically audits the business you invest in.
* **Leadership and the CEO** are decisive for the long-term success of a company. If the leader of a company is also its founder and owns lots of stock in it, the interests are aligned with the other shareholders and hence money is invested more efficiently.
* **Human** **resource management** such as low employee turnover, revenue per employee, diversity, inclusion, and so forth.
* **Deep dive into the company**: How does it create revenue? What is its market potential? Market growth versus the overall market potential of S&P500? What are the competitive advantages? Cashflow structure? Insider selling? Check on earnings calls, shareholder letters, and sweat the fundamentals a little bit.
* **Impact**: Does this company contribute to a better future?
* **Don’t overpay** because even great companies can be too expensive when too much of their future earnings potential is already priced in. Microsoft’s revenue was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999 and still, the stock had lost 50% of its value in that timeframe.
* **Avoid** owning a stock you can’t explain or you lack conviction in.
* **Double down** on companies that you are convinced are great investments for the long run even if you already own shares. If the business proves viable and returns are increasing, then it is likely to follow that trajectory in the near future.
* **Hold & wait**: trade as little as possible to avoid taxes and to enjoy the runups. The shorter you hold an asset the greater the chance that you have to close the position at a loss. The magic of compound interest will do the rest for you.
* **“Don’t lose money”** – Warren Buffett & treat every dollar as an investment.

I believe that beating the market is possible if you are patient and willing to invest time. After all, the business world is like a car race. In the last quarter of the race, it becomes more evident who might win, and your odds can be calculated with minimized risk exposure. Then you invest in the top-performing racers and still reap much of the benefits.

Keep in mind that most stocks underperform the market. The outsized gains of a few winners are pushing your portfolio higher and make up for any losses on the way.

## Cash

Oh, sweet cash sitting ducks in my account, what am I going to do with you? At current rates of around 1% (if even) it would take 70 years to double my money. By that time it is more likely that I am buried 6 feet underground. I wouldn't even get to experience my slim gains.

Yet there is some upside to holding a percentage of your overall portfolio in cash. Besides, you can’t pay your expenses off by handing out your stocks. Holding some cash is in both active and passive investing approaches detrimental. I advise holding approximately 5-15% of cash as it allows you to:

* Leave your portfolio in peace
* Remain calm during market volatility
* Jump in when prices are low and be opportunistic in the markets

Buying stocks in times of recession has historically brought about outsized gains for investors. It is worth remembering, the more it hurts holding some cash in market booms the more likely you will profit from a swift down-market. The best time to hold cash is when it really hurts to do so. Holding cash allows you to be prepared, and you don’t have to worry about timing the market.

52,2021-05-10,investing,"Hi all,  


I've been a lurker and got some nice ideas form here, so thanks for that. Now it's the time for me to give something back. 

I discovered in the weekend that Magnachip is being bought up in a 29$ per share deal while the price of the stock is just 24$ per share. ([https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/](https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/))  


The deal has a definitive agreement and ""The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals"". Also ""The transaction is fully backed by equity commitments and not contingent on any financing conditions. ""  


The way I see it it's a 20% win in less than 6 months (they said second half of the year, so most probably will be sometime September-October-November). The risks are small:

Shareholders might oppose- but this is highly unlikely given the company is 78% own by institutions and the board of directors approves the deal.  
Regulatory things might kick in: this again I think it's low because we are talking about a 1 bil company, not something the size of ARM.

163,2021-05-19,investing,"I'm currently investing with some robo accounts (Betterment and Wealthfront) and am about to start a position with a firm that is subject to SEC regulation and requires that I declare and keep up to date all of my security holdings.  Because of this and the level of the position I'm entering, I'm required to integrate my brokerage accounts with their tracking system and BM/WF are not supported.  

So in short, I need to move all my ETF investments to a new home.   Bit I have no idea what I'm doing... 

Vanguard is on the list of supported brokerages, and from the research I've done that seems like a pretty good option (also open to other suggestions), but I'm a little confused about:

1)  Is it possible to move these investments into Vanguard/somewhere else without paying fees or liquidating/reinvesting (which would trigger a rather large and taxable realized gain...) ?   How?

2)  What to do with them once they are there?  Not sure what kind of account in Vanguard I should be looking at for future investments.  I'm pretty amateur at this and not looking to put a ton of effort in.  I just want something basic I can throw money into when I'm able and treat as a long term investment that will give me a balanced portfolio with an average return and charges me a low fee for that service. Right now I'm charged .25% of my overall amount invested and I'd like to keep that number if possible.   Do I need a managed portfolio?   Does Vanguard offer something simple?

3) Assuming I can move my existing ETFs over, do I need to worry about liquidating the non-Vanguard ones and consolidating?  Or should I not worry about that?  If that is something I should be doing, how do I go about that?  (again, I don't want to realize gain that will be taxable)
