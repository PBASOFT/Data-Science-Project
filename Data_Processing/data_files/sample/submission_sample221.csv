A new junior mining company currently in the prospecting stage, Stevens Gold came across my screen recently. Strong management and don't see how the team will lead it anywhere but up from here. Starting fresh with discretion to do it right the first time.

Charles Malette as the President and CEO with 35 years as an investment advisor. John Mirko as a Director with 40 years of experience in the mining industry directly and was a part of a large acquisition in the past to a company with $172 million in 2017. James Bordian as CFO with 40 years experience as an accountant, holding senior positions at Air Canada and US Plywood.

The brains here at the company are fantastic, very early on, great opportunity to grab a large chunk for value. Love the gold/silver mining space and where its headed in the current economic climate. With a market cap just under 4M you can't get much better than that.

These individuals are priming the company to have liftoff depending on drill results on their property. Very early into life here, good chance of getting in before it becomes more expensive.

Recently they began to survey parts of the property across 213 identified locations. Results will be shared as they come in. The property has been sampled before in the past in 1998, but Stevens is looking for something more modern and up-to-date. Those samples had:

* 158.5 meters in length averaging 0.97 g/t gold and 5.7 g/t silver.
* 140.2 meters in length averaging 1.12 g/t gold and 5.7 g/t silver.
* Seems to be an average of 1.5 - g g/t gold around meters for other samples as well.

Strong but still need to wait for current results. Hopefully even better.

110,2021-05-24,StockMarket,"Momentum is building in the Renewable Energy and Vanadium Electrolyte industry, faster than ever before. Vanadium Electrolyte, VRFB technology & Steel Manufacturing is the hottest trend of 2021 that shows no signs of slowing down.

Let me explain why.

Vanadium is holding a strong necessity due to the increased demand in the Steel Industry, forcing China (the leading vanadium producers) to become a net importer.

As for Vanadium Electrolyte, this 'gold dust' is going to play the most important role for VRFB efficiency. The mineral has proven to last 25+ years in a Redox Flow Battery, whilst performing 4/5 charge cycles a day, this blows the Lithium Battery out the park.

Vanadium Electrolyte can be recycled and replaced with additional Vanadium Electrolyte after the 25+ year lifecycle is up to perform a further 25+ years. Proving to be an effective, environmentally friendly and a competitive replacement to the traditional Lithium Battery Storage.

The Renewable Energy goal is to keep an energy efficient system sustainable. In present times the typical Energy Storage solution has a Lithium battery storing the energy to release when in demand.
Lithium Batteries are not sustainable enough.

The performance of lithium batteries decreases due to its limited charge cycles becoming a 'bottleneck' to the sustainable solution, just like your mobile phone battery worsens after a year of use.
Not to mention the flammable risk factor.

Doesn't sound very sustainable.

This is where the space of VRFB technology for Energy Storage is born. Vanadium is a popular candidate to be used in a Redox Flow Battery. Proving itself, sustainable, effecting and efficient due to its unlimited charge cycles, in comparison to a Lithium Battery.

With how Bushveld Minerals (BMN) positioned themselves with the largest untapped Vanadium Reserves in the world, an Electrolyte Plant due to start construction later this year whilst partnered with the South African Government, alongside VRFB devopment funding, not to mention their 25.5% holding in Enerox. BMN holds a very strong campaign to provide an excellent return Long Term.

Bushveld Minerals - A Vanadium Mining company with an Electrolyte Plant due to start construction later this year and South African Government backing, that also has a goal of becoming a Vertically Integrated business. The future looks extremely bright for Bushveld Minerals",nkayq9,[],1

165,2021-05-26,StockMarket,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 26, 2021**

Stocks mostly consolidated today, finishing modestly higher led by a 0.34% gain in the Nasdaq (QQQ). After the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May it is very encouraging to see market volatility calming down and holding on to recent gains. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered.

New economic data released yesterday shows consumer confidence dipped in April, compared to March, even as more social distancing restrictions were lifted across the US. The Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. 

Yesterday, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

**Highlights** 

* Great  vaccination numbers coming out in the US. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States has administered 289,212,304 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Wednesday morning and distributed 359,849,035 doses. 165,074,907 people had received at least one dose, while 131,850,089 people are fully vaccinated as of Wednesday morning. For context, the entire US population is roughly 328.2 million.
* Amazon (AMZN) announced that former CEO of Amazon Web Services Andy Jassy will formally take over as CEO of the e-commerce giant on July 5. A few months ago, Jeff Bezos, current CEO and founder, announced he was stepping down and transitioning to a role as the Executive Chairman.
* Shares of Ford (F) jumped more than 8% after the company said it was raising it’s investment on electric vehicles from $22 to $30 billion. The company recently announced the all-electric F-150.
* Amazon announced it was purchasing Hollywood movie studio MGM Holdings for $8.45 billion, bolstering Amazon’s streaming service. Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios said, “The real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM’s talented team. It’s very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling ""
* Mortgage applications slid by the most since early April last week, with a decline in refinances dragging down overall loan volumes even as purchases ticked up for another week. The Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) weekly market composite index for mortgage applications fell 4.2% during the week ended May 21. This followed a 1.2% rise during the prior week.

265,2021-05-26,StockMarket,"Market Status: Uptrend (5/5)

Our market signals changed to an uptrend yesterday, making today the 2nd day of the new short-term uptrend. Your advantage in the markets lays during stock market uptrends for simple reasons. Since most stocks are increasing in price during this period, your chances of profits significantly raises when buying.

Keep in mind that the market usually has a trend ""trend."" And what this indicates is that there are certain times you should not buy stocks, and certain times you should. As in the art of war, Play the game on your terms, and try not to gamble. 

Now, market uptrends tend to give the unaware a false sense of ""security"" or ""expertise"" for the lack of a better word. I guarantee you if you close your eyes and throw darts at 10 stocks in the S&P 500 or NASDAQ, the chances of you being profitable are very high during this time frame. 

The trick is seeing the approaching correction and keeping ahead with your stop-losses to sell you out, but when the time comes, the guidance will be there.

With that said, the market condition could change at any time, but you would typically see the change coming when paying attention and tracking the trend every day.

So, Happy Trading, and GET THOSE GAINS! lol

273,2021-05-26,StockMarket,"Netflix was founded in 1997 as a website for renting DVDs. Remember those things? Today, Netflix is the largest video streaming service by subscriber count. Netflix generated $25B of subscription revenue in 2020 from four separate regions: North America 45%, Europe Middle East Africa 33%, Latin America 12%, and Asia Pacific 10%. 

Netflix faces increasing competition from other streaming platforms and traditional media providers. Streaming services, like Amazon Prime (AMZN), Disney+ (DIS), and Apple’s (AAPL) recently launched service, provide ad-free, on-demand content, similar to Netflix. Other streaming services such as Fubo TV (FUBO) and Hulu, provide access to live TV and sports without a cable subscription. Traditional media companies, like ABC, Showtime, and CBS are making their content available through their streaming apps on platforms like Roku (ROKU) and Apple TV (AAPL). Netflix arguably sparked the phenomenon of cord-cutting, driving subscribers of cable companies like Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR) to disconnect their cable TV service while keeping their internet service to stream Netflix. 

Netflix is led by its Founder and co-CEO Reed Hastings. In July of last year, Netflix appointed Ted Sarandos to co-CEO, who has been with the company since 1999.

Fun Fact: The average cable subscription costs over $55, compared to Netflix at $11.56!

What the BULLS 🐂 say: Netflix is a leading distributor of content and has had great success with large investments in original content like House of Cards and Stranger Things. Last year, 37% of subscriber viewing time was spent on original content, compared to just 17% back in 2017. Netflix makes up 8% of global video view time, so there is still plenty of room to grow market share. Haters have been sounding the alarm on coming competition for years, but Netflix has proven them wrong time and again.

What the BEARS 🐻 say: The competition is finally here! It took Netflix a decade to reach 100 million subscribers. Disney+ did it in 16 months! Unlike Netflix, platforms like Paramount+, Disney+, and HBO Max have pre-existing books of content they can leverage for subscriber growth. Netflix is forced to spend heavily on producing or acquiring the same quality of content to catch up. Recent media industry consolidation has created some media powers that pose a significant threat.

387,2021-05-26,StockMarket,"As I posted before, **you will** get a cash payout of $2.53 per share for each Hertz share you own. That is not in question.

Plus, and here is where the confusion is, you will get 1.04 Stock warrants for each share you currently own. Each warrant is good for buying 1 share of the reorganized Hertz for $10.

So, **what is a warrant** and **what is the warrant worth**?

**The warrant is** the right to purchase a share of a company at a designated strike price. So even if Hertz is trading at $15 a share, you would have the right to purchase a share at $10.

**The warrants worth is** market determined. You can choose to do 1 of two things (for this example, we will use $15 as the current price at which the new reorganized Hertz is trading):

**1)** Exercise the warrant - buy the share for the $10 and for this example you would instantly increase your position to from the $10 you spent to the $15 current trade price.

**2)** Sell the warrant - you can sell\\trade the warrant just like any option. The only difference is that you would instantly receive a cash distribution. You would essentially sell you warrants for $5 per warrant. The new owner would now own the right to exercise, and you will receive the cash difference to the current market price.

**Example (the one used by the investor group that is purchasing HTGQ):**

So, in this case the total value of the HTZGQ stock is the $2.53 cash plus the $5 warrant value. Which totals $7.53 on a stock that is currently trading at $6. That is a 25% ROI in 3 weeks if you invested today.

There is the possibility that the new reorganized shares will trade at less than $13.50 a share. Which would mean $2.53 plus 3.50 or less. Total of $6.03 or less. Which would mean you would only break even or lose money at today’s price of $6.

**Here is where I insert that I am not a professional financial advisor, and you should consult yours before investing.** *My belief is this.... Hertz traded in the* ***$20-$40*** *range for the 5 years prior to the pandemic. It had shaky financials for years leading up to the stress test of the pandemic and their failure. But now it has a reduced debt structure and a hot rental market. I must believe that the new Hertz will trade at the same or higher than its previously debt burdened self.*

I think the shares of the reorganized Hertz land in the mid $20's the first day of trading. if this happens 1 share will be worth $2.53 + $10 = $12.53. So, at today’s price of $6, you would see a 200%+ return in 3 weeks.

448,2021-05-27,StockMarket,"Background: ENKS (Enerkon Solar International) is a solar and hydrogen company with business worldwide. I've been following the stock since late last year when it was $0.05/share. It had an intrinsic value of around $0.40 at the time. It first jumped up to $0.50 (1000% gain), it gradually fell back to $0.20 some weeks later and then jump up to $2.50+ (another 1000%+ gain). It has gradually fell back to around $0.30-$0.40 range once again.

Revenue and income have been increasing year-over-year. In Q1 of 2021, the intrinsic value of this stock increased from $0.40 to $0.60. At today's price of $0.34, this would already be a 2x bagger.

BIG NEWS: Last week, the company announced plans to up-list to NASDAQ. In order to do this, they need to inflate the share price to $4.00/share, which is the minimum requirement to get listed. The company agreed to buy the CEO's 25 million shares in order to reduce the Outstanding Shares by 30%. *This is a ""non-cash, non-debt conversion"" to preferred shares, so as not to disrupt the cashflow and book value and hurt the shareholder.* This has already been completed and brings the intrinsic book value per share (that I calculate) to around $1.00. The company/CEO says a reverse split is out of the question (not good for the shareholder, nor the price), so they plan on continued buybacks, including buybacks of the common shares (reducing the Float) if necessary, with the first round being completed by the end of this week or early next week. That is just the FIRST round.

Here is the link to the news explaining all of that: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enerkon-solar-international-inc-enks-123000774.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enerkon-solar-international-inc-enks-123000774.html)

They have hired 2 companies to perform audits, which should be finished within 8-12 weeks, part of the requirement process of officially getting listed on NASDAQ.

&#x200B;

Outstanding Shares: \~ 45M

Float: 15 Million

Market Cap: \~ $15M

**Current intrinsic value: \~ $1.00 / share**

Current price: $0.34 / share

**Free Cash Available: $17.4M**

&#x200B;

Apparently, there is some kind of 1-day technical delay in getting the official share count number updated online, but it will be roughly a 25M reduction, not including the first round of buybacks happening in the next day or two. So I'm unsure of the exact outstanding share count number. However, the 15M float is certain.

They have more cash available than the current market cap, so I believe the plan is to use that cash for buybacks in order to force the share price to minimum $4.00 for the NASDAQ listing.

So that means 10-12x bagger at a minimum. Once it's on NASDAQ, it will probably go much higher. The fact that this stock has already gone to $2.00 (and made two 1,000%+ runs twice in the last 6 months) - without any kind of buyback news, let alone permanent retirement of 30% of the Outstanding Shares, just makes this awesome. It's also got the ""Biden / Renewable Energy"" factor as well, if you want to count that.

&#x200B;

Disclosure: This is the strongest and most undervalued stock on my list, I've been watching it for many months now - even before the buyback and NASDAQ listing news and their plan to increase the share price to $4.00 using means that preserve shareholder value. I bought around $250,000 worth of this stock, easiest, no-brainer 10x-30x bagger I can think of. 

Given that this stock is grossly undervalued, I own shares at prices far below it's bare-minimum intrinsic value, and many other value investors have also found ENKS to be at the top of their research list as well, I'm feeling pretty safe with this stock.",nlv3a1,[],1

It bothers me to no end, the structure of it, and mainly the indexes. I noticed it in 2019. Before the covid crash, the market didn’t make a lower low for the entire year leading up to it. Then I took a look at QQQ from a long term perspective. On a weekly timeframe it has not made a true lower low in 13 years. How can that be possible? There really is zero risk and I can’t stand it. I’ve never wanted a crash more in my entire life. The point of investing is to take risks, but the market doesn’t challenge investors in any capacity.

On Friday I had about $40 worth of brokerage cash that was unsettled funds that should be available for withdrawal by now. During the beginning of this week I've made about $100 (I like to skim off the top) and I put that 100$ into a new stock. What I think happened though, is instead of putting the new $100 in the stock, they put $60 of it along with the $40 that was still settling. Now the $40 of brokerage cash I have is still unsettled because it came from that $100. Am I making any sense? If someone could clarify this I would really appreciate it.",nm4lsn,[],0
