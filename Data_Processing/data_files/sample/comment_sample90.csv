For example, you buy 2 puts of XYZ @ 165 strike for $4 while it's trading at $167. The stock drops to $164 before any time decay really catches up, in this case you should be able to sell your puts at a profit.

The breakeven for options is indeed strike plus/minus premium but that includes time decay. If you let these puts expire in the money then you will sell the shares at $161. If the stock dips below $161, you're selling the stock at price higher than the market so you're coming out on top. If the stock closes at $162, then you're still selling at $161.

Citadel takes the short position opposite your purchases.  This short position (created as part of their market making activities) drives the price down.  The more retail customers buying through Robinhood (for sure seems to be doing this, dunno about other brokers) the more shorting pressure as the market maker takes the opposite short position to stay net neutral.

Apparently, their design had 'negative mass' aka, it was too heavy for its engines to slow down enough to land on the moon. It is possible Congress will give more money to NASA so they can award a second company along with SpaceX, but this will mostly likely be Blue Origin as they are cheaper than Dynetics and have no inherent technical faults.

Here is a hypothetical, that will ***never*** happen: if suddenly all buy orders disappear then the price drops, and keeps falling, and keeps falling, and no one is buying and everyone's SL is triggered (i.e. active at the next possible buy) but still there are no buys, and it is falling 10%, first Stop of trading. Reopen and it gaps lower, 15% drops to 20% lower and the second break of the day gets called. And actually. This would be the end of the day. Finito. Everyone go home, or better still, to the pub. Have a beerio, you clearly need it. Although no one lost a penny today (in real money) on paper they got obliterated. The next day at open, it gaps lower yet again, 25% and then finally after more decline, a order is filled at -30% and every buy gets hit with a sell order resulting from a stop loss.


Now at this point, because as you put it *everyone* has a stop loss at -5% every single position would get triggered and the market crashes again, resulting in another day of early beer o clock just 5 minutes into the session and 20% down.

And at this point the NYSE might forcefully reset the stop loss orders. Or shut down trading for a day until it's sorted out.

In order to shift from combustion engine cars to electric is a massive shift. The R&D would be very expensive, and in general, I just think they are quite different products. Just because a company is good at making one, doesn‚Äôt mean they can effectively make the other. 

Ford also doesn‚Äôt have a great credit rating, so any money needed to pump into their EV‚Äôs will be quite costly, meanwhile other EV companies in general have much better access to cheap capital.

However, most small cap stocks won't be around in the future/won't have seen that exponential growth. I think it's much more likely that MSFT, AAPL etc stick around and continue to grow vs a much smaller startup company that might go bankrupt.

But also, there are very likely a few small cap stocks out there that are genuinely good companies that WILL outperform large caps if all goes well. I think in general, well established companies with long history have more trust and are much safer. The majority, or at least a lot of the small cap stocks don't have that going for them. However, the few small caps that are able to grow, scale and earn a reputation will likely grow at a faster rate than the biggest market cap stocks.

To summarize: Small cap stocks can grow faster but most of them likely won't. There are probably a few winners here and there but those are the exception. My 2 cents",['AAPL'],1

Tesla is also production constrained as a whole across their entire lineup. Production issues happen all the time, especially within these past few months, but they are short term problems.

Medium term, the Biden administration has made domestic chip production a priority with $50B of funding for research and production in an upcoming infrastructure bill which should on the floor this summer. Biden clearly also has Ford in mind, seeing as how he just toured their factory and unveiled the F150 lightning. 

Long term Ford stands to be one of the biggest EV manufacturers in the world. The F150 currently rivals the Toyota Corolla in terms of sales numbers. And the F150 and Transit van are some of the best selling vehicles in their respective segment, of which there is a lot of demand and of which they are also beating Tesla to market with the Lightning and electric transit, unlike almost all of the other car brands with their sedan competitors.",['TSLA'],1

TLDR:  pick companies you know, understand biz model and try to form scenarios on when you buy or sell, try not to time the market. Don‚Äôt panic sell. 

I have a ‚Äúplay account‚Äù where I trade more often and TBH, just having stable companions like P&G, Amazon, Financials like MET, V, I‚Äôve done probably better with the long-term portfolio. 

Learned to be disciplined and really understand the company business model. Going off the hypothesis of their model has helped me stay disciplined where when the market would crash, I would buy incrementally more. 

I also would set goals for myself and if something got to a target ROI, I‚Äôd take some off the top. That has left me leaving $ on the table, which sucked, but my losses haven‚Äôt been as drastic. 

Mistakes I have made have included:
1.  Getting into an IPO on the first days. It‚Äôs not worth it to chase the hype. SNAP went to $26 and then to $12 for a long time. It‚Äôs okay to have patience because things do go down. 
2.  Selling tesla at $28 and happy with a $6 gain because I didn‚Äôt think something propped up by subsidies could do well. I love the cars, don‚Äôt like the volatility, but should‚Äôve held on.

I think they were in the middle of switch up some production and distribution processes. But it was very well known and talked about in the vegan community. There were entire threads on Reddit on where to find it and buy it.

Like for example my go-to drink at coffee shops is an oat milk latte, and Oatly is the brand I always want, look for, and compliment the shop on when they have it. That's been true for a few years now. When there was a shortage, I had frequent conversations with baristas and resellers about it and they all mentioned that it was a frequent topic and inquiry.

So yes, I think in certain cases, brand loyalty matters and is difficult to measure. Oatly is one of the old-school vegan brands and really is better than the competition.

The reason many people avoid small cap speculative stocks is because they haven't built up their history and reputation, so there is inherently more risk as well as more potential reward. So while there might end up being a few winners, the majority of people who invest in small cap stocks will still get burned because of the sheer number of losers as well.

Also it is expensive to develop EVs right now but by the time they're mass producing them, battery costs will go down even more. Probably not as wildly as the last decade but still enough to make an impact. Their partnership with a established battery maker (SK Innovation) should also help with that. EVs also require less moving parts and less complex manufacturing so there should be better margins once battery costs start coming down.

851,gyv6ppx,2021-05-20,t1_gyuvvv9,stocks,"You're looking at it the wrong way on this play.

You can't compare it to the high-growth companies that are trying to achieve mass consumption of a new product over old products.

Ford is still very large and produces many cars and has a wide foot print with lots of experience new competitors don't have.

With technological shift, they will be forced to re-tool. They will need to downsize some operations, upsize others, and create all new ones. Luckily, 3rd part companies are making critical component, like the batteries themselves, so they don't have to build that up front and prices are continuing to fall on batteries.

This isn't to say this is a great buy for massive growth. Rather, it is a stock traders are predicting will slowly go down hill and the market capitalization is very small relative to the size of their operation, rather it is a play at Value. You're making a bet they will have more success at maintaining some market share long-term and be able to re-tool their operations and cut old costs from combustion engine cars more easily than expected.

Said another way, imagine buying one of Tesla's main future competitors for a tiny fraction of TSLA's current market capitalization. TSLA's capitalization is 11x that of F, yet F makes nearly 12x as much revenue currently. F does have declining profitability problems, because of these market changes.

They currently have a P/E ratio of only 12.6. 

The market isn't putting much money or excitement into this, but if there are unknown future hiccups going electric to the masses that cause delays it can be short-term gain for combustion automakers. If Ford can change their operations easier than expected to all EV and remain a competitor there is value not being priced into the stock. These are both scenarios that could lead to short-term success or long-term success for Ford.

I'd also note that the long timeline of transition between combustion cars and electric cars will likely be long enough, that many of the earlier technology patents already established will run out. This will make it easier to competitors to copy each other, which can be both good and bad for various competitors.

I don't directly own Ford. I'm not jumping into this and I haven't really researched it. I'm not arguing they will be successful. 

Rather, I just know it needs to be looked at from a different angle than from the high-growth excitement angle of a new company. It is a Value angle. Cheap price, huge revenue, large brand and foot print.

It is a question if an under-valued company with a far larger operation that will beat expectations on transitioning and potentially scaling down their operations appropriately to achieve profitability in the EV world. There is tremendous value here, if they can adjust and stay a EV competitor in the long-run.

They also have significant brand image and consumer bases that follow them. The F-150 Lightning they are working on is a big product line for them in the long-run. That brand image and customer base is large, if they can make it work and profitable to sell.",['TSLA'],1
