26,2021-05-18,StockMarket,"Hi all! I hope this is posted in the correct sub. 

I‚Äôm currently enrolled in a MBA and I‚Äôm looking for some advice on an assignment in my microeconomics module. Essentially I‚Äôve been asked to give my analysis and hypothesis of an excel spreadsheet that contains customer deposits for a brokerage firm. This spreadsheet contains two columns (sum and net deposits) that I am to base my calculations on.

I‚Äôm attempting to calculate assets under management (image 1). The professor has provided the formula for this however I‚Äôm unsure how to calculate market movements. I know the definition for market movements varies between subject and company so I‚Äôm unsure of how to approach this.

Can anyone tell me how to calculate market movements based off the columns in image 2? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated üôè

However , sentiment will tell much more. I am tired of reading charts and making an educated hypothesis on where it shall go, usually it goes as planned or remains stagnant due to no sentiment towards the stock. So I was wondering , what services do you guys use(if any) to find what people are interested in ? I have been researching COVID recovery stocks as I saw a message that NYC shall be reopening tomorrow , but COVID recovery stocks are practically common sense at this point. Thank you for any suggestions .",nfqbte,[],0

I'm curious about what a company like this is actually worth. I understand any model or prediction is just a ""guess"" at this point, but since this stock didn't shoot to the moon, it could pose as a buying opportunity. 

 I personally use Coinbase for buying BTC, but not much else. Who else uses it and what other types of value does it add for you? Is this a product similar to Robinhood but focused on crypto? How is it different?

I'm assuming most of their revenue comes from trading fees, if they are to stay competitive in a zero free market, how will they monetize? 

I'd like to see bull and bear thesis for this IPO. 

I'm not use to valuing IPOs or growth names so I'm looking to learn some techniques so any advice is appreciated.",nfrvxz,[],0

Pipe investor shorting the stock. 

Short interest info: https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/IPOE/short-interest/

Current IPOE short shares: 25,463,687	 based on fintel.io 

&#x200B;

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pipe investor will get rough 120 M SOFI shares after the merger. 

Pipe investor cost of 1 share = $10 

&#x200B;

**(Doing some math )** 

Merge file date in SEC: 2021-01-11 

Date diff with today = 128 days 

(this numbers are my assumption , feel free to change )

Average price = 16 

Average Borrow rate of  90%

Average daily interest = average price / (borrowing rate \* 365 days in year )

= 16 / ( 90% \* 365)

= 0.0487 

&#x200B;

|Average short hold duration|Est interest paid per 1 short share |total cost |
|:-|:-|:-|
|120|0.0487 \* 120 = 5.844|10 +  5.844 = 15.844|
|90|0.0487 \* 90 = 4.383|10 + 4.383 = 14.383|
|60|0.0487 \* 60 = 2.922|10 + 2.922 = 12.922|
|30|0.0487 \* 30 = 1.461|10+1.461 = 11.261|

&#x200B;

Average short shares volume for last 128 days=  20,000,000 

Interest paid so far = 20,000,000 \* (128 \*   0.0487 ) =  $124,672,000 

Pipe total cost = total pipe shares \* cost price  

= 120,000,000 \* $10 = $ 1,200,000,000

&#x200B;

Total cost =  $124,672,000  +  $124,672,000 =  $1,324,672,000

Average cost of the stock =  $11

So based on this Pipe investor will make $4 in profit if the price stay at 15.

&#x200B;

This played would have worked if the following scenario didn't happen

1) SPAC bubble crashed forced the price from high 20's to trade in 18-14 range. This drastically reduced their profit margin. To liquidate half their shares they will need at least 5 trading days which can drop the price below the cost , therefore selling at loss . The loss would have been reduced if the price had stayed in the high 20's since they have a higher price range to take their profit from.  Put options can be used to compensated their loss but that just adds to their cost of the stock. 

2) SEC change the process of filling SPAC which caused additional 60 days.  This forced additional cost . they had to pay for 60 additional days of interest plus additional PUT to play safe. PUT have a limited  profit range.

Based on this info it makes more sense for Pipe investors to cover their short position now so that they can raise this price.  This will give them a higher price range on merge date to liquidate their shares.",nfwlag,[],0
443,2021-05-19,StockMarket,"Halfway through 2021, retail investing has reached a peak volume we have never seen before. In fact, the average amount of trades happening each day has more than doubled since 2019. Trillions of dollars are moved as stocks rise and fall throughout the day. However, even though stock prices change at all hours, US retail traders are restricted to the narrow timeframe of 9:30 AM through 4:00 PM EST.

The restrictive trading hours placed upon retail traders is just one of the many issues with the current system. Some of the other problems have been brought to attention due to recent events, such as the meteoric rise of GameStop stock and Dogecoin. In both cases, many different stock brokerages used by retail traders restricted the buying or selling of specific securities, effectively manipulating the market.

Time and time again we have seen larger investment institutions place rules and regulations on ordinary traders, while giving themselves the freedom to do whatever they want. Our goal? Level the playing field.

**Our vision**

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) represents a massive amount of wealth and equity. It has a market cap of 26.2 trillion dollars and is easily the largest stock exchange on the planet. However, if you‚Äôre able to freely trade with all the stocks within the NYSE, you‚Äôre still only able to trade with roughly a third of the global stocks.

There are dozens of other stock exchanges out there using dozens of different currencies. However, the time-zone and currency differences make accessibility difficult. We see a world where anyone can trade on any stock exchange, regardless of their currency, at any time they wish. At first glance, it may seem idealistic, or a far reach. But in reality? It‚Äôs already here.

**What is StockSwap?**

StockSwap is the stock market reimagined, with the power of investing held equally by all parties for the first time in history.

On StockSwap, you can purchase any stock you want, just like on any other platform, but without any of the restrictions.

**How does it work?**

StockSwap is possible through the developments of cryptocurrencies and blockchains over the past several years. When you buy a stock on StockSwap, you are exchanging your money for a wrapped cryptocurrency token that is directly tied to and backed by your desired stock, purchased by us. This means you retain voting rights, receive dividends, and keep any other benefit of directly owning the stock yourself.

**How can I start?**

If everything you‚Äôve read so far sounded appealing, that‚Äôs fantastic. But while we‚Äôd like our platform to be perfect, we‚Äôre not quite there yet. Before you can start trading with us, there‚Äôs a few things you should know.

**Where are we now**

As we work towards perfecting StockSwap, all trades have a 1% fee placed on them, capping at $10 to help cover our developmental and maintenance costs. We understand nobody wants to pay money to invest and are working on further reducing those fees as we progress, with our ideal scenario consisting of phasing them out completely in the near future.

In addition, while StockSwap is already developed and fully functional, we are still finishing the process of obtaining our broker dealer license. Before completing this step, SEC regulations require the investment portfolio of any potential client to be greater than 10 million USD. This means, while we‚Äôre currently serving several dozen clients, it‚Äôll be at least a few more weeks before we‚Äôre able to able to help everybody trade freely.

Until then, keep up to date on our progress through our medium and telegram pages. We can‚Äôt wait for you to join us on our journey as we reimagine how we invest.

Until next time!",nfwqnk,[],0

To my utmost disappointment , I hereby declare ,that I chose this auspicious day to begin my journey into the world of crypto. I decided to put in around 10k INR this morning , and dude, am I in a state of ""Numb"".

Anyways , I put in the amount knowing that I don't care even if all is lost. 

I knew this kind of crash could happen ,but not that it would happen in a few hours. 

Lesson: Always stick to what you understand, stocks are always wiser choice since they are based on businesses unlike crypto which really doesn't have anything to back it up(no intrinsic value- cryptos aren't really producing anything which can be consumed).

Secondly  , if a tweet can affect the prices of crypto, are they really functioning as decentralised .

Thirdly , I do think that no government would like to give up control or power, this control is always dependent on money ,which again the govt owns or creates, the government's across the world would never give this away to some decentralised currency . Even if it accepts it for shorter term, the government's would again discard this concept as a whole.

Since the last outlook the price of ZKIN has failed to impress as it has dropped by 8%.

As the price of ZKIN failed to found support at $4.80, while being pushed down by a downtrend line, the price broke to the downside.

The price immediately dipped to good known support at $4.50, from where it has bounce back above $4.80, however these gains failed to sustain above $4.80.

As the bounce got denied, the price of ZKIN continued to fall and went for a test of support at $4.50. 

It has found some decent support at this level, but with continuous tests of this level, it has eventually led to a breakdown on which we are currently looking at.

So where is the price headed?

As of where the price stands right now, it's located on a trend line support so it should move higher from here.

Speaking about support, current support is located at $4.30, where ZKIN has to find support in order to not fall any lower. Makes sense doesn't it.

Let indicators help us.

RSI suggests a slight bullish divergence, but it's about to break below 40, pushing bearish momentum to play. 

MACD wave indicator says that we are currently in the second long selling wave. These waves are pretty overextended and we look for a corrective buying wave to ride the price to at least to $4.80 soon.

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/l2yatqsul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=b664fb6a57f07680d9b86167772bca88c3c162ef

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/i66bouqzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=466d9c41642eed0ecd25a20fbe401151f3357afa

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/ocno00v4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=f814841b4894078e9f5ebed0d92ff4b82596b783

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

*Processing img jcewv8lam1071...*

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

*Processing img yosxpjwem1071...*

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

# Overview 

The era of clean energy is upon us and the timing couldn‚Äôt be better to get behind Joe Biden‚Äôs newly proposed [2.3 trillion dollar](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/biden-climate-plan.html) clean energy infrastructure plan. Clean energy generation is about to ride some huge tailwinds as described by this article on Financial Times.

‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs plan would see an infusion of more than $350bn directly into clean energy driving electric-vehicle infrastructure, reinvigorating the grid and boosting research and development plus an estimated $400bn extending and expanding tax credits for clean energy generation and storage. It would also set a clean energy standard mandating utilities to produce power that is carbon-free by 2035.‚Äù

**Transition to Clean Energy, the Solar Industry, and Enphase**

One industry already seeing increased demand as the world shifts to clean energy is solar. In the last decade alone, solar has experienced an average annual growth rate of **42%** ([source](https://www.seia.org/solar-industry-research-data#:~:text=Solar%2520as%2520an%2520Economic%2520Engine,investment%2520in%2520the%2520American%2520economy.)). Solar is currently regarded as the cheapest source of energy in the history of the world, far surpassing coal and gas, as well as beat out wind and other renewables.

https://preview.redd.it/4vjgoa4ch3071.png?width=758&format=png&auto=webp&s=f94e4243370525359d8b781d773996be18ef94c0

Let‚Äôs talk about one of the biggest players currently dominating this industry, Enphase (ENPH). Enphase is the largest designer and manufacturer in the solar energy market selling micro-inverters for homes, installing solar panels onto their roofs, and currently capturing over 50% of the U.S market. Enphase‚Äôs strategy revolves around four core pillars: new product development (innovating the micro-inverter), residential energy storage, commercial solar projects, and services platform.

By executing the strategies mentioned above they are expecting to increase their Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) from $4.1 billion in 2020 to roughly \~$14 billion in 2023. All of this is powered by organic growth and the new clean energy movement providing margins of roughly 40% which are worthy enough to write home about.

**Setbacks**

Like any industry or company, there will be some challenging obstacles to overcome. For Enphase, one of their biggest hurdles is the global semiconductor chip-shortage, which should give some headwinds until at least the end of 2021. The chip-shortage is not a new headline and has been plaguing many industries. On Enphase‚Äôs recent earnings call management noted that although demand remains strong they can‚Äôt fill orders because there isn‚Äôt enough material for them to keep up with demand. However, these are short term headwinds and the global semiconductor chip shortage is not expected to continue forever. Thus, this represents an excellent buying opportunity for ENPH. In a RARE occurrence even Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, AND Barclays [all agreeing on one thing](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/28/enphase-posts-record-quarter-stock-slides-on-chip-shortage-pains.html) that was recommending buying the recent Enphase dip.

‚ÄúThe silver lining is obvious to us: those looking to take the long-view on ENPH will correctly view this eventually transient headwind, as a buying opportunity on any weakness,‚Äù noted Barclays, while Goldman said that ‚Äúdemand and margins remain robust.‚Äù

**Final Thoughts**

Enphase‚Äôs dominance in this industry has allowed them to capture a large piece of this ever-growing pie. Their flagship product is still innovating with each iteration while they expand commercial and residential offerings. Their SAM is expecting to grow exponentially over the next 5-10 years and ENPH is aggressively (and succeeding) trying to capture ever dollar of it. The stock has tumbled from all-time-highs, which leaves some breathing room for a good entry since their valuation has contracted.",ng8pre,[],0
