14,2021-05-23,stocks,"Hi,

My question is if a company has a mrktcap of say 100M, what would happen if I bought say 1M of shares at pre market for example. Do these kind of trades raise an alarm or negatively impact the stock price? 

No, I’m not sitting on 1M in cash I wish LOL.

Thanks.",nj9s4m,[],0
119,2021-05-23,stocks,"#Disclaimer! I'm not saying i'm bullish (or bearish) on TSLA, just that this particular argument is weak.

Many TSLA bears point out the risk of increased competition resulting from companies moving into the EV space, especially since nearly all major makes now have an EV either in production or in development. 

For one, most of these cars target a completely different customer. Simply, cars like the Nissan Leaf or Chevy Bolt aren't cutting into Tesla sales just like the Toyota Corolla isn't cutting into BMW 330i sales. While it's true that ""better"" or more luxury lines like the Audi E-Tron are coming out, they're still not quite there in terms of competitive features and price point. It's reasonable to think many customers who are buying a $70k car are willing to spending another $10k for significantly better range, a bigger battery, better charging infrastructure, falcon wing doors, etc. Think about it, how many Model Xs do you see on the road versus an Audi E-Tron or Jaguar I-PACE? Yes, those cars newer, but there are other reasons for their dismal sales too. So while there's going to be *some* buyers choosing these new EVs over a Tesla, it's not the doom and gloom that Tesla bears seem to think. IMO, The competition between EVs versus ICEs is much more significant than the competition between EVs.

Lastly and most importantly, this increase in ""competition"" just draw more attention to the EV market in general, which will always be good for Tesla and this is why Musk has always pushed for more competition in the EV space. For instance, if we take the current EV market to have a relative ""size"" or value of 1 and Tesla owns 90% of it, that's a size or value of 0.9 for Tesla. But if this competition and attention causes the EV market to grow to 3 but Tesla only owns 40% of it, that's still a size of 1.2 for Tesla.",njazsm,['TSLA'],0
207,2021-05-23,stocks,"I bought CCL/CUK (Carnival Corp) starting late April last year and made it 100% of my portfolio. Now it is up around 100% (mostly long term gains) and I recently reflected if my hypothesis for the stock was seen through.

Frankly I did not expect to hold so long. I bought expecting a faster return to normal and if I knew in advance they wouldn't sail in the US until July 2021 I would assume it would be a bad investment. 

However, now they are confirmed to sail in July. I guess the hype that is left would be the cruises actually sailing successfully, and then the announcement of what they will do with their reserve cash ($11.5 billion compared to their usual $1 billion or less). They have around $26 billion in long-term debt (compared to $9 billion before the coronavirus) so I imagine it is a priority to pay off that. Then there are expenses of getting the cruises prepared to sail and upkeep. 

So even if CCL were to pay off $10 billion (maybe not the best use of funds) of their debt they would still be $6 billion more in debt than before the coronavirus with their dividend gone and shares heavily diluted.

In fact, their market cap is practically the same as it was pre-covid. In December 2019 they had a run up but the market cap now is actually higher than it was in November 2019. It would require billions in stock buybacks for the share price to rise to it's pre-covid levels (which included a dividend), on top of the billions needed to pay for debt/upkeep. Not to mention CCL was actually in a downtrend from 2018 on, with the market cap going from $50 billion to $30 billion.

So why would I hold now? Even if they have a successful year I'm having trouble justifying why they would continue to grow and outpace the SPY. 

Any other cruise stock holders? I've already started shifting money into a different investment that I have higher conviction will return healthy gains.",njc9ur,[],0
253,2021-05-23,stocks,"Can someone possibly explain to me why I’m wrong. I hope I’m wrong. But the more I think about this the more it looks like a select few people at the top are able to literally create shares, thus controlling the direction of any and all stocks on the market. 

This basically means the entire stock market, AKA the “free” market is entirely rigged. 

They might’ve created a huge bull trap for GME if what I’m saying is true and will eventually let it drop to shit with more fake shares pulling the price down. 

We literally watched them stop the sale of shares earlier this year when GME first went viral. This could of been a moment where they needed to figure out what to do. Once they got everyone at their firms onboard they re-enabled buying shares for meme stocks. 


Why should anyone be investing in the stock market right now? Will the market crash from this? My original fear from the GME fiasco was a market crash. Then it slowly kept going back up after the initial turbulence. What if these people are making fake shares for the biggest companies out there like Apple and Google in order to create a fake stock market reality. And theoretically they could keep it going or short the market to shit and reap their reward.",njcpip,"['GME', 'AAPL']",0
296,2021-05-23,stocks,"Hey guys, I really appreciate you taking the time to read my post and help me. I hope you can bear with me through my inexperience and confusion

I am from Serbia, living here completely as a tax resident. With that in mind, I realized that my personal investments in US stocks will be liable to a 60% tax upon death (inheritance to my kids)

According to this [irs post](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/some-nonresidents-with-us-assets-must-file-estate-tax-returns) ,  Certain deceased nonresidents who were not citizens of the United States are subject to U.S. estate taxation with respect to their U.S.-situated assets. They also list stock of corporations under us law as an example of something that would fall under us law.

Am I wrong to say that I (my kids) will be liable for a high US estate tax and talking to the IRS upon death?

With that, I have a follow up question, and that is, how do these rules apply to me buying UK stocks. Here, I have not found any posts that specifically reference non citizen, non residents. The closest to that I found was this [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/selling-or-inheriting-assets) which says that you only pay inheritance tax on land, but then also on the same page says shares could also be liable for the tax??? This link also might be talking about people who moved out of the uk, and not me (who has never been an uk citizen or resident)",njd3bd,[],0

In simple terms Enthusiast Gaming is company that aims to create massive gaming media network that then could be monetized by advertising, subscriptions, merchandise and content licensing. As such, its not not video games developer or publisher. It is more similar to advertising conglomerates like IPG, WPP or Omnicom who own many smaller agency businesses.

Currently, the company owns over 100 websites focusing on unique gaming  content (Destructoid, The escapist, Nintendo Enthusiasts, etc), YouTube channels with a combined 24 million+ subscribers (Wisecrack, The Squad, The Count Down, etc),  professional Esports teams such as Luminosity Gaming, influencers across  many different social media platforms, and it was responsible for  hosting live Esports events pre-COVID 19. Taken together, its platforms reach an audience of over 300 million gamers on a monthly basis. Enthusiast's esports subsidiary Luminosity Gaming owns teams  competing in Fortnite, Apex Legends, and a variety of other games. The  company helps Enthusiast get access to its own esports content and gain a  foothold in the $1 bil+ esports market.

65 million of the 300 million monthly users are located in the U.S.  alone. This is important because when it comes to eventual monetization,  U.S. “eyes” are traditionally those that have the highest value. Half of every American male between the age of 18 and 34 visited at least one of the platforms owned by Enthusiast Gaming. This is an important  demographic, since it is one of the hardest-to-reach ones, and is one  the demographics that spends the most on non-essential goods and has a  larger lifetime value, since they are in the early stages of their  lives. The CEO mentions how 70% of the company's audience is either Gen Z or Millennials, with 65% of its audience spending more than 15  hours a week gaming. 67% of its platform users purchase more than 7 video games every year. Referring back to the importance of this demographic because it is hard to reach; an astounding 48% of Enthusiast Gaming’s audience do not use Facebook. Altogether, the company has amassed an  audience with significant potential for monetization if it is able to  execute on its strategies over the coming years.

Today, Enthusiast  has 110k+ subscribers, mostly from The Sim's Resource, and this number is up 50% YTD, generating slightly less than $2mil in revenue per  quarter. While management has rolled out subscriptions across a few individual  properties like The Sims Resource, Escapist, and Siliconera, they are  working on putting together an integrated subscription that takes  advantage of their ownership across all these properties.

&#x200B;

>There’s a much bigger play that we can offer customers, and we are  spending a lot of time figuring out how to nail it. That’s our approach,  because nobody can offer, the things that we can offer. And so, we  think our best chance for transformative penetration and transformative  growth on the subscription side is an integrated offer.

&#x200B;

As one of the largest content creators in the gaming industry, with ownership of multiple YouTube  channels as well as esports team, it's only natural that Enthusiast  would enter the content licensing space. In the future, esports and  gaming content will replace a good chunk of sports and other content  available on OTT services today, in my opinion, as 60% of Gen Z people  prefer esports over traditional sports. Today, Enthusiast has already licensed out their BCC Gaming content to Samsung's OTT service, and there should be more deals done in the next few years.

After all these monetization streams, Enthusiast is also planning to  monetize through e-commerce and social networking. However, since this  is still several years out, management has not given much detail on  this.

&#x200B;

>And then, down the road, we have more focus on ecommerce and creating  a marketplace, as well as developing a social network, which we’re  pretty excited about.

In addition, recently acquired Omnia Media is a keystone in the YouTube  ecosystem, providing services to over 500 influencers, including  well-known influencers with millions of subscribers. Omnia Media also  owns its own YouTube channels like Wisecrack and BCC Gaming that produce original content.

Overall, gaming is  going to continue its strong growth and Enthusiast is well-positioned to  capitalize on this trend by helping to connect gamers around the world.  In addition, the company is expected to show strong growth over the  next few years yet its valuation is low compared to other gaming  leaders.
