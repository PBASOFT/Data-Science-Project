For me, I mostly invest for dividends and long term growth. In practice that means I tend to buy with the intention to hold for a long time, possibly forever. I reinvest the dividends flexibly taking into consideration daily market conditions.

It's not like I will never sell, but I tend to have a very specific reason and plan in my mind when I do. I might have bought a security for it's yield and will sell it when it becomes evident that this yield is cut or cannot be guaranteed. I might sell a stagnating security for something with more upside. Rotating into something that is a better fit for the portfolio.

SNBR grew immensely during COVID, but then It dropped hard cause it is considered a growth stock and all the growth stocks got beaten down recently. Recent earnings report was pretty decent.

Most importantly they just draw more attention to the EV market in general, which will always be good for Tesla and this is why Musk has always wanted more competition in the EV space.

415,gyl6ba8,2021-05-18,t1_gyl41fh,stocks,"Nope. His short positions weren’t a majority of his holdings. His fund and many funds are set up in such a way where if the value of the fund drops below certain amount (varies depending on which fund) the investors are not only able to pull out money ( which many would as a drop in value typically means they are losing money, so they panic and do) they can redeem their investment. So say mr big Mike has a 1billion dollar portfolio, he enters a 250 million short position in which every time the price of a security rises, he is liable to pay the difference. Now the moment the liability goes up, the value will go down. Even if he is holding 750 million cash, there’s a possibility that only 700 is actually realized as value. So, the problem with his big short trade was that as the value of his positions dropped, he was liable to pay premiums/fee for the exposed risk of the investment banks he made his trades with. As time went on it added up. So, his actual trade wasn’t a majority portion of his portfolio. This trade and that trade, while both technically short positions, aren’t all that similar. Also, his fund is much smaller now, while he MIGHT manage SOME outside money, it is my understanding that the majority is his own. Happy trading",[],0

With higher rates it means that the safety of return is higher meaning Apple or any company needs to return more to be worth the risk. But in my opinion, that’s needed more with a company one will consider speculation and you have to make insane measures to assume income. With the big tech, you can safely assume and most likely get right what they will revenue. 
It can also be taken into account that higher rates eats into these estimates as smaller companies borrow money to invest in growth, meaning they now borrow at higher rates and that eats into profit which also goes on the estimates. This is something that can be disregarded with big tech considering that they have monstrous cash balances and do not need to depend on borrowing. 

It is due to this that I believe people sold off big tech to just cash in on profits that they got during the bull run. It can also be said that they expect earnings to fall as the economy opens again.

433,gyl6y5m,2021-05-18,t1_gyklvin,stocks,">None of this is a Tesla specific thing

I disagree, Tesla's approach is very different to the competition.

Everyone else is using LiDAR to help establish what exists around them, they work with cameras in conjunction with a 'point cloud' of all the distances and directions to objects around the car.

Tesla relies 100% on computer vision to work out what those objects are and how far they are away, which means it requires a much more complete understanding of what each object is.

If a system using vision/LiDAR sensor fusion 'sees' an object the size of a person, 20 meters ahead even if the camera can't be 100% sure what it sees is a person the system still knows that it exists and is probably a person.

A vision-only system needs to be sure it's a person, work out the size and then figure out how far away it is.  


This gets more complicated when you have something that looks like a person but isn't (e.g. a picture of a person on the side of a van). That's trivial for a LiDAR system as it just sees a big box with a flat side. A vision-only system has to work out is that someone stood in front of the van or is it just a picture?",[],0

The most common recommendation for ETFs are VOO and VTI. 

I personally prefer BKLC to VOO because its zero fees and more concentrated (200 stocks vs about 350 for VOO) thus bigger chunk of the top 200 stocks.

For diversification I would stick to VTI (3500 stocks) but note that this is currently riding a high. So for me, I would do something like $2 BKLC to $1 VTI. Once VTI flattens a bit I might change that allocation.

Again, its all about knowledge. The mistake young people make (myself included 20 years ago) is they do things in reverse. When your knowledge is low, you should start with low risk then move to more risk as you get smarter. Not the other way around. 

The idea that young people should gamble and take more risk is terrible advise and only helps fraudsters and thieves more than anyone else.",[],0

The Institute for Local Self-Reliance notes in its report that “Amazon uses its vast financial resources to sell many products below its own cost as a tactic for both eliminating less well-funded competitors and acquiring customers into its Prime ecosystem, which sharply reduces the chances they will shop around in the future.” In 2014, Bob Kohn, a technology attorney and founder of EMusic.com, asserted that Amazon used predatory pricing to gain an advantage in the book industry, as reported by CNBC.
Displacing an open market with a privately controlled market. By using Amazon Prime to corral an ever-larger share of online shoppers, Amazon has left rival retailers and manufacturers with little choice but to become third- party sellers on its platform; in addition, half of all online searches begin with Amazon. In effect, Amazon is supplanting an open market with a privately controlled one, giving it the power to dictate the terms by which its competitors can operate, and to effectively levy a kind of tax on their revenue.
Amazon leverages the interplay between the direct retail and platform sides of its business to maximize its dominance over suppliers. As Amazon extracts more fees from suppliers, it reduces their ability to invent and develop new products. Meanwhile, Amazon is rapidly expanding its own product lines, using the trove of data it gathers from its platform to understand its suppliers’ industries and compete directly against them. Many of these Amazon products appear at the top of its search listings.
Increasing prices once the consumer is hooked. Already there’s evidence that Amazon is using its huge trove of data about customers’ buying habits to raise prices. It’s also started blocking access to certain products, charging higher prices, and delaying shipping times for customers who decline to join its Prime program.",[],1

I agree with you that psychedelics will change mental health, but I disagree with your comparison to traditional pharma companies for one reason: patents. Alexander Shulgin did an amazing job synthesizing many, many variations on psychedelic drugs, and these substances are - to my knowledge - public domain. I don't know that pharma will have the same ability to patent novel compounds in this sector.

That being said, companies are finding other ways to secure patents - like patenting the actual method of psychedelic assisted therapy (down to room colour) vs the actual drug. Still though, I think this does complicate things.

The problem comes with distance, LiDAR gives accurate distance measurements a long way out, to get the same accuracy with stereo vision you need high resolution cameras (because the stereo angular resolution gets smaller), but that's fine because high resolution cameras are cheap right?

The problem then comes computation, if you want to keep the same sample rate you need a huge amount more compute for high res images and this is largely why Tesla uses 720p for their cameras. I think that's partly why they also use forward looking radar - I don't think they could get accurate enough distances at the range they need for high speed driving with 720p stereo.",['TSLA'],1

I can handle red, but compared to very early this morning, I think it's been down as much as over 300 points since and not only is that going on, it failed to accomplish what it's done from time to time after getting flushed early (claw back and either go positive or be slightly red).

\- It takes 7 months to get to Mars. 

\- The ground on Mars is tougher then concrete because of a thin atmosphere that did little to stop the sun from beaming down on it for billions of years.

\- The ground is also irradiated because of the because of the previous reason. 

\- It's covered in toxic dust, which gets kicked around in hurricane level dust storms frequently. 

\- Once every decade or so the mother of all dust storms happens that covers the entire planet in hurricane force winds and clouds of this toxic dust. 

So to colonize Mars, we would need to send hundreds of construction workers with enough drilling equipment to lay a foundation in it's concrete ground and 7 months of food, water, AND AIR of all things for them while they build magical vacuum sealed buildings impervious to the Martian dust storms, radiation, and poisonous atmosphere. Plus fuel, electric generators capable of operating giant pieces of machinery, and you would have to think of every conceivable thing they might need because if some unknown problem comes up, it's going to be 7 months before you can get them the tools they need to fix it. 

Oh, and after the vacuum sealed buildings are created, now you need to ship the colonists oxygen and water periodically forever. 

I mean seriously, again it's not even worth considering. It's as hypothetical as the warp drive. Until someone stumbles across rocket fuel that's both cheap, and that can propel the rocket fast enough to cut a 7 month journey to Mars down to about 2 or 3 days, it's a delusional fantasy. Any danger to Earth that we can conceive of, a super volcano, an asteroid, anything, still will leave earth more habitable than Mars. 

Now a moon base? Maybe, but it wouldn't be multi billion dollar industry, it would just be an observation lab for scientists like Antarctica.",[],0
