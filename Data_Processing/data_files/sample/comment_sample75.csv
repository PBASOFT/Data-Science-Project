I think that blindly shorting a ""rapid gainer"" is not a great idea because there are many reasons why a company has rapidly gained. Some may have risen in value because they announced a strategic partnership, or has new executives, etc. What should I look for? **I know that I should avoid 'chronic' reasons for gain, such as the announcement of a merger.**

I have NO interest in anyone on this thread losing money. none. Do I love going to the movies and AMC theaters? more than anyone. But they're in trouble - and this isn't FUD - it's facts:  They have 11.2B in debt and burn 1.2B a year. They could sell out every seat for the next year starting tomorrow and they're still fucked. three years in a row, still fucked. They're book value per share is negative 5.13. NEGATIVE 5.13. I literally can't find a listed company with a negative bvps. Why don't they do a share dilution? Because their debt \*IS TWICE THEIR MARKET CAP.\* JEsus H Tityfucking christ , read it again. Their DEBT is TWICE their market cap. I could go on, but the numbers speak for themselves: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/key-statistics?p=AMC  
They're being pumped, and you're going to get dumped on, and the best way to make money on this is get out while you have profits/buying puts, which \*many\* of us are doing and telling you to do. No one here hates you, none of us have any vested interest on you losing money, none. I DON""T WANT A SINGLE PERSON ON THIS THREAD TO LOSE A CENT ON AMC. It actually breaks my heart.

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.",[],0

>>Car salesman LetMeAskMyBoss.mp3

> Just checked with my boss, he said we can hire you as an intern temporarily, and then upgrade you to full-time as soon as a position becomes available! Isn't that great?!

So I said no. I figured they're just an unprofessional EV startup, and I'm not lowering myself to a $20/hr internship position. I figured that was the end of that.

Then they did the EXACT SAME THING to my cousin for a position (he accepted). So it wasn't an unprofessional mistake, they just have shitty/scummy hiring practices.

However, our office is divided into cubicles making it possible for me to exercise some of my creative ingenuity to mitigate the effects of my noxious gas on my coworkers to a degree that they are not able to detect odor at all. Here's how it works: after farting, I bring my face down to the same level at which the fart gas was released. Then, I lick my index finger and hold it up to detect the direction of the wind. Next, I inhale a mouthful of my fart gas, then turn to the direction opposite of the wind and exhale heavily to redirect the gas in the opposite direction. I repeat and continue all the fart has be neutralized. So, as you can see, there IS a safe and effective way to fart in the office without disturbing coworkers.

I know this is disappointing, and you probably put some hard work into this, but this is how we keep the WSB feeds clean for everyone, including the /new feed.

1) Rule changes.  DTCC, clearing houses, SEC are coming up with rules to ensure hedge funds can't over leverage themselves so much.  If they fail these tests they can be auto-liquidated.  Rules still slowly being brought in.

  
2) Margin call;  can happen a few ways.  Buying pressure so high that they're margin called and have to get the shares back.  Tho they keep fighting the share pressure with shady and/or illegal market manipulation tactics.  Naked short selling, dark pools, cycling FTD's or wtv there's a ton of stuff.

  
3) Share recall.  I think this has the best chance.  GME/AMC DD's from multiple different users using different ways have all concluded that entire float has been shorted multiple times over.  GME ceo Ryan Cohen and AND AMC ceo Adam Aron has urged shareholders to vote, or has delayed a shareholder meeting to give more time for all shareholders to vote. 

  
If for example GME retail float is at 26 million, but they receive 100 million votes, that means there is fuckery afoot.  They will be able to recall the shares, forcing the hedges to cover, and that will drive the prices through the fucking roof, wiping out the hedge funds and making apes very rich.  

  
Hedgies are fighting tooth and nail, using every trick in the book (including making a new hedge fund where the website was literally just made two days ago, and the address is a tiny apartment building lol).

It was advertised to people who had no clue how abundant and revolting it was to those who lived near the coast, so to them it was something completely new. These customers (especially those on the trains) began requesting more and more lobster which resulted in the industry on the coast increasing tenfold. \[Fun fact, during this time period small lobsters were 4-6 pounds, not like today's small lobsters of less than a pound.",[],0

Real estate has been widely accepted as an accretive asset in real terms against fiat currencies since, or maybe before, it became an asset class.

Housing is an appreciative asset yes but the asset isn't appreciating by 30% to the year this year just on appraisal. People are buying houses far over asking price just due to high demand which isn't likely to carry forward once mortgage rates return to normal. Also while hosuing is overall an appreciative asset, that doesn't mean housing crashes don't occur, and while I'm not convinced we'll see a housing crash this year or soon, I also don't think housing is going to keep the crazy gains they've seen so far.

I mean that's more like 85%-90% loss for the gamer and then relisting for 50 immediately minutes later is a slap im the face to the gamer. I get thiers better ways to resell but your not understanding the point here of gamestop. They have done the gamers, thier customers wrong since day 1. It was not those who betted against gamestop that put gamestop in its failing position in the first place, it was the gamers for thier lack if sales and reselling back as the gamers realized gamestop more or less monopolizing the gaming industries and controlled the gamers knowing what kind of addiction that follows with gaming and gambling which is that on the same level as nicotine and caffeine. They abused thier power and the majority of gamers wised up and put a stop to that. They in every right should have fallen on thier face untill those idiots who invested in them saved them and in return supported them into still doing the customers wrong. And comparing a game to a car is a foolish thing to even think of in the first thing as a car is a more needed item in life then a game and will always hold more value with a different deprecation rate then a game lol,  But im assuming u were one of those fools invested in gamestop for the reason of sticking it to those that betted against them following on man like a sheep who told you to do it lol.",[],0

Sure, I don't agree that the largest shareholder has the most influence but the fact remains if that other shareholders don't like something they can't push it through.  <10% doesn't give you that kind of power
