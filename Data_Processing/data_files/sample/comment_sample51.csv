Because H2 will inevitably be supplied (right now it's 95% of H2 supply) by natural gas the through steam-methane reforming process. This requires both high heat and high pressure--energetically expensive, and must be factored into the efficiency.

This is guaranteed to be the predominant force in H2 production, should it ever reach a matured market because oil majors have the most money to buy politicians with. This is a law of nature that also must be factored into the calculation. This analysis cannot fail to take into account Big Energy's grip on policy, just by virtue of the system of legalized bribery--in the US and everywhere else billionaires run the country.

So there's the energy to get H2 from NG. The by-products: H2O, CO, CO2. Transport costs to the gas stations, more GHG into the system. Then the efficiency of the burn and power losses over the course of a regular ICE engine--this is the biggest efficiency loss. There are a tonne of steps in this process, it's energetically expensive, and therefore, produces more GHG by-products. 

Don't be fooled. H2, if it ever becomes viable, will be another tool of the big oil majors. They control the multi-trillion dollar extraction and processing infrastructure already. They will use it any possible way to squeeze every possible shekel out of it until it breathes its last breath, and they don't care if they turn the entire planet into the Sahara Desert in the process.   

Until we have home electrolysis units producing fuel safely from our homes, or otherwise cut Big Energy interests out of the equation, H2 will remain a gimmick.",[],0

I’m not discrediting you just on that haha just a commment since you sent many links and I just don’t have much time. I appreciate you reaching out back and hopefully I’ll have more time later to read. 

Idk mate I have severe asthma, I smoked for almost a decade, to the point of like I really had to stop because I straight up couldn’t smoke anymore (hey this jobs stressful lmfao)
I can still wear two masks and a face shield without extreme distress. Now after 8 hours plus straight up extreme stress yeah when I take off my mask I notice that I felt a little deprived but honestly once you’re used to it it’s nothing and again I do not have health/lungs on my side. But again this isn’t about the efficacy of protection (just off the third link from punned) I’m actually one of those people trying to save sci hub btw you should check out the project if you’re interested and can seed from a private seedbox or can vpn and don’t give a fuck about love letters. 77tb to backup and preserve so we can keep reading these articles!!

You're paying a premium to have the right, but not obligation, to buy 100 shares at the strike price. 


Most option traders trade the premium, with no intention of exercising (except some cases). The premium has a lot of factors that impact the price you pay. 


Example: AMC had low volatility two weeks ago ($12 - $14) with little movement. So calls two weeks ago were a lot cheaper than they are now, due to the volatility of the stock rapidly increasing. Volatility is a good thing for option traders, pushing the price of the premium higher. 


The premium you pay gives you the ""option"" to buy 100 shares at the strike price. But you are not obligated to do so. (Meaning you can just sell the option instead of exercising for the shares) 


So in this case, OP likely bought a call dated a month out, for at the time would of been a high strike price. ($20c when the share price was only $12-14) 


High strikes are cheaper, because they are less likely to happen prior to experation. OP was lucky, and AMC mooned. IV, influx of buyers,",['AMC'],0

If you *strongly* believe your meme is higher quality than all the memes currently on r/wallstreetbets/hot, then you may message the moderators.

I know this is disappointing, and you probably put some hard work into this, but this is how we keep the WSB feeds clean for everyone, including the /new feed.

I don't want to say they're going to release the data in a couple days but there's a good chance they're going to do it on Tuesday but I don't want to let people down so I'm going to say one week to two weeks Max. I think it will be Tuesday morning because they have a healthcare conference with Jeffrey's an investor and analyst covering our stock. Either way should be out any day so I give it two weeks Max but don't expect it to take that long really.

Turn to the 1 minute mark in the link to the video below and listen to the CEOs response at the 1:15 minite mark. That's where he mentions a couple weeks and this was a couple weeks ago.

That's a great question I'm actually glad you asked that the reason why I held is because a pre-revenue biotech can sometimes be unpredictable and trying to time the weather can hurt you sometimes in the long run I'm trying to trade it a lot. I got 4,000% gains by just holding and not trading. Sure I could have cashed out at 330 but I know the real potential of this as do many other longs who bought in in the $4 range. and I didn't want to pay any taxes just yet I want to let that tax money stay in there and keep building off the shares I have. Two other things one news was unknown at the time one catalyst we're going to drop so the easiest thing was to do is hold and not try to time all the catalysts. Cuz as you know I'm biotech they don't give you sometimes it heads up when the news drops the CEO stand is a huge fan of doing back-to-back news and sticking it to the shorts. But because the biotech was pre-revenue at the time that price was volatile now that it's getting to be approved it should stabilize a lot more at a higher price.  I also didn't expect for there to be a giant market crash in February lol. But I got no qualms with it I'm sitting pretty on 4k% gains just hanging out 😂. 

Feel free and go on my stock twits you can see in my history (SN is Johnnyknowsbest) I've been in since the beginning. A lot of people sold when it hit $12 a lot of people sold when it hit $20 a lot of people sold when I hit 40 a lot of people sold when I hit 80 a lot of people sold when I hit 100. That's the reason why I don't like trading it because it seems like a good time to sell but knowing the fundamentals this is going up and up. It's the most undervalued covid play right now with the smallest float. They were bankrupt a year ago and are now set to receive billions in profits, kind of like gme they were able to restructure during the pandemic and actually turn it. But not turning around in a minor way we're talking about turning around a company it's about to be out of funds to a company that's going to be a major pharma player. This doesn't happen very often in the stock market but the pandemic made it possible and now with 6 to 10 billion in revenue next year of 50 to 80 billion dollar market cap is not only plausible it's expected in line with it's competition",[],1

5804,gzs27p3,2021-05-28,t3_nmxotz,wallstreetbets,"I actually believe that the highest probability of a buyout of Rite Aid would come from Walmart.

Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategy growth target for the company.  However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens.  In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale.  If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over.  WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.

A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:

\- Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions, thereby lowering its cost  
  
\- All the goods sold in the front end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products that Walmart sells in its department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.  
  
Based on the above 2 points, Walmart improves both its own existing margins and at the same time improves those of the Rite Aid revenue.  
  
The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.  
  
If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $5 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels.   So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payment on the investment.",[],1

Essentially, purchasing a call option, gives you the ""option"" to buy 100 shares at the strike. But you don't have to. You can just sell the option. 


A put is the opposite. Purchasing a put options gives you the right to SELL 100 shares at the strike. But you don't have to. You can just sell the option instead.


The money you pay and recieve from buying / selling the option is called the premium.

I’m 19, I’m not rich, I’m not an experienced investor, I don’t claim to know everything. My account value was $96000CAD earlier today, now it’s around $68k. It’s a lot of money for me, but I truly do not care. I’ve spent countless hours everyday for the past four months learning everything I could about the stock and trading in general. I have 100% conviction in the stock and my reason for investing in it hasn’t changed. They can take me down to $5 again and I’ll simply continue to wait for the pieces to fall into place.

That’s the power that research and conviction has when holding a stock. I’m grateful everyday that I’m not sitting here panicking looking at the chart, unaware of why it’s going up or why it’s going down. And so I hope that anyone reading my comment can truly understand the importance of distancing yourself from your emotions, and that as long as the reason why you invested in the stock hasn’t changed, there’s no reason to make any impulsive decisions.",[],0

That's because someone ""wrote"" these contracts. Obligating the ""writer"" to commit to buying 100 shares or selling 100 shares at whatever strike price they chose. 


So someone out there, ""wrote"" a call contract our OP purchased.... (allowing the call ""writer"" to collect the premium) but they are now obligated to sell 100 shares to OP at $20. Even though, market value is now well above $20. 


This is where your profit comes in. OP now has an option to exercise the 100 shares or just sell the option. 


Obligating the call ""writer"" to sell the 100 shares to OP at $20. Even though market value may be $30. 


Resulting in: (current price $30) - (strike price $20) = $10 profit per share × 100 shares = 1k profit.

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the last price of **100.92** which gives us a total value of:

Am since a year on the stock market and have paid in the time my starter money, 1000 euros miserably as apprenticeship money. Am therefore broke. Who does not know it, back and forth makes pockets Empty, on shares where already exceeded their ATH have entered and then the course slipped into the ground, made a lot of minus because of it and bye the dip.... Has also brought nothing.

Now I stand here, do not know what to do.

Will then buy amc shares and of course prove this with nem screenshot.



I just try times, would be happy about any donation.

Thanks a lot for that.

Apes stay together

FOMO comes in a tidal wave then leaves slowly.

Bag holders typically hold for a long time till they become demoralized and then eventually sell to just hold forever because why bother taking massive losses. When things don't go in their favor there are a lot of day traders that dump everything first before the major fall thus causing the drop.

If you use AMC and GME as the basis for investing then you will lose everywhere but AMC and GME. Really we had a short squeeze on AMC already and there were not too many shorts. If people didn't get margin called at $35 then they are probably not going to leave or doubled down. Most of the low price shorts are most likely out or have enough reserves to weather this. 

Of course this is just my opinion and these meme stocks are completely illogical at times. Personally I like taking half profits then seeing if it rises more. If it doesn't then I still come out ahead.","['GME', 'AMC']",0

8226,gzs5yma,2021-05-28,t3_nmuzzi,wallstreetbets,"Here's my summary of Novavax's current status:

CONS:  
\- Novavax PR/IR do not communicate well with their respective communities  
\- Novavax' management has unusually low-energy in interviews  
\- US PREVENT-19 trial results converted from ""# of events"" to ""time based"" due to 60% dropouts (the # of dropouts was slowed by initiating crossover)  
\- Other EUAs also deferred to Q3 (""as early in quarter as possible"")  
\- 150M/mo goal moved from Q3 to Q4 due to shortage of raw materials  
\- No mention of when NanoFlu goes into arms  
\- No mention of why Texas production hasn't started  
\- Flu/Covid combo vaccine not broadly in arms until after 2022  
  
  
PROS:  
0) nothing in the above materially changes a successful outcome, except dates -- by a little, not much  
1) Highest efficacy against original Covid-19 strain (\~96%)  
   \- Pfizer: 95%  
   \- Moderna: 94%  
   \- J&J: 72%  
   \- AstraZeneca: 62%  
   \- CanSino: 65%  
   \- Sinopharm: 79%  
   \- Sinovac: 50%  
   \- Sputnik: 91% (questionable)  
2) Highest efficacy against South Africa variant (\~60%)  
   \- Novavax: 60%  
   \- J&J: 57%  
   \- AstraZeneca: 10%  
   \- others: horrible  
3) Excellent efficacy against UK variant (86%)  
   \- Novavax’s technology shows excellent cross-protection against drifted strains and mutations  
   \- this aspect of Novavax's technology was recently proven /w its Flu vaccine ...handily beating the market leader: Fluzone  
   \- We'll learn MUCH more about this once PREVENT-19 results are published  
4) Highest single-dose efficacy (83.4%)  
\- better than JNJ  
5) Highest levels of Antibodies: 600% higher than the next-best vaccine!  
\- the Novavax vaccine probably will last for about 5 months longer than the next best vaccine  
6) To the best of my knowledge, NVX-Cov2373 is the only vaccine shown to produce ""sterilizing immunity""  
\- what's that? it prevents an innuculated person from spreading the virus  
	\- a clear (and huge) advantage  
7) The only major Covid vaccine that can EASILY be made into a multivalent vaccine that contains multiple variants in a single dose  
\- 60-80% less antigen (5μg) than RNA vaccines  
	\- NanoFlu already has 4 strains of the flu in its dose   
	\- when asked how many strains he could get into a single jab, Stan said ""lots"" and ""unlimited""  
	\- This may prove to be the most important factor for determining which vaccine is best  
	\- This is the future; Others can't do this  
8) Novavax has the highest manufacturing capacity ...slated to be about  
= 700M doses in 2021 (w/o SK, SII. Pessemistic view)  
\- 2B run-rate by end of 2021 (w/o SK, SII)  
	\- 3+B run-rate /w SK, SII by early 2022  
9) Novavax has ""lowest cost per dose"" (Bill Gates)  
10) Novavax has simplicity of manufacturing  
\- ""the composition of the Novavax makes it arguably the simplest yet to manufacture""  (Al Edwards)  
11) Novavax has the most geographically-diversified production  
\- US, EU, UK, Japan, South Korea, India, and Canada  
12) Novavax has the highest quality group of partners  
\- Not just first place, Novavax ""has taken partnerships to a whole other level""  
13) Beats all other manufacturers /w easiest distribution and storage requirements  
   \- 36°F to 46°F ...normal refrigeration  
   \- stores for up to 6 months  
14) Best tolerability (% issues)  
   \- Novavax: 40%  
   \- Pfizer: 91%  
   \- Moderna: 90%  
   \- others: worse than Novavax  
15) Longest durability of protection  
16) Developed w/o the use of fetal cell lines (this will become an issue once there is ""choice"" of vaccines)  
17) Novavax is very undervalued with tremendous upside, making it a strong buy  
18) Novavax continues to be largely off the radar for the general public  
19) The mainstream media (including most of the financial media) and the market have not yet started to pay attention  
20) Analyst Josh Schimmer (Evercore ISI), believes Novavax is the “vaccine to beat”  
21) Analysts at B. Riley (Mayank Mamtani) and JP Morgan said Novavax is ""best-in-class""  
22) “strong potency and unique tolerability”  
23) an extremely large addressable market  
24) a market cap of only \~$13B (tiny compared to all other pharma cos)  
25) Biotech and pharma companies are normally valued at a price-to-sales multiple of 6-7x  
26) suffice it to say that a EOY price target of $422 is being fairly conservative  
27) if the company shows signs that it will achieve its goal of a 2 billion annual capacity run-rate by mid/end 2021, the price target would rapidly jump higher  
28) The target should also go higher as:  
\- its vaccine receives approvals in various major countries  
\- it is rolled out and becomes a far larger part of the public's consciousness  
\- the company should have significant pricing power by having the best vaccine  
29) If it's production capacity reaches 3 billion, the rise in the share price skyrocket  
30) This does not count revenues of its flu, maleria, or RSV vaccines  
\- Best in class Maleria vaccine  
\- The market for RSV vaccines is over $5 billion, and it's the only RSV vaccine on the market!!  
31) the NOVX downside a month ago was about 4 times higher than now. There is still a very large amount of upside.  
32) Best risk/reward profile from an investment standpoint  
33) UK EU CA NZ AU US MX IN UA ID KR PH CH JP   
  
These and its many other advantages  
\- make it the top vaccine  
\- allow Novavax to charge a premium  
\- will give Novavax the largest share of the long-term market (as much as 45% of world market)  
  
Novavax clearly gets the title of ""best Covid vaccine stock"" !!!!!!!!!!  
$750 likely w/i 1 year!!",[],1

This group is called wall street BETS. Its a casino. When you buy you bet that a short squeeze will happen. AMC is very hyped so the recent gains are probably not related to shorts. They are more likely the result of regular trading of a hyped stock.   


When the short squeeze effect starts the stock should multiply drastically in value, way beyond these rather ""normal"" fluctuations. When this happens its all a matter of group psychology, the longer everyone holds, the larger the gains. But if you as an individual miss the peak by a lot, then you risk losing everything. The peak will happen when the majority starts selling.

Even then, H2 fuel replacements will just be a transition away from the consumer ICE marketplace. 

Given the same price, would you rather have a vehicle that burns fuel and needs oil changes or one that doesn't do either, which do you want? I know which one sounds more appealing to the average person.

The advent of EVs throws the efficiency question out the window for ICE vehicles. They simply can't compete with upwards of 70% efficiencies from EVs, plus the low maintenance, no oil changes, extension of battery pack life, etc. 

These other fuels do have a place in the transportation needs of the future--drones, aircraft, industrial machinery, all will continue to use liquid fuels for combustion, but the retail ICE market will be displaced by batteries and nothing will stop that now.",[],0

If you *strongly* believe your meme is higher quality than all the memes currently on r/wallstreetbets/hot, then you may message the moderators.

I know this is disappointing, and you probably put some hard work into this, but this is how we keep the WSB feeds clean for everyone, including the /new feed.

Imagine you’re me. Relatively tall, spent years being very athletic, used to be able to run a five minute mile, had sub 18 minute 5k times in high school, used to play soccer as a middie. Then you stopped, because there were other, more interesting things. Things with more laughter. Great, let’s do those things. And you don’t realize it, but gradually, you’re eating the same amount and not working out at all. You go from 160 pounds to 180, then 200, but it doesn’t really look like you weigh much more, right you’ve still been getting a little taller, it’s only natural, and then you hit 210, 230, 240, but you’re fine, you’re still in a pretty good shape, honestly, because you’re tall. Somewhere in the middle of this is a year of constant athleticism and acrobatics and you get down to a *very fit* 210. Great, you’re doing good, you don’t look your best, but whatever. You work in fine dining after this, you’re walking 10-20k steps a day, boom, you’re still fine.

*Then the pandemic hits. You move into your parents’ basement. You eat free food. Develop a chic fil a addiction, stop cooking for yourself, watch movies and the stock market all day for six months.* 250lbs, you now have a beer belly, your clothes don’t fit, you’re out of it.

You move out. You get an apartment outside of Boston. You get bored, and you realize: I have to start working out again. I don’t have a fucking choice, I’m miserable, my body is begging me to move. Fine. You slowly build your way up over a month, boom, you’re getting there, it’s hell, you take breaks in between but honestly nothing is *too hard*

Then today happens. Let’s talk about the SOD.

> 6 Min, EMOM, Odds: 30 seconds each side side plank, Evens: Foam Rollers.

No problem, I’ve got this. Surely this doesn’t mean there’s going to be an intense WOD... Nice, easy day, right? Murph is coming up! Let’s not kill them!

> 50 Burpees

> 500 Meter Row

> 40 Power Cleans

> 400 Meter Run

> 30 Weighted Forward Lunges

> 500 Meter Row

> 20 Thrusters

> 400 Meter Run

> 10 Chest To Bars (But obviously I did fucking ring rows)

Happily the slowest one there, feel exhausted, but also super proud. Wasn’t a light workout. 28:43. Gonna find a way to swim this weekend as my workout, take some walks, but I’m gonna be there on Monday for the Murph.

I love my ICE car.  I'd love to run it on H2.  Personally I dont trust BEVs and every Li-ion battery I've had didnt last after a few years (I know car batteries are more robust).  Infact I had a cell phone battery nearly blow up, the casing was bulged out like a balloon.  If I could I'd remove all the computer dependency out of the car I'd do it too.

People think about H2 in small passenger vehicles all wrong.  Forget efficiency for a moment.  Once we get away from gas reforming and H2 is made off peak hours from the grid.  It'll be freely sourced from water or waste.  Solar, wind, hydro, nuclear will make the H2 free too.  It'll be abundant and clean the air by using it.  They have materials in development that can store H2 4x as compact as traditional tanks and contain 5x the fuel.  Couple that with ultra capacitors or batteries that dont rely on rare earth metals or toxic lithium and the benefits out way any efficiency arguments to me.",[],0

9974,gzs9532,2021-05-28,t1_gzs81qg,wallstreetbets,">I love my ICE car. I'd love to run it on H2. Personally I dont trust BEVs and every Li-ion battery I've had didnt last after a few years (I know car batteries are more robust). Infact I had a cell phone battery nearly blow up, the casing was bulged out like a balloon. If I could I'd remove all the computer dependency out of the car I'd do it too.

This is all understandable as an emotional response to the changing market, but ultimately this approach ignores the raw reality that BEVs are vastly more efficient and lower cost of maintenance than anything else. By a longshot.

There's no motivation to put a tonne of money into H2--especially into large-scale production of consumer level electrolysis--because BEVs already solve every problem with *higher* efficiency. People and companies have better things to spend their money on than a problem that's already solved. They'd end up spending a fortune for a final product that's less than half the efficiency with current BEV tech.

Who's taking that deal? Someone with a large marketing budget.",[],0
