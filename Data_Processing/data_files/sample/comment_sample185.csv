I have had sweet, *unrealized* gains with those tickers plenty of times. But every single time, even if I didn't screw up and panic sell on a dip, I still let loads of unrealized gains slip through my fingers. There's reason why not everyone gets rich left and right even when so many stocks rocket all the time. Everyone holding gets to experience the juicy unrealized gains, but only a fraction of folks actually realize notable gains. The peak never lasts and it often doesn't take long to go from being rich to bleeding cash. I like the digital cash because while it's a lot more volatile, I have faith in it rising overall in the future so it's fine for me to not constantly watch it. With these stocks, anything can happen and their price isn't being driven by long term fundamentals (for the most part) but pressure against shorting.

The best way to look at investment is that your money at any given time could be doing one of a million things, and you are choosing which is the best possible thing it could be doing right now.

So it's more like this:

Bought ABC at $10 a while back, can sell for $30 now. Why are you selling -> seems it's going to go down from now so sell high.

Fine then, sell. Now it's cash. Is it cash for long? Are you going to wait for it to get to $20? No. It's getting invested into YYY that is currently at $10 and you think it will become $30.

Fast forward, now ABC is $20 again, and YYY is $30. Do you sell YYY to buy ABC? No, because ABC will only get to $30, but YYY is slated to get to $50 in the same time frame.

This is the same logic by which it makes sense to take a loss and sell at a bad stock time, if there's a better opportunity elsewhere.

Say you are all in YYY and it tanks overnight. You bought at $10 but it fell to $8. But ABC fell to $5 and you feel certain that ABC will climb back to $30 faster than YYY. Then sell YYY, take the loss, and get into ABC asap. Because of the million things your money could be doing right now, getting into ABC is the best thing you can see in this very moment, including taking the loss at YYY.",[],1

But when you have the balls to sell, then be happy with the money you just made. You made it because of your decision and no one can take it. THE WORST THING you can do is sell and get back in after it keeps rising or starts falling. Both are amazing death traps to neutralize your previous profits.

Learned that lesson when I started, roughly 5 or 6 years ago. Back then I had 2k and made an amazing high risk trade that returned a profit of 12k after a single day, so I had 14k. Those were options on oil with a price of 0.02 (the lowest it can go) and I put in all of my money. A tweet from the previous president made that happen - but that contract didn't stop at 0.12 where I sold, it surged up to beyond 1.50. Just to realize how much I missed out, I could have made 75 times of what I put in, or 2000x75=150000€ just after starting with 2k. So what happened afterwards? I went for the next one at 0.02 and put in 2k again. This time it went down. And it went really far down. The broker started closing my positions because I was hitting the margin call and at that point I sold the rest. Luckily I still had 3.5k left, but that could have wiped out pretty much all of my account by being stupid as hell.",[],0

If you want a shorter time frame, look for technical analysis indicators that can predict, to a certain degree, of how the price could perform on an intraday/daily timeframe as traditional business metrics and valuations aren’t very important at all within a 4 day time period (unless there’s an earnings report or external information, but on a general basis they’re not important)

Experience is the best way to learn, dont expect that you are going to pick a stock and that first stock you pick is THE ONE that is going to make you rich, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, you have to get the feeling.

One of the most important things though is that time in the market is better than to time the market.

I started low and i have been building up my portfolio every month, i have seen it being +150% and -35%.

I learned the hard way on how to buy the dip and never sell at a loss.

To INVEST is not so hard, just don't pick a crazy stock with no fundamental analysis (what happened with Nikola) and if you keep investing bit by bit every month it shouldn't be so bad.

Though its possible to make some hard to decrypt stuff with a QC I seriously doubt they are reliable or powerful enough right now for any actual productive use and as said before, you can easily make a non QC algo that is just as powerful. At best, they are probably just creating algorithms that might work once there is a reliable QC with enough qbits that it wont be trivial.

The cancer thing is nonsense. Makes absolutely no sense to use a QC in that manner. The problem with cancer is we have no way to actually get the data needed to work on a custom cure nor a way to create a custom DNA-targetting compound to specifically target only the cancer cells. This is not a number crunching problem. We literally dont have the tools for it yet. We need a way to more quickly map DNA (we just recently have been able to do that and its still expensive) and we still need a way to scan surface structures for active sites that might come into contact with the targeting compound. 

AFAIK, we have no accurate surface scanning tech yet nor am I certain that its even possible from a practical perspective. Rather what we are trying to do is map genes to what they create and extrapolate the cell structures from that. This is probably the right way to do it but we are no where near that goal. Not even close. I mean... we just now started producing highly accurate and relatively fast DNA sequencers in the last 5 years. See Pacfic Biosciences. Im not sure how far we are on gene mapping yet and thats just step 2. There are like 3 more steps after that, each more complex than the last. So in other words, we dont need the QC for this yet. We will eventually, but probably not yet.",[],0

However,

JOAN is looking exceedingly undervalued at the moment, and could definitely be one to look in to. This is one that I found in a thread on here a week or two ago, and I ended up opening a small position (50 shares). I like the risk/reward because it is more about JOAN coming up to a reasonable valuation instead of somehow drastically increasing business. 

They also just announced that they will be paying a dividend of .10 per share (.40 per year) starting June IIRC. This places the yield at around 2.7% which all in all is not bad. The fact that they have decided to start paying out a dividend is a good sign to me because it tells me that they are expecting cash flow to increase.


A few others to look at: ABR, CRSR, BFI, UTZ, NEGG (Market cap on NEGG hasn't updated on many services yet, it's actually around 4.5 to 5bln, not 70mln).

NEGG likely won't 10x as it is just too niche of a website at this point, but the potential for a decent multiple is still there.

NASDAQ: RAVE:  
  
\- Franchises two pizza brands with 160+ stores across the US and 30+ in international locations  
  
\- Full franchise business model to save on costs  
  
\- Brand new management with a track record of bringing franchises back from the dead  
  
\- Posted strong profits and cash flows in 2020 despite COVID - profits up more than 6x yoy by the end of 2020 with net cash balance sheet of $4+ million  
  
The company has been served a delisting notice by NASDAQ multiple times yet it comes back every time so I have a good feeling on this one. It's pretty cheap right now trading around $1 ish but with the upcoming economic reopening, I'm hopeful they will break $2 at the minimum. Restaurants are bound to have more business this summer with the vaccine rollout, stimulus checks, economic reopening and what not, which means more earnings and cash for RAVE on top of what they already have despite a dreadful year for small businesses.

735,gzpjztd,2021-05-28,t1_gzp51ic,stocks,"Basically, the actual price of the share means absolutely nothing. It could be 5 cents or $500. The $500 share could be cheap and the 5 cents one could be expensive. 

Ways that you can decide whether a stock is overpriced are: P/E ratio- this is one of the main stats that people look at; a lot of people consider around 20 as the sort of fair value point so above 20 could be considered on the high side. 
Also look at their market cap and the amount of free money the company is generating (called free cash flow). If the company's market cap (which is the amount of shares multiplied by the share price) is $20 billion then you would expect/hope that the company would actually generate that much cash over the next few years to warrant that valuation. 

CloudFlare has a market cap of $25 billion but they have negative cash flows currently. So it's safe so say that it's highly speculative. You wouldn't be able to value the company in a traditional way like this because they aren't generating free cash and they aren't making a profit. So you would have to instead do a lot of research into the company and decide how much you think they will grow and what their earnings may be 10 years from now.

The market is not like a piggy bank; money doesn't go into or out of it. When somebody buys a stock, they are buying it from somebody else.  For every buyer, there is a seller on the other side of the trade. So if I buy a share of stock for $100 dollars, somebody else just sold a share of the same stock for $100. The money doesn't end up in the market; it ends up in somebody else's account. You can talk about the total amount of money transacted in the market, though that could be just a matter of shares being traded back and forth with no price movement. You could also talk about the total amount of capital that companies raise by issuing shares of their stock and selling them, which is what the top-level comment of this thread is getting at, but that is not affected by transactions on the secondary market that don't involve the company itself. However, it doesn't really have any meaning to talk about money being put into the market, because the stock market fundamentally isn't something that stores money.

I did it a few years ago. I called the dealership with model and colors and asked what the lowest price you can give me that for? The kid on the phone rattled off a number that was way below the holiday sale price in the paper and I hurried to the store.

 I told the salesman what happened and he about shit himself. He played every possible game to try to get me to switch models, add upgrades, etc so he could put me back on the sticker price. I stuck to the number I was quoted. It took three hours and a bogus finance contract (I paid that off a couple of days later) but I took it home.
