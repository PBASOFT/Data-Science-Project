One thing I'm curious about is how much the Pandemic effects on increase in business at select retailers will wear away. Large big box stores had an easier time adjusting to the shopping needs of the pandemic.

On the flip-side, the pandemic might have pushed both consumers and retailers to try new business models that will help counteract online e-commerce only companies.

People now know how to do curbside pick ups, in-store pick ups and retailers have learned how to handle more consumers doing that. This might give some retailers a quicker adjustment to new strategies to work with their own e-commerce operations or become more convenient option vs. competition from e-commerce only.

\- Lowe's is currently up \*50%\* from its \*preCOVID high\*. That is incredible and unprecedented. It went up, partially, because people expected them to have great earnings. The earnings aren't a surprise. If anything, not having stellar earnings would be a surprise.

\- Stocks do not only go up. Again, Lowe's (just to use your example) has gone up an incredible amount. Do you just expect it to keep going up forever? I think that's the unrealistic part that catches so many redditors. They don't look at the charts from the past 5 years. They just buy and think ""it's doing good, it'll go up."" Markets are forward looking. The question isn't ""how well did Lowe's do in Q1 2021"" it's ""how well will Lowe's do in the next year or two."" And maybe it'll do well! But is that enough to justify another huge increase? Who knows? Would you, personally, keep paying more and more for it right now? Because the ""price"" isn't some objective measure. It is the most recent amount that someone sold for and someone bought for.

\- The market definitely has problems. But if you think it's ""corruption"" that your stock isn't going up, I really don't think you understand what the stock market is. ""Price"" isn't something owed to you or your company. It is, again, something someone else decides they will pay for your asset. There's all kinds of ways someone would decide how much they want to pay for Lowe's after this earnings. Again, did you see the earnings and decide to double-down yourself? Because that's basically what you're hoping someone others will do right now.

I don't mean to be unnecessarily harsh. And, sure, there are shady things in the market. But posts like this just seem to say ""I don't know what the stock market is"" a lot more than ""the stock market is broken.""",[],1

241,gyqoe64,2021-05-19,t1_gyqlyok,stocks,"Yes, but market cycles are something to consider regardless of the companies behind the stocks, sometimes it's better to wait for companies to prove earnings, and I was mainly referencing EV stocks, my mistake. It's a speculative space with a lot of competition. Also genomics is one that i had owned at points, but the consensus from research I've done is that genomics is still far away from being used practically. There is nothing wrong with owning these stocks now, but it's just not where the money will flow, and as a beginner investor, it can be very hard to watch your good stocks get hammered in times like these. 

I do believe that the things you've mentioned 100% have a future, but there are so many companies and stocks that just won't make it in those spaces, to invest in things like EV or solar or robotics, I would stick to ETFs until there are clear winners in the space, and then I would pick stocks based on those results. I understand your frustrations, but I've been in this game a while and timing isn't everything for the long, the last thing you want to do is try and time a bottom for a falling knife. I prefer to play those spaces safely, ex, instead of buying EV stocks that are overvalued still, buy the lithium miners, which will benefit from the entire movement. 

You're timeline is appropriate for what you hold, but many beginners that started in the past year have had a hard time learning the lessons that no matter the greatness of a company, the stock may not be priced correctly or have good investor sentiment based on the numbers and earnings. Also inflation is a very real risk to a lot of speculative companies. I was trying to give OP a safe way to play as to not dissuade him from playing the market if he were to pick speculative stocks and lose money. I know if you're long long term, it's less of a worry, but everybody says that until they're down 50% and don't know what to do. 

Sorry for the misunderstandings, I don't intend to argue. Everybodies timeline and investment styles are different, I just found that yours is riskier short to medium term and is probably not the best for a beginner, even though I have a feeling you are a beginner. The goal is to not lose money I thought, and that's the guidance I was trying to give to OP instead of, catch falling knives and wait 10 years for recoveries. I was explaining the market cycle and environment we are currently in. But you seem to know all about it.",[],1

If you see, that they didn't give the slightest shit that their stock price fell to the bottom of the recession and still paid out the same dividend five years ago, and then later you see it slightly rise, then that is a consistent dividend. 3-4% should be fine, if you see the dividend raise over time slowly, that means the % of gains you make on whatever you invested in will increase later also.

Perhaps when your stock collapses, as everyone sells off in a panic that armeggedon is near, you will remember the dividend stays consistent and reinvest where you will make a higher percentage yearly yield.

In general, you have to be careful about purchasing stocks with inflated P/E ratios, especially if they’re trading above a stock’s traditional P/E range. You can use a site like macrotrends to check this.

Even if a company is growing at an exceptional rate, you still need to look over their financial statements and attempt to identify the intrinsic fair value of the company today. There are a variety of methods you can employ to do this, with some being more involved than others.

In general, tech is still overvalued imo. However, my conviction and the degree depends entirely on the specific stock. If you could share a couple of the tickers you were looking for, maybe you can receive more focused advice.",[],0

Bought the absolute bottom, sold the top of the first stimulus pump, then bought the bottom again a week later. Turned 15k into like 40k in like a month. Pretty darn proud of that. Made the stupid mistake of holding those longer than I should as they traded sideways for months costing me deeply in oppourtunity cost. After that I went balls deep into very aggressive swing trading on margin. Just so happened to do that a month before the vaccine announcement in October which meant like 50% profits in a month. Made tons off MA, SJM, LADR, AMZN, and NET. Bought a ton of HD and FB during the February corrections and would have made like 100k had I held those bad boys but I got impatient and only made like 15k I think(doubt I would have held that far anyways oh well). Almost lost my ass on ICLN and NET but my spidey sense was screaming at me to sell so I did. I did buy gee em ee at 16 and had I held that about a month I'd be a millionaire, but chickened out and lost 10k instead. Sucks to suck I guess lol. All in all my overly aggressive trading paid off handsomely, but now I want to preserve that wealth.

>If you don't mind me asking what are your plays or are you still trying to figure it out?

Currently all cash for the last month or two. Did some light trading for funsies the other day and made 2k but otherwise I dunno anymore. Cash is trash, but all my favorites have all run up, even the indexes. Were I to put my money in I'd say Visa/MA would be the safest bets while still being aggressive. They have by far the sexiest long term chart I've seen in terms of stable growth with enough volatility to make a profit swing trading, and I'm speculating their mix of growth and value ensures a sort of internal hedging regardless of how the economy goes, but what the hell do I know I'm not a macroeconomist. I'd love to buy AMD but every time I look at it that 50% runup that's practically a vertical line back in june 2020 really worries me, like it'll just collapse the second I buy it.

Weeding out paperhanded bitches who have so much money they never have to actually step foot in a Lowes store to find out for themselves how much better in every way they are than Home Depot. It's really not hard to figure out, did you even check the short interest?

If stocks with $150B market caps are able to be manipulated like you think that is a problem with WAAAAAAY too many speculators vs actual investors. THAT is what you need to be concerned with, and that's an issue with the overall market right now, not any one particular ticker. I get the rant, but earnings plays are really low hanging fruit that any simp can do if they have about 45 minutes to listen to some overpaid prick talk on a shitty VOIP.

Do your own DD, which it seems like you did, and knew well enough to not step on a landmine setting itself up for a juicy short. So what if it some bullshit pharma company went up today? What if it goes down even harder tomorrow? Wouldn't you look silly ranting about things that go up on speculation today, and down for the same reason tomorrow?

If you don't understand casino market dynamics, the best bet is to not play. Of course isn't a casino, and anyone who tells you that is either a butthurt moron who buys mutual funds, or a liar trying to hustle you. Wall Street right now is a digital ghetto where hedge fund crackheads are chasing every gain they can because the free money supply is gone, they bought too much crack too high and sold it too low, and their dealer wants his money. Bubble crack is what happens when powder goes up, and they want that magic gain powder more than Bubba wants to suck gasoline out of a dry Colonial pipeline so his truck nutz go brrr. If they can step on some and sling it back for a few bucks, they'll do it with theta crew. Game theory, all the way down. Did you see what happened to AAPL right before it's stellar Q1 report? 10% down in power hour. Apple, the company that always goes up! Why? Why didn't it go 10% up? Because someone got called on GME...

Do you believe in the stock? Is it at a good price? Then buy it and forget about it! If it goes down buy more! It's full-court press hustle mode right now to get as much money out of retail as possible while throwing shade at nervous investors to make them flinch. Just like you said, earnings don't matter and that's the short term market outlook this year. Too much money fueling too much speculation. 2021 has a lot of smoldering embers after the brushfire of last year with massive amounts of money entering and moving toward gains gaining more gains. Lots of solid long term investment material is buried under massive short interest that couldn't be taken care of because the GME nuclear bomb got armed. If you are on the wrong side of that deal it's full-court press mode to rustle up enough cash to survive getting called. If you are smart enough to search out heavily shorted tickers with great DD and want to sit on them as investments, you'd be pretty damn smart right about now. I got a gold mine I've been watching with 1700% short interest that's gonna be melting ingots in Q4 and has 25% more gold than they originally thought, giving them a 10 year supply. And someone just wrote calls!

The market is massively overleveraged, every boring investment ticker is overpriced, and money isn't coming in because investors simply don't have any more money they can squeeze from the labor force, or are getting ready to buy the dip by riding the bond rocket. Bonds are going crazy, more than justified by the rate increase or speculation on further increases; same dynamics at play. Where is more money going to come from for stocks? Main Street is in the shitter and folks don't have money to support realistic P/E ratio gains as it is! Meanwhile those stocks are already massively overpriced anyway because of hedge funds hustling each other and stealing from low-info paperhanded retailers to keep pumping overvalued reserve holdings to justify getting more and more leverage to keep hustling smaller gains. It's a positive feedback cycle that can only end when something breaks down.

The crack game here worked until retail bought all the crack on a block and put it in the paper. Now the cops are discussing watching the streets, the powder supply got tightened, and hustlers suddenly can't afford to sling anymore. What happens when crackheads can't get their crack? They rob and steal whatever isn't nailed down to pay for crack. And if they can't pay the crack broker back for what they already sold or smoked? Someone gets a bullet to the face. Don't be the guy catching the bullet. When you hear the music stop, find the nearest chair and bludgeon anyone trying to take it from you.

744,gyr2041,2021-05-19,t3_ngga8k,stocks,">Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting. Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, inducing fear and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines). This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.

Its closing below your trend line, but still closed above the 200 MA, and still has two strong support levels to blow through before going sub 100 (120 and 110) - What negative catalysts do you anticipate that send this down another 25%, through major support, and then the past even the psychological support which will happen at 100. Its just as likely we bounce off 120 and head back up as we do head down. We'll need an outside catalyst to decide which way this goes, and given the negative market we could get one, but again we still have two support levels to get through before your price target, I just don't see it. Instead of negative earnings or bad fundamentals, we could get good earnings and positive fundamentals.

This means that a lot of equity movement is driven by options activity as market makers hedge their positions. This also means that near the end of the day - and especially the week - these hedges unwind and resolve as a response to they day's activity. The popularity of options give so much more leverage to market participants, hence higher intraday volatility as well.

That's why the flurry of activities in the first and last hour of the market has bigger swings in recent times. Not only are those hours most active for equity traders, market hours are the only times most options can be traded.

The biggest question is if you think it's worth risking holding or not. If you sell, you will lose that initial investment and then you will have to reinvest elsewhere to get that money back.

Look into valuation multiples (Not P/E, more sophisticated ones that are less susceptible to 'game' - like EV/Rev., EV/EBITDA.. will be sector specific) & see how a company trades relative to true comps leading into earnings. So even if ones down, its compset could theoretically be more down -- this will give you an idea of how much is 'priced in' or also indicate relative over/under bought levels. 

At the end of the day the trickiest part to playing events is mainly in determining how many buyers of a specific sector has all their buying power already devoted to a stock in anticipation of earnings/events. For example, if everyone thinks earnings will be good and all investors buy in anticipation of it even with good earnings, a stock could drop bc who else is left to buy?

If they are nothing but a bunch of $100 teenagers acting like moral crusaders, why would you even care? A bunch of teenagers with $100 isn't going to effect the market in anyway, even if they all bought the same exact stock.

Or is it what you really hate is retail investors whose pockets are varied from $10 to $100k, or more even, thing about retail, literally anyone can be retail. Rich and poor a like. But its mostly regular folks who make up the bulk of retail.

And their moral agenda shouldn't bother you still. Not unless your a part of a HF or something. Why would it? It an agenda against the mega rich who got there by using the regular and poor guy's money to do it. Note not  an agenda against the rich in general, just the ones who manipulate the market and in the past have used countless dirty and even illegal methods to make a profit at the regular guys expense.

So get it right, we aren't JUST teenagers, some are, most of us are millennials I imagine though, with a bunch of zoomers in their early 20s who aren't teenagers.
