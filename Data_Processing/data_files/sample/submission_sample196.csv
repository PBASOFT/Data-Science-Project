19,2021-05-21,stocks,"Started trading options January. Read that entire thetagang wiki. Became obsessed and watched maybe 80 videos explaining the math. So please correct my thinking / rationale. 

I have a core position that I will never sell until 60 (+30 years from now). Consists of : AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, VTI, ARKK, ARKG, ARKF. Keep adding on 5% dips (except Arks). 
_______
Next: I have a few short positions. ARKK, ARKF and ARKG. More shares of the short than long because I am bearish in the short term and want to capitalize on my prediction. Once they dip some more, I will cover and reinvest all that profit back into my longs because I am bullish long term. 
_____
Options:

I have been using margin to sell weekly cash covered puts on TSLA for the past 6 weeks and have been collecting $250 a week. IV is close to 100% on the strikes so technically I’m IV-gang, but actually timevalue is high enough for the volatility of TSLA. Planning on continuing doing this. 

Then besides TSLA if there are fundamentally strong stocks that dipped 3-4 %, I like to sell weekly CSPs on those as well. So far it’s been AAPL, QQQ, SPY, MSFT. 

Total profit averaged each of the last 6 weeks from these is $300. Which to me is fantastic. 

Then I use this money to reinvest into my core - whoever/whenever dips. 

____

Conclusion / Strategy:

Core is sold when I retire. When core corrects, I buy more. Whenever the next black swan market crash occurs, core stays untouched. Don’t need the money and don’t care for short term tax. (Unless ofc my thesis in the fundamental of the stock changes, then I will plan to exit positions). 

Shorts/ Hedges: When any of my core positions start entering bubble-popping territory or are otherwise becoming overvalued, core stays untouched, but I will open small positions to short those core securities, and/or write calls andor buy puts. I hate buying puts but whatever makes most sense in that scenario. Once I’ve accumulated a “decent” amount, and I am no longer bearish, I close and reinvest back into the core. 

Options: I want to keep doing this every fuckin week man. $300 a week or even $200 a week is amazing money. That’s almost your entire food bill for a month. I invest typically 50% of each paycheck. And now I get to add more capital from these puts. And best of all, it’s mostly stress-free because I do choose strikes I am COMFORTABLE owning. I do need to migrate towards other stocks though besides blue chip tech.

Random thoughts:

-/ not trying to sound naive / nonchalant that it’s fully risk free. But then again I’m not chasing $10 premiums. I’m targeting the $2-$3 range. 

-/ sometimes when the premium is crappy , I’ll extend TDE but then exit early once I reach profit goal. And then I can sell more. 

-/ someone surely is going to ask why I’m selling naked puts on margin.  It’s naked because the cash is in the bank. It’s margin because I can spend more. I understand the risks and I have capital in the bank and I appreciate your thoughtful concerns :)

367,2021-05-21,stocks,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 21, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) declining modestly after yesterday’s rally. It’s encouraging to see the market holding on to yesterday’s gains following the volatility experienced in recent weeks. It seems overall market sentiment is improving following a surge in inflationary fears after the release of the April Consumer Price Index. The SPY closed 0.08% down, the QQQ closed 0.56% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.36% up.

Markets have recently been shaken by the prospect that a rise in inflation may prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. However, as has been reiterated in the recap before, there are several reasons why a change in monetary policy seems very unlikely. In the Federal Reserve’s April meeting minutes, “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals”.  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered. The April Job Reports showed only 266,000 jobs added back to the economy, widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March, bolsters that argument.

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also noted “a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.

**Highlights**

* Shares of Nvidia (NVDA), one of the leading semiconductor companies, jumped after the company announced a 4-1 split. This means that after the split goes through, every share of  NVDA will become 4 and the price will adjust accordingly.
* In the midst of surging prices, the housing market has begun showing signs of slowing down. Today, the National Association of Realtors showed that existing home sales fell 2.7% in April compared to the month prior. That is well below the expectation of 1% growth and may be a sign the rise in prices may be slowing in the near-term. However, compared to April 2020, existing home sales are up 33.9%.
* Snap (SNAP) said it will acquire WaveOptics, a British Augmented Reality company, for over $500 million. The company has recently been making a big push into the world of wearable AR technology.
* China's internet watchdog said on Friday that companies including ByteDance, Baidu, and Microsoft (MSFT) improperly collected user data in the country.
* Yesterday, the US Department of Treasury announced it was taking steps to crackdown on digital assets by requiring any transfer worth $10,000 or more to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
* China’s Financial Stability and Development Commission, which is chaired by Vice Premier Liu He, released a statement today saying it is necessary to “crack down on digital asset mining and trading behavior and resolutely prevent the transmission of individual risks to the social field.”

Here is my question. 

I have a Roth IRA through Vanguard. I chose the Target Retirement 2050 fund. I am able to max this out every year. I wanted to start investing more and opened an account with Merrill. My  plan, so far, is:

60% ETF’s 
Within that 60%, 50% is growth and 50% is speculative.

40% Individual Stocks
Within that 40%, 50% growth and 50% speculative. 

Question 1.) Is this a good plan? I have a tendency to overthink and over complicate things. 

Question 2.) For my growth ETF positions, I already have some shares of VTI. Is this position redundant since my Roth IRA is Vanguard Target Retirement 2045(which I max out.) From what I can read, the 2045 target retirements holdings are 50% VTI. If it is redundant, would anyone happen to have a recommendation for growth ETF that would offer different exposure.

Also, for those who’ve invested for several years, have there been any stocks from your past that fit this category? If so, what did you eventually do with those stocks?

I’m only less than two months into my investing journey, so take what I say with a grain of salt, but my top three so far are…

3) MA - Talk about a stock that swings wildly. At its peak, MasterCard was as high as +300 for me. At its bottom, it fell to almost -200. Right now it’s sitting at around -100. I saw MA’s chart before I bought, and I noticed the wild price swings, but I also saw the general upward trend of higher highs and lows, which is why I’m not worried about its ability to eventually recover again.

2) SBUX - The stock was climbing from the moment I bought it…until its earnings report. Then it recovered. Then it didn’t. Yet despite its ridiculously high P/E ratio, it’s Starbucks. Its brand is as loud as Coca-Cola or Disney. I doubt it stays down for long.

1) OPY - When I was trying to find undervalued stocks, Oppenheimer’s numbers made it an attractive buy. Then the recent panic over inflation hit, and OPY wasn’t immune from the fall. Still, all indicators point to it being undervalued, and it’s already shown the ability to recover at least once. It seems as though I just got in at a bad time.",ni8fp6,[],0
