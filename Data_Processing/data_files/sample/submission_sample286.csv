101,2021-05-24,investing,"What will be the effect on the crypto markets with the introduction of meme coins like MILF TOKEN (source:[https://www.livecoinwatch.com/price/MILFFinance-\_MILF](https://www.livecoinwatch.com/price/MILFFinance-_MILF)) or DOGEcoin?  


As more speculative investment vehicles like DOGE or MILF coins become more common, will the crypto currency ever gain legitimacy? Will they ever uproot gold as a store of value or hedge against inflation?   


Cathie Wood Said this week, after BITCOIN crashed, that she STILL thinks Bitcoin will reach $500K. I don't know if she means in her lifetime but that would put bitcoin's market cap equal to that of Gold's, Essentially, she believes GOLD will be replaced by BITCOIN as a store of value .... despite its evident volatility and speculative nature.   


Is the newly created MILF COIN (source:[https://www.livecoinwatch.com/price/MILFFinance-\_MILF](https://www.livecoinwatch.com/price/MILFFinance-_MILF)) a sign of the future of this asset class?",njp0xv,[],0
124,2021-05-24,investing,"Liquified natural gas, LNG, is one of the world's fastest growing fuel sources. Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

Recently the company became debt free and is in the process of finalizing commercial deals with buyers.  These deals will be announced within a few weeks according to their CEO.

The content it has is already rated top notch but the merger also drops content made by Lebron James, his personal trainer, and even Arnold Schwarzenegger. 

I've been personally stacking up shares for 3 months now and have an extremely positive outlook on their future. With their heavy investors like Shaq I can see this company hitting $75 a share in the next couple years. End of year I expect it to be $20 at least. 

Also the nutritional side of their business plan seems to be fantastic as well with extremely high ROI. 

Plus they have zero debt and over $300 million in liquid cash. Which is fantastic for two older companies. Already a tried and true buisness for both parties.

324,2021-05-24,investing,"I'm a new investor looking for companies that are both growing and paying dividends. In my search, I found a company called Arbor, which is a REIT with a very juicy dividend yield (7.86%). Usually, dividend yields this high are when the company stock falls due to a bad future outlook, and it's expected that the company might have to cut its dividends soon, but that's not the case here — $ABR has been steadily growing for years. 

I tried to read a bit more about this company, but I feel like I'm lacking the knowledge to understand what's it doing to be growing so much. It's a REIT that specializes in mortgages, but I thought this kind of stuff got less popular after 2008? Is it super risky?

It's not discussed very much on the internet, most articles I saw about it seem auto-generated from templates and mostly about the stock price (like [this one](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-arbor-realty-trust-abr-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-2021-03-17)). 

Some more useful info I found:

- [comparison of mREITs](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4398102-you-are-considering-mortgage-reits-you-must-read-this) on seeking alpha which does not discuss Arbor much, but other mREIT stocks it mentions (like $STWD, $BXMT, $ACRE, and $LADR) while having similar yield, don't have similar stock price growth;
- [this Q1 2021 call transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/07/arbor-realty-trust-abr-q1-2021-earnings-call-trans/) that I read but couldn't understand much of the terms used there. GSE? AIR? build-to-rent?
- I also had a look at their [2020 yearly report](https://ir.arbor.com/static-files/747cdfcd-0579-4126-8b1b-19ebec102cad), but I don't know how to read and understand that stuff properly... ""2020 numbers are better than 2019 numbers""?

393,2021-05-24,investing,"ICAGY's a stock I've watched since last year during the COVID downturn. All airlines fell but rose back to their normal levels EXCEPT for ICAGY. On paper, it seems pretty solid. It's a conglomerate of British Airways and Iberian Airways (the crown jewels of British and Spanish governments), and a few other budget and smaller-cap airlines. 

As far as I can tell, the only reason it hasn't risen is because European nations have had a much more difficult time recovering travel-wise. Different restrictions to countries, as well as the British government putting the United States on the red-list because of a high COVID danger, means that they can't generate as much revenue. 

I'm trying to understand what investors aren't seeing in ICAGY that they saw in companies like Jetblue and United? Well established airlines that are a little further in their recovery cycle than the U.S. ones, but can be just as strong when a recovery is finished. I don't think the British or Spanish governments are going to let their flagship airlines go under. Help me. What am I not seeing here?",njunge,[],0

543,2021-05-24,investing,"Investors should ride through volatility in the crypto space by buying shares of Coinbase, according to Goldman Sachs.

Analyst Will Nance initiated coverage of the cryptocurrency exchange on Monday with a buy rating, saying in a note to clients that Coinbase is the best way to gain exposure to cryptocurrency ecosystems.

Coinbase went public through a direct listing on April 14 and, after an initial pop, its shares have struggled. The stock rose above $400 during that first day of trading, but on Friday closed near $224.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/24/coinbase-stock-initiation-goldman-sachs.html

More from SA

* Goldman Sachs analyst Will Nance initiates coverage of Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) with a Buy rating partly on its business model that ""thrives on elevated cryptocurrency volatility.""
* That volatility has been on display in recent weeks as seen in crypto swings as evidenced in bitcoin's wild ride. This morning bitcoin rises to $37.6K but had dropped as low as $31.1K on Sunday.
* COIN stock rises 3.0% in premarket trading.
* Sets price target at $306; implies a 36% upside potential for stock based on Friday's closing price of $224.35.
* Nance also likes COIN's leverage to an ecosystem with strong growth driven by increasing adoption of digital currencies, its consumer platform with strong customer acquisition trends and rapidly growing institutional business, and its opportunities to add additional features and capabilities.
* Though the continued success or failure of crypto as an asset class will ultimately determine COIN's future, ""we believe COIN represents a blue-chip way through with to invest in the development of the ecosystem,"" the analyst writes.
* Points to COIN's careful approach to regulatory compliance, crypto-native technology stack, and role as an innovation hub for new crypto endeavors.
* Nance's Buy rating is more optimistic than the average SA Author's rating of Neutral (6 Bullish, 5 Neutral, 2 Bearish) and aligns with the average Wall Street rating of Bullish (6 Very Bullish, 1 Bullish, 4 Neutral).
* Last week, Coinbase snagged an Outperform rating at Wedbush helped by its ""first mover"" advantage.

696,2021-05-24,investing,"According to BofA's monthly Global Fund Manager Survey published last Tuesday, ""higher inflation is now the consensus."" And furthermore ""inflation is now again the biggest risk for markets,"" as initially identified by 35% of the survey's 194 respondents who manage a combined $592 billion worth of assets. But if investors are broadly concerned about inflation, it suggests stock prices are likely already reflecting these risks and investors have discounted, or priced in, inflation risk into the markets. While it may not be a perfect analog, it's worth considering what happened during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. 

On March 17, 2020, BofA's Global Fund Manager Survey identified ""Coronavirus"" as its biggest tail risk, and it remained on the top fo the list for the next 10 months as data consistently and persistently reflected an economy in a state of emergency. But the S&P 500 prices bottomed on March 23, 2020. 

In other words, the market had priced in the coronavirus recession and discounted the pandemic's worst financial impacts by mid-March, but this risk still remained the consensus worry among investors for another year. 

The threat of inflation is the most known risk in the markets right now. And so investors should consider the likelihood that the downside of inflation has been priced in.

""Unlike recent cycles, we acknowledge that inflation tail-risk is higher and that inflation data could get hotter before normalizing,"" JPMorgan's Dubravko Lakos-Bujas said. ""This outcome, at the same time, is getting increasingly priced-in as essentially every investor we have spoken to in recent weeks is well aware of this backdrop.""

According to Google, search interest in ""inflation"" is at an all-time high. The University of Michigan's recent survey of consumers revealed sentiment got dinged in May due to unusually elevated concerns about inflation in the years to come.

On the corporate side, a record number of S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies have discussed ""inflation"" on earnings calls as executives just can't stop talking about higher costs.

Whether or not inflation actually becomes a major problem for the economy will only be known in hindsight. And despite folks arguing that recent upticks in price represent ""transitory"" concerns and ""reopening quirks,"" this debate is likely to rage on for months especially as high-profile skeptics sound alarms.

873,2021-05-16,investing,"I am typically a value oriented investor and focus heavily on valuations.  Fundamentals on Google are sound: strong recurring revenue base, monopolistic tendencies, value add to customer, network effects, cross selling across revenue streams etc.  I find it hard to argue that Google is going anywhere anytime soon.

Valuation wise, many think that FAANG is overpriced.  Some of it is.  Google trades at a whopping 37x earnings! But only 24x forward.  And only 15x fwd EV/EBITDA.  That is the metric I will focus on for now as I tend to use DCF models with EV/EBITDA terminal values.  The average EV/EBITDA multiple over the last 10 years is about 16x.  The lowest was 10x and 10x is the lowest it ever traded since IPO.  Using a DCF model and using ultra bear scenario of the following assumptions: 2022-2025 revenue growth of 0% annually (yes, correct),  gross margins of 55% (below the 10 year average of 60%), operating margin of about 23% (10 year average 25%), D&A constant at 8% of revenue, Capex in line with Bloomberg estimates approx 16-17% of revenue, and change in NWC of about -3% (consistent with last 4 years).  WACC is 9.5% and used a 10x exit multiple.  This estimates an intrinsic value of $2068, about -9% from current values.  And that is the bear case with ultra bearish assumptions.

The base case then with revenue growth of 10%, same margins, higher depreciation based on consensus estimates, and an exit multiple of the 10 year average of 16x yields a price of $4831, upside of 112%.

Of course, I never truly depend on a DCF model to provide an exact price because there are so many assumptions that will never play out as expected, but it is a great tool to identify what factors impact price and some worst case scenarios.  It is further evidence to me that Google is one of the most undervalued large caps with a wide moat around its largest product, expanding its range and interconnectivity of its products constantly, and generating a significant amount of cash in the meantime.

Let me know your thoughts.

Edit: Cant disagree more with the Mod post below.  EV/EBITDA is a widely accepted method of DCF analysis especially when comparing firms with varying amounts of leverage.  EV/EBITDA is a terminal multiple used to estimate a value for the company at the end of the forecasting period.  The forecasting period still uses FCFF.
