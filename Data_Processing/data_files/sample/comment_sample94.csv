Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.

Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.","['GME', 'AMC']",1

 My reply:



Some will not.  But IMO it is not realistic to make every single short in all of GME to cover.  I also don't share your opinion of the magnitude of naked shorting going on.

1376,gzne4l5,2021-05-27,t3_nmad7v,wallstreetbets,"In a market that‚Äôs gone quiet, meme stocks are back to provide investors with a daily source of entertainment.

With Memorial Day approaching and catalysts nowhere in sight, the overall market has ground to a halt. The S&P 500 has risen just 0.4% in May, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up a touch more than 1%. The Nasdaq is down 1%. What‚Äôs more, the indexes have been stuck in place‚Äîrising, falling, and ultimately going nowhere.


Enter the meme stocks. GameStop has jumped more than 30% this week, while AMC Entertainment has soared 62%. And other stocks, including Express and Koss, have joined the party. If watching the market has become akin to watching paint dry, the meme stocks are akin to blasting it with a flamethrower to see if it will dry faster.


For anyone not involved in the trade, it‚Äôs pure entertainment. Watching the stock market go nowhere can make bulls question their bullishness, and bears question their pessimism. It‚Äôs trying to find meaning in nothing.

There is no meaning deeper message about the economy embedded in the meme stock moves‚Äîthey‚Äôre detached from fundamentals. Analyst reports on the companies are beside the point. It‚Äôs all supply and demand.

So it brings a sense of disappointment to see GameStop down 2% in premarket action Thursday, and AMC off 3%. On another quiet day in the market, we need the meme-trade distraction.

It's plainly obvious that AMC has been on the precipice of collapse for months now... And if you look at their financials you'll see this isn't just me being crazy - the numbers actually show it quite plainly. They've been bleeding cash for months now, even though their revenues have been growing exponentially every quarter. There are no numbers anywhere supporting any hope for long-term survival here.... We're talking about bankruptcy here, folks... They can only survive by bleeding out as many coins as possible while selling all of those TIX coins they have already mined without spending them yet (that's why all those ""free"" TIX are locked up inside ""lockboxes"" - they're keeping them off the market so you can't buy more tickets). They might be able to hold out until summer next year before bankruptcy occurs, but after this upcoming shareholder meeting then we'll see some major changes made by new management - including laying people off en masse or canceling shows completely (they've already canceled several shows). You heard me right: AMC STOCK IS GOING TO ZERO! This entire business model has failed miserably! The stock price is going straight into fucking oblivion FAST!

Your broker is ""loaning"" you that money because obviously you're good for it (it's already in the process of settling) 

First Trade:

""You may also trade in a margin account with your own cash. No extra interest or fees will be charged if you do not borrow money from Firstrade or exceed your cash buying power. Trading in a margin account would allow you to use unsettled funds; this will avoid all the settlement date related violations that could happen in a cash account.""

Robin Hood:

""All customers start out with an Instant account, which is a margin account, so that they can access funds before they've settled and enter options trades if they're approved. Even if you've never borrowed money in your account, this account type is still classified as a ‚Äúmargin‚Äù account from a regulatory standpoint.""

Webull:

""Cash accounts do not offer leverage, and you can only trade with settled funds.""

Before January of this year not at all. Since then it's been taken over by self-coined ""apes"" who pride themselves in pumping up companies that have been shorted

>If so how do i get in on it? how do you decide dying companies?

Look at the 5 year chart and it's pretty easy to see which ones are dying. The apes don't care about fundamentals or the actual business at all though. All they care about is what percentage of the float is shorted.

> What are the rules of investing? How much do i invest? What kind of platform do i use?

Only invest what you can afford to lose. Assume what you've put in is already gone before you decide to jump in. There are tons of platforms to choose from and robinhood is the most noob friendly but the apes here HATE it. Robinhood, fidelity, td ameritrade, tastyworks are all fine. 

>when do you sell if ever? How do you make money if you don't sell? Why not find a small company and make it skyrocket?

This is where the biggest issue is. Don't EVER take advice from the spammers on this sub or any other. It's in their best interest to convince others to keep buying and never sell. That's not in YOUR best interest. This same scheme has been going on for years in the crypto industry with constant pump and dump schemes with bots and hype and HODL and NEVER SELL ONLY BUY spam. It's done with purpose - to make YOU the bagholder with soon-to-be worthless shares of something because you bought at the peak of the hype and spam. 

You can hop on one of these pump and dump schemes if you want, but be ready to sell as soon as you have decent profit. If you're already up, set limit sells for if the price drops from there. 

Why don't they find a small company and make it skyrocket? Because the hive mind is incredibly simple and largely unfocused. It's entirely decided by social media hype and bots. The early ""apes"" latched onto the idea that they were not involved in some pump and dump scheme, but instead fighting a righteous fight against hedge funds and people who short stocks (neither of which is inherently bad). Because of this they've mostly stuck to the first two companies that got wrapped up in this whole thing, GME and AMC. Occasionally other stocks will become meme stocks and get the same treatment to a smaller degree.","['GME', 'AMC']",1

**Myovant and Pfizer's uterine fibroids med scores FDA nod, setting up showdown with AbbVie**

**by Noah Higgins-Dunn | May 26, 2021 5:31pm**

The FDA approved Myovant's relugolix, marketed as Myfembree, to help women manage heavy menstrual bleeding linked to uterine fibroids. (Myovant Sciences)

Fresh off the back of Myovant Sciences‚Äô first FDA win for relugolix in prostate cancer late last year, the Swiss pharma can now add a second indication to its flagship drug's resume.

The U.S. FDA on Wednesday approved Myovant‚Äôs relugolix in combination with two hormone drugs as the first once-daily treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding linked to uterine fibroids in premenopausal women, with a treatment duration for up to two years. The drug will be marketed as Myfembree.

Uterine fibroids are noncancerous tumors that develop in the uterus. They're among the most common reproductive tract tumors in women, Myovant says, and can cause serious symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, abdominal bloating and, in some cases, infertility.

They can be treated with birth control to address bleeding and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, which can shrink fibroids. Patients with more severe symptoms may need surgery.

Millions of women in the U.S. are affected by uterine fibroids, which account for over 250,000 hysterectomies each year, Myovant CEO Dave Marek said.

Myovant predicts roughly 19 million women in the U.S. have uterine fibroids, although only a quarter of those women, or about 5 million, will experience symptoms and seek care from a physician, Marek said. About 3 million will fail on first-line treatments, he added. The company's immediate goal will be to target those patients.

""We are going to need to do education to get (women) to know that there are options for them and that what they're having is not normal, and that there's something to do about it,"" Myovant Chief Medical Officer Juan Camilo Arjona Ferreira said in an interview.

RELATED: Myovant leans on new partner Pfizer as it dives into first launch for cancer drug Orgovyx

Wednesday's approval marks the second FDA nod for Myovant in less than a year after relugolix scored a go-ahead in prostate cancer in December, sold as Orgovyx. The company is also testing its flagship drug in women with endometriosis, another painful disorder involving the uterus‚Äôs tissue, and as a pregnancy prevention medication.

Pfizer will help Myovant sell Myfembree for uterine fibroid patients in the U.S. as early as June. The pharma giant doled out $650 million upfront plus sweeteners last year to get a piece of the drug, which launched in prostate cancer patients in early 2021.

""We are shifting from a development stage company to a commercial stage company,"" Marek told Fierce Pharma. ""A key part of that was finding a partner in Pfizer that has tremendous strength, not only in prostate cancer but also in women's health.""

But Myfembree will have to battle against AbbVie and Neurocrine Biosciences‚Äô already standing Oriahnn (elagolix) for a slice of the uterine fibroid market.

After receiving the FDA‚Äôs clearance to help treat heavy menstrual bleeding in women with uterine fibroids nearly a year ago, AbbVie's med has a sizable head start. Oriahnn, which is approved for both uterine fibroids and endometriosis, raked in $121 million in U.S. sales for the Illinois pharma in 2020.

For Myovant's part, it has not provided any forecasts into potential revenues, Marek said. However, Myovant believes physicians will favor the convenience of its once-daily pill versus the twice-daily pill from AbbVie.

A bottle of 28 Myfembree tablets will cost about $975 before rebates, according to an SEC filing.

RELATED: Myovant's uterine fibroid med hits the mark in 2nd phase 3 trial

The FDA based its Myfembree approval on two replicate phase 3 trials‚Äîdubbed LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2‚Äîthat showed the med significantly beat placebo in preventing blood loss among women with uterine fibroids. Specifically, 72.1% and 71.2% of women in the relugolix arm responded to the treatment compared with 16.8% and 14.7% of women in the placebo groups after 24 weeks, respectively.

In its approval, the FDA warned the drug shouldn‚Äôt be used for longer than 24 months due to risk of continued bone loss that may not be reversible.

6517,gzno81e,2021-05-27,t1_gzm8912,wallstreetbets,"It's actually selling calls, and it uses your leaps as collateral instead of shares. So for example let's say you sold a call at a strike price of $25. Let's also pretend that AMC is trading above $25, so whoever you sold that call to is going to exercise it. So they exercise their call at $25, which then auto-exercises your LEAPS at $12 per share, and then gives you the strike width, or the difference between the strikes. So in this specific case you'd be left with $1300 (the difference between what you paid to exercise the LEAPS versus what you got paid for the shares) plus whatever premium you got paid to sell that covered call.


OR another scenario is AMC never hits $25 and the call you sold expires worthless, so you get to just keep the premium you sold the covered call for, PLUS you get to keep your LEAPS so you can just write more covered calls again and receive more premium. Theoretically, if you did this enough, and received enough premium, you could bring your cost basis low enough for that LEAPS that it's almost free. And at that point you'll just be playing with house money.


Of course there IS a downside to this strategy, which is: if you sell a call at $25 and amc goes to $35 the same day, you're gonna lose out on the gains from $25 to $35. Whatever you sell your call at will cap your gains (or at least theoretically ""cost you money"", you could still roll your covered call out and up but that's another lesson for another time), so if your underlying randomly moons and you have a covered call out you can miss part of those gains. 


If you're more interested in this strategy and want to learn more, using a LEAPS as collateral for writing covered calls is called a ""poor man's covered call"". InTheMoney on YouTube has a great video on the PMCC, and KamikazeCash does as well.",['AMC'],0

Yes, asking people to hold.

Because they don't want other people to sell.

Because when they sell, the price goes down
