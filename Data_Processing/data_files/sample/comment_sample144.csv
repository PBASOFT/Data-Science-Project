25,gz8fs9z,2021-05-24,t1_gz7sjjl,investing,"So I decided to check if Berkshire has underperformed the S+P for a decade. 

It has a beta of 0.88 which has been fairly consistent, and a return of 13.84% compared to the S+P's return of 14.3% over the last decade. Given a 10-year treasury rate that implies and alpha of 1.06, so pretty good so far. 

10-year standard deviation of S+P is 14.04%, giving it a respectable sharpe ratio of .94. 

10-year sharpe of Berkshire is 0.87

The SPY worst 3-mo performance was -19.53%, whereas the worst 3-mo performance for BRK was -19.28%. The worst 1-year performance of the last 10 for SPY was -6.99, where berkshire's worst was -16.26%. 

Given that BRK has a value tilt, and the overall performance of value over the past decade, and that he does operate with a lower beta than the market BRK has done pretty average over the last decade. We have definitely seen some style drift from BRK over the years, and its days of significant consistent outperformance are likely long in the rearview mirror.

The covariance of BRK with the S+P seems to be rising over time. My gut says that BRK is getting pushed out of mid-cap and small-cap value in part due to its size. They have too much money, and not enough places they are willing to deploy it. They have a market value likely in significant excess to their holdings, and they are getting dragged away from their original mandate and core competency",[],0

They also aren't a NY firm: Baltimore based but with a few International locations. 

IMO the hardest thing to do is to concentrate on growth companies and not getting blown up during market corrections, and that's what they manage to nail down. Value investing is much easier by comparison...just buy low PE companies with low debt. T Rowe is not a value shop. 

T Rowe New Horizons is a good example of this. Mostly invests in growthy tech/health type stuff but they've beaten their index for over 20 years and yet again they've managed not to get pulverized this year so far while funds like ARK are in pain.

Japan Fund is another one, been around since 1991...perservered through Japan's big recession. 

The other thing is if a fund starts to get successful, they pretty much always close it to new investors to protect their existing clients. You can't get into any of their good funds anymore. 

Note that they aren't always a slam dunk. Their Eastern Europe and Middle East fund have done terrible IMO because you can't deliver alpha in a country when it's run by crooks.

Second, addiction is a more complex problem than merely bad decision making.  If you don't treat the underlying problem, you'll look elsewhere for that same dopamine rush.

This is the kind of thing addicts in recovery romanticize and reminisce about, and it's this mindset that leads to relapse.

Real investing is boring.   The thing that concerns me is I sense that you're not asking me, ""How do I get boring?""

A long time compared to our lifetimes, for sure! 

But the whole idea of value outperforming is predicated on a paradigm shift re rates: if rates go bearish, value outperforms. Value bulls have called for value to outperform on the belief that there'd be some sort of rate-rise, which we just didn't see since the full-on fever-pitch Value evangelism of 2012-ish.

If you held growth through that entire period, you came out on top. But you could get the opposite effect extending the time horizon another decade.

Point is, the 'debate' is about the next regime shift; not the average results over multiple regimes.

I've seen this line of reasoning a pop up a few times now and it's intriguing. Let me ask a counter-question: 

You equate the dividend payment to selling shares. I don't love this description but I will try to work on wrapping me head around it. Even so, in reality I *haven't* sold any shares, and more to the point, with my dividend payment I will actually buy more share to increase my share count. Over the course of 20 years, I may go from an initial position of 100 shares to 350 shares by re-investing the dividends. So in sum, my gains will include:

1) Share appreciation over timeframe of 20 years (my assumption here is that most will hold steady/increase with the markets in general over such a long time frame)

2) Inflated share count compared to initial position (delta = today's position - principle position)


A second line of thought:

You mention that paying a dividend is like selling shares. Well theoretically you could only do this so many times before running out of. For example, let's say the stock is $20. It pays a dividend of $1. Now it is ""worth"" $19. Next quarter it pays out another dollar. Now it is ""worth"" $18... so on and so forth. How does the logic here hold?

In spite of what Buffett recommends, I don't think it's a good idea.   [Ben Felix does a great job of explaining why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR7e1Y-HJxQ&ab_channel=BenFelix), but here are my thoughts:

The S&P 500 has had an incredible decade, but [there have been times when international stocks have done better](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/files/5myths_intl_2016_chart2.jpg).   So ideally you want both, which you do.

Just comparing the total US and total international indexes....International stocks held in broadly diversified funds will usually give you more exposure to different sectors (financials, energy, industrials, materials) vs the US stocks that are heavily weighted in tech, healthcare, and consumer discretionary stocks.  The international stock index is also made up of smaller companies with lower PE's (value stocks).  These are two risk factors that historically do well for investors with long time horizons.   In short, global diversification is a good thing and that's why your SOFI accounts do it for you.",[],1

You simply cannot achieve these kinds of returns without occasionally seeing large drawdowns and underperformance.

Now to answer your question. My problem with her isn’t with woods herself. It’s with the way people talk and act about her. How they act like she is the next warren buffet because she had two years of outperformance. The rest of the time she was pretty much just flat. I’m not a huge buffet fanboy who thinks nobody can compare to him, or that anything but value investing is a losing strategy, but it should be no secret that I think her strategy is trash. I saw a graph comparing her performance to an ETF of none profitable companies, and it’s the same. She literally only care about growth, if the company is growing she doesn’t care how trash it otherwise is, and I have a hard time seeing how this strategy can be as consistent as real investing.

Now I could live with her having a different strategy. If that’s what people want, that’s all fine, but she ain’t even taking herself seriously. When she put out her bear case for Tesla I lost all respect for her. It was a joke. Her bear case had a higher price target than the current price, and everyone with a brain, including herself, know that’s not the bear case for Tesla. Yet she presented it as if it was a serious bear case. The way I view her is that she was at the right place at the right time. She got lucky that her strategy happened to work in this environment.

353,gz98xzl,2021-05-24,t3_njnk09,investing,"As far as currency risk affecting your USD-denominated returns is concerned, your portfolio is probably well suited to mitigate it. If the USD weakens, your international allocations will benefit. It gets a bit more complicated when talking about converting back to your home currency. Vanguard has done some research about currency risk’s contribution to the volatility of returns and found that it doesn’t predictably increase or decrease volatility. Over the observed period, unhedged portfolios had lower volatility than hedged portfolios in the US and UK, but higher than in Canada and Australia. So currency hedging may not meaningfully mitigate that risk. Increasing your domestic allocation would meaningfully reduce volatility associated with exchange rates, but you’re then essentially changing your entire investment strategy and betting much bigger on your home country’s market. I can’t say whether that’s a good or a bad thing, I am not familiar enough with the Philippine’s market to say. I would start by looking at the volatility of your domestic market (as denominated in PHP). If it’s much more volatile than VTI/VXUS, you might just be trading one driver of volatility for another.

I wouldn't know why investors do not seem to like ICAGY as much as other (especially US airlines), but here some food for your thoughts and evaluations:

* Europe is behind the US in vaccination, the majority of EU countries won't finish their vaccination before August/September. That of course reduces margins for recovery of airlines and other tourism-related business.
* It is expected that work travel for business meetings, fairs,  conventions, etc. will be impacted long-term. In Europe for medium-distance travel, fast railways are a viable alternative. Some governments such as France are also planning to ban domestic flights where a fast-train alternative exists for environmental reasons (of course this is France and not the UK or Spain, but it gives an idea of some policies floating around here in Europe).

* As part of the recovery plans approved by EU governments, there has been also some direct help for their main airlines. This has pushed some competitors to file suit to the EU General Court, as according to them these measures may infringe competition rules. In one case in particular the General Court sided with the plaintiff (Ryanair) against KLM (Dutch airline) and TAP (Portuguese airline). [Reuters article here](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/eu-court-backs-ryanair-challenge-klm-tap-state-aid-2021-05-19/). 
* Last but not least, Europe much stronger social protection for workers. That means that big companies such as Iberia could not simply lay off personnel in 2020 and wait for better times. The Antitrust approved the deal (to be completed this summer), it also demanded Iberia cede certain route slots they had in common with Air Europa to avoid creating quasi-monopoly for those routes. Moreover, Air Europa did receive more than € 400M in state aid last year and the Spanish government is still financing part of Iberia costs by contributing to personnel salaries (an employment protection instrument called ERTE in Spain). Competitors might asks the courts to assess whether those aids are still *kosher* given the merger.

To sum all this up, analysts think that air traffic won't resume its pre-pandemic volumes before 2024 here in Europe. I have no basis nor knowledge to assess how accurate these estimation may be.

My advice:
- Avoid wildfire risk states (West coast mainly) 
- Public utilities have the most to benefit IMO.
- NE had a great run but I think other utilities that have historically been a bit dirtier in their energy have more room to the upside.
- Avoid states with nasty politics against their energy space. California, NY are bad. NJ, Michigan, Midwest are good. All red states good.
- Best pick are companies that anchor lots of jobs to their city. They'll get lots of local support from govt. You need to understand that public utilities can only make as much $$$ as their municipality allows...so this is very important. 
- Don't discount a utility for having lots of debt. That's literally the name of the game...they need to take on debt to increase their asset base.

517,gz9nv4n,2021-05-24,t3_njwzvr,investing,"There is a lot that should be said/asked here, but I'll try to touch on some of the more important things. This might also be a good post for r/personalfinance depending on the feedback you get here (ex. if this gets removed).

I'm assuming you don't have any high-interest debt to pay off since that should take priority over maximizing retirement accounts. I would also assume you have some sort of emergency fund in place outside of these retirement funds and the funds you're trying to invest. However, your question of ""what if one day I need to take money out of the taxable"" makes me second-guess this. In theory, you should have an emergency fund available with enough saved up to cover a couple months of expenses, and that would ""shield"" you from having to take out of the taxable.

That also ties in with your question about taxes. If you only invest and never sell/withdraw, then your tax exposure should be minimal. Holding stocks does not create a taxable event, but selling them does (along with any dividends or capital gains disbursements). When selling, you are only taxed on your earnings (ex. if you invest $6k, it grows to $7k, and you sell it all, only $1k is taxable). Same with dividends... if you invest $6k and dividends are paid at say 2%, only those dividend payments are taxable ($6k*2% = $120 taxable).

I don't know how reliable the calculators are, I would guess some might be more reliable than others, and it probably depends a lot on your particular situation (how risky are the things you're invested in, how much you'll need, when you'll need it, etc.). I don't have all of your answers, but thought the info above was worth sharing.",[],1

I don’t have an employer that offer a 401k (I DoorDash and get veterans education benefits) but when I graduate and find a job I will contribute as much as possible. I understand the benefits of a Roth IRA but my hesitation is that I don’t know if it’s playing it too long term to invest in a Roth IRA instead of a standard brokerage account when I have every intention of maxing my 401k as soon as I get an employer that offers one.

However, if you are hell-bent on investing in an Index fund/ETF, then I would highly recommend that you ""Dollar Cost Average"" (DCA) into one.  Yo can do this by buying an equal dollar amount each time you make a purchase.  And I would recommend that you space out your purchases to give you a broad timeframe to reach full investment.

Example:

1) Make ""monthly"" purchases of the Index.

2) If the market corrects, you can accelerate your purchases in order to DCA your Cost Basis DOWN.

3) Make monthly purchases of between $3000$4000 so that you can spread your DCA over the next 24+ months.  This will likely give you the best chance of avoiding loss in the event of a near-term market correction.

So for most of that time period, the Fed has tended to focus primarily on the ""low inflation"" part of its mandate at the expense of the ""low unemployment"" part.

That led to an incredibly slow, sluggish economic recovery post-2008. People graduated from college unable to find jobs, and those who had jobs got very little by way of raises. The result was a populist backlash that led to millions of Americans embracing politicians like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders who promised to put people back to work and stick it to the ""elites"" whose policymaking decisions had left them out of work or poor.

Their Q1 2020 vs. Q1 2021 numbers tell the whole story. The key is they don't take a flat rate per trade/withdrawal etc, they take a  *percentage*. So bull = more profit, bear = less profit, all other things held equal.  
Also transacting users, rather than just a total number of users, rises to a huge degree in a bull market. They went from 34M users in Q1 2020 to 56M users in Q1 2021, so call it 60% user growth. But *transacting* users, those making at least one transaction per month, went from 1.3M in Q1 2020 to 6.1M in Q1 2021. So almost 5x due to the bull market. Trade volume also went from $30B to $89B in that span.  
Couple all that with BTC going from $6k or so to $60k or so across that one year span and you see why their profits went from $32M in Q1 2020 to $771M in Q1 2021. Those numbers can absolutely not be explained away by the increase in user base/transacting users, it also largely comes from the price of the assets being significantly higher.

To your point about the price dropping after dividend payment, but my understanding is that the following cycle typically plays out for dividend paying stocks:

1) Stock rises prior to strike date to ""true"" value level/price as everyone tries to get in on the dividend payment

2) Strike date elapses, and now that everyone has locked in the dividend payment, money rushes out and the price drops rapidly

3) Over the course of the next dividend cycle, stock price will rise back up and dovetail with Point #1 and reset the cycle

957,gzaicf4,2021-05-24,t1_gza4uor,investing,"There is plenty but it's all content that I pay for so nothing really I can link you. It's gonna be hard to explain why I'm confident it's going back up without writing an essay...but I'll give it a go. 

First of all while it was quite a substantial crash recently, it was not unexpected. I thought we'd be trading between 40-50k for a few months but instead it looks like we'll be between 30-40k. The growth so far this year was not sustainable. We were far too extended from the 20 week MA. Last cycle we rode it all the way up until a blow off top. The cycle before, in 2013, we got too far extended & when we finally tested it, we fell below it, that was the forming of the first peak in a double peak cycle. Then we had months of consolidation before blasting off again, reaching a blow off top & then a sustained bear market. 

A similar thing just happened. We were so far above the 20 week that when we tested it we fell below it. Falling below it means alt coins get wrecked. Part of the reason you see so much fear online & in r/cryptocurrency is because a surprising amount of people own no BTC & go all in on alts. Which is a terrible idea. When BTC drops significantly the alts get destroyed & people who thought they were getting rich quick start to panic because they're losing money badly. There are even more similarities between 2013 & now. The guy I mainly get my content off has been predicting a double peak cycle for months now & he's not the only one. The intra-cycle volatility between this cycle & the last has been very similar to what occurred between 2013 & the one before it, which is where the suspicions of a double peak originally came from & so far it's playing out. 

I realise all of this probably is worthless without charts so I'll move on.

The asset class is maturing & things are of course overvalued, but they're been way more overvalued at times in the past. There is very clearly diminishing returns & reduced volatility over time, but it's years off reaching a stage where it flattens out. The utility in crypto improves year after year & Blockchain is an industry disrupting technology for many industries. I'm not a bitcoin maximalist but I am a crypto maximalist & the likes of xxx, XXX & xxx are going nowhere for years to come. Most alts are worthless but during a bear market the ones that actually do something tend to be ridiculously undervalued (xxx at 2c last year now at 1.5 & previously well over 2, xxx at 0.002 last year now at 0.10 & previously at 0.28.)
Then in a bull market they get ridiculously overvalued. Overall the asset class reached I think a 4x from its previous cycle peak when BTC was at 60k. Even with diminishing returns that is well below what anyone predicted. There was also no blow off top which will come at some stage. A period where greed reaches its peak, instead we just put in new ATHs 3k above the previous for a few months before the crash.

II interest is not going away & has only been increasing in the past few months but what investor wants to buy a 60k BTC? The likes of Grayscale & MicroStrategy will, but their average buy is already way lower than most else & they're in it for the real long haul. To move to 100k IIs are needed & those who were interested but didn't act because the price is too high for an entry point. Now they've got a great entry point below the average buy of the likes of Tesla. 

I'm gonna stop now, I'm sure if you have no interest in crypto then it seems like nonsense rambling but if you see BTC hit 100k or more then know that during the bear market that follows, whenever it comes, you have a great opportunity to buy undervalued solid projects & make fantastic returns.

For exemple if you buy 10 shares of the German Bundesbank in the New York stock exchange your broker says you are exposed to dollars, if you buy 10 shares of the German Bundesbank in the German stock market it will say you are exposed to Euro.

Crypto has grown because knowledge of it grew. I got started with it in 2013 and back then no one knew what it was. You went to message boards, and there was lots of discussion about the technology behind blockchains and purpose.

Fast forward to 2021, and EVERYONE knows what crypto is. You have celebrities selling NFTs and people paying millions for them, and apps like RH making it super easy to 1 click buy without having to handle setting up a wallet, backups, etc, and institutional involvement as well. You have Coinbase running ads saying ""If you bought bitcoin 10 years ago instead of that coffee you'd be a millionaire now"". Obviously these returns have drawn people in seeking to get rich quick. It's not a pyramid scheme as it's just a decentralized technology, but its valuation effectively functions like one.
