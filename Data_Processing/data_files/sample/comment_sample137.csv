There is a theory that if a hedge fund defaults basically all of the DTCC will be liquidated to bail out GME holders.

At some point it gets too high for a broker to take on that level of collateral and they can't offer a sale on that stock anymore.

I'm sure they did other things that are shitty, but I was too itchy with the trigger finger when it came to accusing them of manipulating the market, when it's actually the clearing house which sets the collateral rules for them.

There are two scenarios:
1. MOASS happens: there is plenty of DD covering the details of it and the infinite squeeze theory. So there is a chance the price would skyrocket (1k, 10k, 100k, 1m, etc). You decide when you sell.
2. MOASS does not happen: in this scenario, based on the latest events and RC's moves (dream team assembled, payment of long term debts, moving into e-commerce, nfts development,etc) the company could grow naturally to maybe $800 / share (I'm just guessing) in a few years.

> Even if they're doing the right thing at top speed (which I admittedly doubt) it may take years and we don't see much in the meantime

This is a valid criticism, and certainly the SEC has many flaws. I'd like to see far more funding going to hiring more regulators that impose harsher penalties more quickly generally in many fields, the securities industry included. But at the end of the day, there is no reasonably possible way to move on something like this immediately. Regulators cannot make snap judgments like people on reddit can without seriously damaging their credibility and hunches are not evidence.

Stock prices change everyday by market forces. By this we mean that share prices change because of supply and demand.

Conversely, if more people wanted to sell a stock than buy it, there would be greater supply than demand, and the price would fall.",[],1

NIO is also close to recording a profit and will probably record a profit this year despite the chip shortage. Their YOY sales have been rising astronomically, their production has been increasing and they're slowly improving their supply chain/production. It's extremely hard to make EV cars and the fact they're producing quality EV and are close to making a profit is a good sign. Just look at some of the gimmick EV companies like Lordstown, Lucid Motors, etc, who aren't even on track to producing cars. 

Even if they struggle in Europe they're on track on becoming a major player in China and possibly other Asian markets. I'm personally bullish on them but I understand why people will be scared away such as the fact that NIO is very reliant on the Chinese government and facilities for production.",[],1

2304,gzkrlea,2021-05-26,t1_gzkpqro,wallstreetbets,"You clearly didn't read the article I linked. Market makers buy far more shares to hedge a call they sold than you could afford by using the same money used to buy a call to buy shares. Let's take GME as an example. Market makers hedge by delta*100. A 5/28 $240 GME call has a delta of 0.5558 according to Webull. That means for the cost of a 5/28 $240 call, $1475, a market maker will buy 55.58 shares, or 56 shares rounded. Conversely, $1475 would only buy about 6 GME shares. So by buying a $240 5/28 GME call, you would effectively purchase 50 more shares of GME than had you bought the shares yourself, prompting the purchase of far more shares with the same amount of money and thus driving the price of the stock up to a much greater degree. The same holds for every other ticker. It's options that are contributing to this price action.",['GME'],0

The upheaval of the past years has been great. All markets have been merged into one mega market called The Stonk Market. Shares are now called “tendies”. Floor traders are now shouting “give me 500 tendies of Apple!”. All brokers are called either “autists” or “tards” based on their success. The title of hedge fund manager is now passé. The title of Grand Tard Wrangler is now used exclusively. 

There is a new breed of wealthy person in the world. Country clubs have renovated their golfing lands into paintball grounds and go-kart tracks. Country clubs are no longer seen as being prestigious by their history or clientele but by how good the tendies they serve are and which one has the most bad ass water slide. 

Birth rates skyrocket as 9’s and 10’s suddenly realize how attracted they are to that person working at Wendy’s with a brokerage app and a wild ass YOLO in their heart. 

All ape poaching has come to a screeching halt as protection rangers are now all equipped with what can only be described as “an Ironman style gorilla suit”. 

Cathie Wood has completely lost her mind and now runs a public access show where she throws chicken bones and channels dead people to make stonk predictions. 

And this was all possible because you didn’t get bitch hands when you finally went green again during the squeeze.

Shares are borrowed, and shares represent legal ownership in a company; previously companies issued stock certificates with your name on it that proved legal ownership.  When you buy shares, you own the shares.  As an owner, you may lend your shares to short-sellers for a fee.  I believe the US laws sees stock as ""Personal Property""  ([https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/legal-definition-of-personal-property.html#:\~:text=The%20legal%20definition%20of%20personal%20property%20is%20%E2%80%9Canything%20besides%20land,personal%20property%3A%20tangible%20and%20intangible](https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/legal-definition-of-personal-property.html#:~:text=The%20legal%20definition%20of%20personal%20property%20is%20%E2%80%9Canything%20besides%20land,personal%20property%3A%20tangible%20and%20intangible). )  Shorts who don't cover face margin calls and even bankruptcy, which is typically why they cover, not because of legal obligations, but I'd imagine if your shares were not returned to you, then you must sue to get them back.  Going thru bankruptcy, however, may lead to the legal obligation to repay their debt - for example, liquidating assets, an asset being anything in the short-seller's possession that can be turned into cash (stock, bonds, office equipment etc.).",[],0

If that's what you want, set your trigger at $240 and your limit at $217.

Then if it dips to 240, your broker will execute a limit order at 217, and you'll get the best price it can find you as long as that price is 21 or higher. Then when it recovers and rips, you won't get any of the tendies, just like you want. 🧻🤲 can get off the rocket.

Let’s say you want to invest in X stock. All of the metrics look good, it’s been trending up all day at an average pace of $1 per hour, and volume is consistent and decent. If it’s at $13 and you see a block of 100,000 shares at $20. It would be reasonable to assume with all the information that it will go up and pause at $20 until several million dollars are brought to buy those shares (if the day’s trend continues and the metrics stay positive for growth). That’s fantastic ROI—anyone who isn’t an idiot would invest.

Now let’s say the block is instead at $13.50. Would you buy in knowing that with the current volume and the bid/ask price pattern that you would only be up $0.50 a share before potentially bouncing off and heading down? If you were in a stock with high institutional to retail investment ratio then maybe—$0.50 over tens of thousands of shares add up. But what if a large portion of the pride movement is driven by retail (or at least guided by retail) like in meme stocks ? Individual retail buyers don’t have the capital to break a block of that magnitude on their own, thus encouraging holders to sell a little before it hits $20 and discouraging new buyers from investing in the first place—$0.50 gain on 50 shares of a stock with unpredictably high volatility isn’t worth it. And it doesn’t mean they aren’t going to invest, it just means they are waiting for the potential ROI to justify the risk.",[],0

7497,gzl41fk,2021-05-27,t1_gzktz1y,wallstreetbets,"Yup & when GME peaked at what ~$483? & got all that media attention, a lot of big swinging dicks on Wall Street saw it as a no lose play because they assumed that retail would flee when they drove the price down.

Their arrogance wouldn’t let them even consider that the Apes might not only hold the line - let alone even consider that they might actually double down because the Apes liked the stock & knew that if they owned the float all they had to do was wait while the HFs & BSDs bleed themselves dry.

I think at this point - Apes probably own quite a bit more than the float which means that a lot of the shorts are going to get rogered & good trying to close out their positions.

Of course, they have to either admit that they lost or go bankrupt for that to happen & as it happens, I grew up in a seriously old money family (*don’t kidnap me, I intentionally got disinherited & now they wouldn’t buy me a cup of coffee, let alone pay a ransom*) so I know exactly how these pigfuckers think & I walked away from all of it because it was toxic as shit.

Amazing. So far, this whole week has been a bulls week. Tuesday was just a small set-back. AMC all the way. So close to $20. Patience has paid off and AMC keeps going up. I’m still holding on to my AMC shares. Since job report comes out tomorrow morning, and the futures look a little red, I bought a $2,432 put on GOOG. GOOG has been going up like crazy. With a crazy jump like that since last week, GOOG might go down with the market ends being ted tomorrow",['AMC'],0

They had at 2/11/2021 1,561,352,718 shares outstanding so at a share price of $0.8815 the market cap is $1.376B USD.

In the case of Virgin Galactic, if one of the ships works, I'm willing to bet they can just copy the same blueprints and make a bunch more. And it seems like there is a great deal of demand for the tickets. And it seems like they can keep costs low with reusable ships. Plus, there is no competition. By the time Blue Origin or SpaceX start offering tourists trips into space, many wealthy boomers will have died.

I'm in Gamestop with 5 shares @ 187, and a little in AMC. I sold all my free shares on WeBull the other day and bought 3 shares of AMC @14 when it was trading @ 12.50.
