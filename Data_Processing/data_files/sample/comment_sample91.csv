21,gyxnp5b,2021-05-21,t1_gyvtig5,investing,"""She runs a bunch of hyper growth funds and you're absolutely right that hyper growth isn't going to outperform every year""

It's not going to perform every year but after 150%+ gains (which ""unless this time is very different"" were not going to repeat) last year she really would have been rewarded for playing at least a little defense and being a little more cautious. If after 150% gains she came out and said, ""hey, I'm going to sit in cash a little because I'm not seeing as many opportunities after that kind of run"" and the funds held up better than they did in the rotation in recent months, she would have seen even more money pour in and would have likely impressed a lot of her critics (including Cramer, which is odd given that CNBC broadly seems like it's never been critical of a guest *ever* that I can recall.) ""OMG, she had performance like that last year and she was able to play some defense/pivot when it was called for?"" 

And I'm not a critic, really - I just have what I think are sorta reasonable concerns.

I guess what I'd love to hear from her is some change in opinion at times. It's ""I love hyper growth"" 24/7/365. It's okay to be a hyper growth manager and come out and say, ""there's not as many opportunities right now."" I don't know that I've ever heard her talk about something growth-related she doesn't like. She's talked about not liking value but I'd love to hear that she doesn't like this sector of growth, or a hyper growth name for some reason. Every ""disruptive"" theme seems like it's exciting/potentially worthwhile to Ark.

""She believes over a 5 year time horizon, her basket of hyper growth is likely to double in value, or I guess now it's 125% of value. I agree that's silly.""

I think it's very promotional. I don't recall a mutual fund/ETF manager making 5 year predictions on their performance at all (or performance predictions like that in general), but she has now done it twice in 6 months and has upped it. She has talked about corrections in the past, but I think all of the hype over future performance offsets that. My concern becomes new/er investors performance chasing/over-allocating because of past performance/hype. Early this year I said on here when I started to see people talking about ""100% Ark"" and ""How Many Ark Funds Do You Own?"" that people shouldn't chase what was very likely not sustainable performance and should not have that sort of allocation.

""she's a fraud because her funds are down 30% from their high after a 150% 1Y return""

She's definitely not a fraud. I think she's an aggressive promoter and never seems to dial down her view/hype of the universe of stocks she's interested in. While she has certainly discussed the long-term (and predicted her long-term performance) the promotion can feel a little short-term focused. 

""mixing faith and investing.""

I don't have any issue with that at all. There are a number of various faith-based funds. 

""I find the cult of personality silly and she has certainly fed it""

I think the sort of aggressive promotion/cult of personality benefits during the good times but it's the opposite when things turn. The ""cult of personality"" certainly benefited Ark last year when people started copycatting anything she was doing and waiting for the trade lists every day to buy what Cathie was buying - more buying of Ark names, Ark goes up further, more performance chasing, more money coming in (""What we've seen over the past year plus is equivalent to like 16 Januses during that firm's heyday."", https://twitter.com/syouth1/status/1360958603746811907), more Ark buying these names, more people copycatting, etc etc etc. 

They're ETFs, so they're not going to close and does it get to a point where asset bloat is a problem? There is the sub-advised mutual fund (which is basically sort of the mutual fund version of ARKK - american beacon ark transformational innovation fund) that they could have closed but did not. 

""For example, can you say you disagree with the 5-year prospects of most of ARKF's top 10 holdings? ""

For most of those no and fintech/payments is one area that I've actually added to over the last several months. But it's a question of how much to allocate even with a long-term view and whether the last few months is simply a rotation out of growth or more of a short-to-medium-term change where growth and the appetite for rich valuations is not going to be there to the same degree for a while.

Last year's performance in growth I think lead to some people feeling that that performance validated/confirmed those themes and signaled more gains ahead - including EVs, where stocks of many of the newly public companies have been obliterated.  That's not to say that EVs won't continue to be a theme, but you had a ""buy at any price"" mania for companies some of which won't have a product for a while and one of which (WKHS, which ARKQ still owns some shares of) delivered 6 trucks last quarter but was at one point valued over $5B. Former Reg A IPO (and what looks like a bigger Kickstarter company) FUV is down nearly 80% from February. 

I think the success of Ark last year lead people to focus heavily on ""what's the next disruptive story!?!?!"" but I think people have to focus on what they view as disruptive themes with the most potential and even within those themes have to focus on the highest quality stories. A lot of the EV stuff last year became ""buy anything EV related at any price, I don't care if it's delivered a car or not.""  People can be in a theme that does very well over the next 5 years but wind up bagholding for a long time because they bought high due to short-term hype/bought a weaker company. 

""A “big market delusion,” according to the paper, occurs when all the firms in an evolving industry rise together, despite that fact that they are competing against each other and only some can ultimately succeed. The trio cited airlines as a past example of an industry built around emerging technology, where “virtually every company in the business either failed or merged into a larger airline, most of which also collapsed.”"" (https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qx4f8709q5nf/Big-Market-Delusion-Rob-Arnott-Attacks-Tesla-Electric-Vehicle-Industry)

And I'm definitely not anti growth by any means. I still own SHOP, SQ, SE, TTD and others. I just think people have to be selective and while something might be a ""big theme"" in the years ahead, you still have to try to buy it well and look for what you think are the best name/s. Something might be a theme but lack many compelling long-term plays.

I'm not anti Ark either. I think I'm really for people constructing a portfolio that they're happy with when markets are good or not. There's a lot of ""OMG WHY IS THE MARKET DOWN?"" posts on this sub and I look and the market is down 1% or something. I'm definitely not ""no Ark"" or no aggressive growth. I think a lot of people think about the upside when they see things perform like Ark has, but they should think about the downside/potential volatility and what sort of allocation if they're going to own long-term is comfortable through positive periods and negative periods - and something like that is certainly capable of tremendous upside when things are great and tremendous downside when things aren't.

25,gyxo1be,2021-05-21,t1_gyxn7k1,investing,"Yeah, that's what I'm thinking as well. I mean, they have good reputation and I certainly believe they can hold their own and prevail.

But thinking about it - the plant-based milk industry is estimated to generate 21b of revenue in 5 years, it generated 16b of revenue in 2018 iirc. So that's a healthy growth rate, but it's still not a huge market. And that market is much more than just oat milk.

Since they are looking into expanding in the plant-based cheese market I looked that one up as well, and apparently that one generates roughly 1b of revenue globally.

So we're looking at a company that's far from having the leading position or even just a substantial market share in that space as I understand, and that company is valued 13b when the entire global market for it's product + many different alternatives for the foreseeable future generates less than double their valuation in revenue.

Now I know that's not exactly a metric to look at since valuation is much more than just revenue, but I just can't wrap my head around how this is trading at 13b. At the same time I'm having a lot of trouble estimating a fair market cap for them.

27,gyxo3vq,2021-05-21,t1_gyxlv13,investing,"The “crypto” in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Etherum is there because new coins are generated by process called “mining”, which I would explain in simple terms as “computer solving complex digital puzzles”. This process is what determines the rarity element and that everyone theoretically can “find” new currency. Besides the fact that for mining, you would need a large amount of computing power through GPUs based mining-rigs.

On the other hand a digital currency backed by a central bank can only be generated by the bank itself. There will be no mining process and only the central bank will have the power to generate new coins. With this process the value of each digital coin would be determined by the central bank and would most likely have equal value that their normal currency. In a US example, 1 FED-issued digital coin = 1$.

The advantage for the bank is that every single digital coin would have a unique NTF that would allow to track and trace a specific coin throughout all his life. In turn, this would be a large overview and control power to the bank to follow digital payments. This would facilitate taxation, reduce illegal use of money (such as for criminal transactions, tax avoidance, money laundering).

For the common Joe, it would mean less paperwork and hustle while dealing with the government for payments, but also much less privacy and secrecy.",[],1

I would recommend looking into index investing.  This is the blog/book that got me into index investing: [https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/](https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/)

Mr. Collins talks about working in an investment firm that traded a specific sector of the market.  His coworkers spend over 40 hours a week researching companies in a specific industry, having monthly conversations with CEOs, and they still couldn't outperform the market.

The two brokerages I see recommended the most are Vanguard and Fidelity.  I use Vanguard, because they were the first with low-cost index funds, and their ownership structure is set up that everyone that owns their funds is an owner of the company.

Congratulations for starting at 21.  As long as you have your budget set to where you can invest monthly or bi-weekly, you're going to kill it as long as you don't take unnecessary risks.

That was my point, it's not particularly inflationary, and on a longer term basis probably has more deflationary tendencies (although that depends where the $ goes). It DOES keep yields low, which can allow inflation to run hot without tightening financial conditions, but it's not on it's own a cause of inflation. At the end of the day, you need banks to lend and people to spend - QE does not cause this, it just allows the above to occur without rates crashing the party.

> is fiscal stimulus debt or money printing?

Moreso debt on the public side, but that in effect isn't much different from printing since it temporarily expands the money in the system. It's also a good bit more complex as a reserve currency than it would be if we were a non-reserve currency. If it weren't for QE, rising yields would theoretically offset the expansion of money, but QE keeps yields in check, which would allow inflation to rise.",[],0

That you want to rephrase that whole conversation that bitcoin is not a store of value, has no practical use, isn't a store of value... is all on you.

It will evolve sure. But cease to exist? I think it'll still be around. Wether it's a good store of value or not is a completely different subject and I've neither argued for or against it.

>These are collectables, you never claimed bitcoin was a collectable, are you saying bitcoin is a collectable? Because I'll agree with that, how you describe it, bitcoin sure does seem pretty useless.

So now I need express a use AND why it's better. Well you're moving the goal posts. You're the one comparing it to banking in the first place. Or software. Or collectables.

Anything but gold is allowed apparently.

&#x200B;

>So to conclude, you have no expressed why a typical person would ever have a reason to use bitcoin or any crypto so that seems like you are talking a niche product. Doesn't seem like a good investment.

I don't need to because I never claimed it was. 

1) better than banking for a typical person - you created that narrative yourself.  I merely pointed out some uses to it other than investing, and 2) Never claimed it wasn't a niche product, what that has to do with anything I'm not sure. Plenty of niche products are good investments.

And what defines a good investment anyway? And does that differ from person to person - probably!

So to conclude. You can't read. You make up your own narrative. And Bitcoin can be compared to TikTok, or literally any software you want, oh, and banking. But not Gold.

The CFT classifies Bitcoin as a commodity. IRS classifies it as an asset. Man on internet claims it as a piece of software like social media.

Because buy-side analysts work for institutional investors.  This tendency to set unrealistic price targets is not unique to Amazon.  It's endemic.

I've ignored financial news networks and buy-side analysts for 20 years, and for twenty years I've consistently beaten the market by focusing on one thing: steeply undervalued securities.

The only thing buy-side analyst targets tell me is what the rest of the market is likely to overpay for the stock I purchased at a discount to fair value... Real world example:

I purchased 1000 shares of Berkshire Class B common shares act $160.  I kept holding all 1000 until the the gap between current market price and the low consensus price target (vs. average or high target) started to narrow.  As the market price crossed the low price target I trimmed my position to 500 shares.",[],0

Some could say that is because it's building market cap. So if it's 'like gold, but better' imagine if anyone would convert their gold allocation to BTC over a short period of time. Massive outperformance. That massive outperformance would drive speculation. Speculation brings volatility. Until consolidation and very high market cap you would have volatility. 

I think is mostly because of uncertainty and speculation. Speculators are known to buy high and sell low, so it explains the price action. Uncertainty may bring some investor to sell it in fear of whatever. 

Consider that BTC exist since a decade. Gold, the classic inflation edge, has been a store of value for millennia and it went from 2200 down to 1700 in what? 6 months? Is that a store of value? Especially in the year with most M2 increase + fiscal stimulus ever in history?

>Why would buying later be a ""better way to deploy capital"" if your expectation in 2009 was that the price would go up?

It's all fine and well that you're picturing this in hindsight, but two things are important here:

1. In 2009, you would not know what the price in 2013 is going to be... so there's no basis by which you can tell me ""In 2009, I would have waited until 2013"".
2. Why are you picturing this as an either/or proposition?  My portfolio is always diversified by sector and asset class.

When I buy a security at well below fair value, it is always possible some other investment is out there, but I generally hold seven to 15 common stock positions, three or four preferred stock positions, sort and long term treasuries, corporate bonds, and at least 20% cash at any given time... So if the scenario arises that ""this other undervalued security popped up on the radar"" I'm likely to be holding both... and I might decide to rebalance them along the way.

None of that has anything to do with the fact that the $2.28 is a better price than $2.50 or $15... which was the sole point of that individual comment.

Could easily have been a not great business already that was further impacted by the pandemic.

Ashford cut 95% of staff during the pandemic - https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ashford-hospitality-trust-hotel-executive-monty-bennett-layoff-furlough-95-percent-staff/

Given that this is a hotel REIT, hotel REITs were absolutely obliterated by the pandemic and are generally horrendously poor performers in any sort of economic downturn - many of them cut their dividend in 2008 entirely and many didn't bring back the div until years later. I'm not familiar with Ashford but I do see that they suggested in December that bankruptcy was a possibility. It's bounced recently with other hotel REITs as things have gotten somewhat better with travel. Personally, hotel REITs are not something that I really focus on - they do well coming out of a downturn, are generally so-so performers when things are great and then the moment there's the slightest hint of another downturn, they crater.",[],1

The industrial revolution created the only time period in all of history characterized by **nominal** wage growth accompanied by a rapid expansion in supply which resulted in deflation.  The first part being the obvious reason why that period of deflation was entirely different than every single other one in recorded history.  Normally with deflation wages fall - the only reason they did not here was because of a one time unprecedented increase in production efficiency driving up production while simultaneously reducing costs and resulting in a need for higher skill(paid) employees.

But you have not established a relation that makes us think bitcoin will last as long as gold. This is unfounded

> That you want to rephrase that whole conversation that bitcoin is not a store of value, has no practical use, isn't a store of value... is all on you.


No, i pointed out that it's not in early discovery and as we can see as a piece of tech running on the internet it's likely already 25-50% through it's lifecycle. We can also see that it's stupid to compare an element, something that has existed long before humans and something that will exist long after humans to man made software that won't even function in it's current state in a few decades from now.

>> Compared to gold where there's evidence of a gold/silver value ratio as far back as 3100 BC... I'd say twelve years is pretty early still.
>> No, my point is that it's still in ""early discovery""... especially when comparing it to Gold.

> No I didn't. Show me where I claimed bitcoin was an element. You did. You made that strawman.

You claimed bitcoin was like gold, golds value has always been because of its properties as an element. see quotes.


> It will evolve sure. But cease to exist? I think it'll still be around. Wether it's a good store of value or not is a completely different subject and I've neither argued for or against it.

You argued that bitcoin was a good store of value and that it would exceed a savings account when it comes to interest rates. You are now claiming the opposite.


> Didn't claim it again. You asked me to justify it's price and I said it's driven by supply and demand like any tradeable asset. Again - trying to say things I didn't say. You seem to have more and more an issue with reading.

Yes, because for assets with utility you can justify a price, we can justify a price for gold and for stocks. If you can't do that for bitcoin well that's interesting isn't it? This is literally the point of the subreddit.

> So now I need express a use AND why it's better. Well you're moving the goal posts. You're the one comparing it to banking in the first place. Or software. Or collectables.

I'm actually just asking you to answer my original question ""I'm a normal Canadian, why would I ever use bitcoin over my current bank?"" you are the one who decided to ignore that.

If you think it's not an alternative for banking you are welcome to identify different competitors and aswer the same question.


> Anything but gold is allowed apparently.

Well you can't use bitcoin like you use gold so that makes sense, you obviously don't think we are making bitcoin plated electronics right? This is because as an element gold has properties that make is valuable. 

> I don't need to because I never claimed it was.
> 1) better than banking for a typical person - you created that narrative yourself. I merely pointed out some uses to it other than investing, and 2) Never claimed it wasn't a niche product, what that has to do with anything I'm not sure. Plenty of niche products are good investments.

1) you actually didn't point out any uses other than investing that are better than the competition

2) ""Already stated, that those benefits don't appeal to you is your personal choice and I'm not here to change your mind. "" <-- that's you saying that if your few edge cases aren't appealing it's not worth using, ergo, niche product.



> And what defines a good investment anyway? And does that differ from person to person - probably!

A good investment is something that has value and/or generates value, things have value because of a combination of utility and scarcity. You have not demonstrated that bitcoin has value and you have not expressed why anyone should ever use bitcoin past to invest. If the only use of bitcoin is to invest then congrats, it's worthless as soon as you can't find a bigger idiot to buy it. Just ask yourself, if there were 0 other investors how would you make money?


> So to conclude. You can't read. You make up your own narrative. And Bitcoin can be compared to TikTok, or literally any software you want, oh, and banking. But not Gold.
 
Gold has value because it's shiny, anti bacterial, easy to mold, doesn't corrode and is conductive among other things. Even if no one invested in gold it would have value.

So for example can you express why bitcoin should be compared to gold instead of granite or a jpeg?


> The CFT classifies Bitcoin as a commodity. IRS classifies it as an asset. Man on internet claims it as a piece of software like social media.

You know all those social media companies are assets right? do you think companies aren't assets? weird..

I told her that whatever money it makes, Ill use it to buy her something and/or take her out on a nice date.
  
That said, AHT's price is low enough to not stress about losing the money even if it tanks, but on the other side of the coin, if there is a possibility for some kind of actual profit, I was considering buying several more contracts.

This is not true. Look at Florida. Theme parks don't require masks, big chain stores don't require masks. Businesses care about money and making masks mandatory will lower their customer base. Employees might wear masks longer, but it will eventually blow over and I can't imagine companies choosing to spend money on PPE that is not necessary for the job.

358,gyyv4v8,2021-05-21,t3_nhnz2o,investing,"Hey guys, 24 y/o needing some help with future tax optimization. I was saving for a house, but due to recent life events realized I won't be buying anytime soon, and want to invest a good chunk of the down payment fund instead (around $10k-$15k). Outside of the down payment fund, I have a 6mo emergency fund, no debts, am already maxing my IRA, 401k, and I do not have an HSA (although will be getting one for 2022 and plan to max it out as well). My employer's 401k plan is not eligible for mega-backdoor-roth contributions, and I am unsure about future education expenses, so I'm not sure a 529 plan makes sense. I believe a taxable account is the only option that makes sense. I've already set one up with Vanguard, but have not bought anything yet.

I expect my expenses to rise in the next couple years, but still want to prioritize retirement accounts. If my expenses start to cut into my retirement savings, it would make sense to continue maxing out the retirement accounts for as long as possible, and sell in the taxable account to continue doing so (which effectively transfers money from the taxable account to a tax-protected account), correct?

If so, I stick to a 3 fund portfolio in my IRA and 401k, and was planning on doing that in the taxable account with mirrored allocations (maybe slightly more bonds in the taxable account, since I plan on using part of the taxable account to save for my next car purchase in ~10 yrs). However, after thinking more thoroughly about the wash-sale tax implications of that, would it make more sense to purchase one of Vanguard's target date funds instead? My thinking is:

Approach 1: Purchase VTSAX, VTIAX, and VBTLX in the taxable account. After a couple years, say VTSAX and VTIAX are both up $2k, but VBTLX is down $1k. If I sold then (to move that money to retirement accounts), I would have $4k in taxable gains, but the $1k that I could've claimed as losses counts as a wash sale, because I also buy VBTLX in my retirement accounts. So I am taxed on $4k of gains, since wash sales only apply to losses, not gains.

Approach 2: Purchase a Vanguard Target Date Fund that roughly mimics the allocation in Approach 1. Assuming the same gains/losses as above, I would have 1 fund with ~$3k in gains (as opposed to $4k gains and $1k losses). I still have the same amount of unrealized gains, but this approach reduces my taxable gains by $1k compared to the above approach, right?

Is approach 2 clearly the better strategy for taxes? Or is there something I'm getting wrong/not seeing that would make a better strategy? After I sell in the taxable account, could I just pause VBTLX purchases in my retirement accounts for ~30 days to avoid this? Or would simply holding VBTLX in the account have any effect on wash sale rules? Thanks.",[],0

I just finished listening to David Rosenberg on MacroVoices and he also still believes this inflation won't be anything more than transitory. He's been a deflationist as long as I've been listening to him, but he explains that we didn't have inflation with a 3.5% unemployment rate which was the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. We didn't have inflation with trade wars, tariffs and protectionism or with tax cuts under Trump. We didn't get inflation under Ben Bernanke with any of the QE's...

If they couldn't hit their inflation average with the lowest unemployment numbers in 50 years, what makes you think that all of a sudden with an extra 7 million people unemployed there will be enough upwards wage pressure to sustain inflation? When this last round of stimulus checks is done and the extended unemployment benefits run out, all these people aren't going to be looking for work? Or do people think the government is going to be giving stimulus check after stimulus check?

The last point I'd make is one I mentioned back in December where Cathie advocated taking money off the table and/or keeping dry powder to buy dips in the future. Ark remains fully invested at all times, which probably makes sense if you're running a hyper growth fund. Yes, we know hyper growth has volatility and can bleed 30-40% in a few months; but conversely also tend to be the stocks that shoot up 30-40% in a few days based on some catalyst or other. Wouldn't it be foolish for someone running a hyper growth fund to miss a run in hyper growth because they decided to play defensive? As you mentioned from her past performance, she doesn't play defense on her gains and in the past that's led to trouble. It's definitely something to watch for.

Your last paragraph is the perfect caviat: Ark offers fully-invested, highly-volatile funds focused on long-term hypergrowth. It's up to the individual investor to use them effectively; whether it's buying puts for downside protection, selling CC's on the way up, or simply taking some profits every now and then. Putting 50% or more of one's portfolio into ARK requires either some extreme risk tolerance or some advanced risk mitigation tactics; but especially after a year of unprecedented outperformance, it's probably just a bad idea (performance chasing). In either case, I think the ARK story will become clearer over the next 2-5 years whether it's Janus 2.0 or an effective way of investing in the world of the future; probably turns out to be somewhere between the two.

You bought Apple at $126 and change and it's now $126.05. That's barely anything; you have to get more used to volatility. Additionally, why do you feel you need to day trade?

1.  They could try to grow the business,  build a new factory or a new mine, or whatever. 
2. They could grow by buying another company 
Both of those could be good or bad, is there enough demand for the new factory to make it worth opening,  etc.
3.  They can give the money back to the shareholders by paying a dividend
4. They can give the money back by buying it's own stock. 

Buying stock benefits you because it can make the price go up (they buy from someone selling at the current price,  then the person selling a penny higher,  then the person selling a penny above that).  Though they try to spread it out by not buying all at once,  what they really want to do is reduce the number of shares.  The companies earnings are measured in amount of money per share or EPS.  For the same earnings with fewer shares the EPS is higher. 

Really your shares represents a claim or part ownership of the company.   To use an extreme example,  if you own one single share of a company with only 100 shares,  you owe 1/100 or 1% of the company.   If the company buys back 50 shares,  you would now own 1/50th or 2% of the company.  

Usually companies don't just do one of these,  they will use some money to buy back stock, and some to grow the business and sometimes pay some out as a dividend.  All depends on where they think the best use of the money is. If they choose poorly the shareholders sell, or elect a board that will fire the CEO.",[],0

A geometric analysis can be much more thorough and complimentary to your portfolio research because there is a heavier focus on compounded returns over time (ie. Nth root of the sum product of returns).

Start with a Markowitz optimization and move to different optimization methods (eg. CVaR, RP, etc.).

If you make that combo your core holding, then it is easy to throw overweights on top of it with other ETFs...  Bull Markets in the final third tend to reward Mega Cap, consumer discretionary, and whatever sectors have won throughout the bull (tech, health care in this one). 

If you want to put real estate in there as an overweight, have at it.  gold is a commodity, i think general commodities are better diversification plan than just gold, but commodities are a crap shoot and don't give automatic inflation protection.

522,gyzbwkw,2021-05-21,t1_gyz9nuu,investing,"The summary from where I’ve seen the argument is that technically non-dividend paying stocks are very similar to dividend paying stocks, it’s just a different measurement of how you make your money. For example, for non-dividend stocks, you make your money through selling. If your company makes 1 dollar, and costs 100 dollars, it takes that 1 dollar and reinvests it, making their stock 101 dollars. For a dividend stock, you make your money when the company pays out a dividend - if they make 1 dollar and the share costs 100 dollars, they take that 1 dollar and give it to share holders but their stock stays at 100. So growth tends to be slower for dividend stock holders, but they receive the direct dividend. For non dividend, they make their money when they sell.

Going into more intricacies, technically in a tax-advantaged account, there is no real difference between dividend vs non dividend - you’re likely to see the same growth. The real issue comes down to taxable accounts where you get charged capital gains on dividends issued - even if it’s re-invested into the same security. So your growth would be slower, since you now have tax drag on dividend reinvestment, vs if the company just had reinvested the money.

The best argument I’ve heard so far is that you buy these non-dividend-paying stocks in the hopes that they’ll be profitable enough in the future to one day start paying dividends (AAPL being a great example).",['AAPL'],0

When a company begins to pay a dividend, they are essentially saying ""We don't have a project to put this money in right now, so here you go.""  

Look at Coca-Cola (KO).  Fat dividend, and they rake in HUGE amounts of cash every year.  Stock price has doubled since 2008.  That's great, but that's nothing compared to growth stocks.  The Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) has seen a 340% return over the same period.

Do not invest money you need in the short term

You can only contribute the amount of your earned income to an IRA, up to a max of 6k - so if you have less than 6k of earned income this year you can't max it out completely

Look how many companies went into manufacturing or distributing PPE.

2. The number of companies that entered shows you that there may be a ton of excess supply and production capacity. But let's say there's a new respiratory virus pandemic tomorrow. There may no longer be an excess, but the difference between supply and demand won't be like the first few months of COVID.

However, let's say you see a PPE company that, in late 2019, was trading for $20 a share. You assessed $20 was about the company's intrinsic value. During the height of COVID, the company went for $100 a share. Today, it's $12 a share because other investors freaked out about the end of COVID... and you assess nothing has changed in the company since the pre-COVID days.

I’m admittedly left learning but I’m a capitalist to my core (provided it’s regulated, open, and fair) as I believe it’s the only political ideology suited for a democratic and free society.

But when entire towns and generations of workers are at the whims of traders and speculators because of the sole subsistence of a single source of income... that’s not capitalism, that’s nearly feudalism where the rich lord (and core source of income) has been replaced with a finite resource. 

I don’t know if I have an answer other than government subsidies for temporary worker camps (preventing people from tying their future to a town with a limited lifespan) but stories about towns or workers being crushed on the whims of the market (like North Dakota oil workers) really depresses me.",[],0

699,gyzud0r,2021-05-21,t1_gyzqv9e,investing,"Dividends do not create value because they come out of the company.

Super simple example, I form SIRGLASS inc.  Its simply a bank account with $100 in it and it has 100 shares. I own all 100 shares. 

Lets say I sell you 1 share for $1 and pocket the dollar. So now you own 1% of $100. 

Lets say one year later we earn $1 in interest so the bank account has $101 inside it. This means now each share is worth 1% of 101 or $1.01. So lets say I declare a $0.01 dividend  and I pay you $0.01. Great you earn $0.01 ! But now the bank account only has $100 in it. Your 1% ownership now is no longer worth 1.01 but down to 1.00.

The dividend didn't create value. With out the dividend your share is worth $1.01. With the dividend your share is worth $100 and you get $.01 cash. Its the same thing.

More complex yes you really do own part of the company. It also means if the company is sold you have to get paid just as much as the other share holders. It also means the management, board of directors have a fiduciary duty to all share holders even minority ones.  Meaning take my company SIRGLASS inc , I own 99% of it, you own 1%. I can do \*almost\* anything because I have an controlling interest . However I could not for example screw you over. I couldn't for example say ""I am selling the company (worth $100) for $1 to my wife"" giving you $.01 and basically screwing you out of 0.99 this would break fiduciary duty and you could sue me and win.",[],0

1) *You* have to declare a 1c dividend for me to get it back. I feel like the 1c should be mine whether or not you want to give it bc am I not entitled to 1% of the profit? The choice should be mine whether I want to leave it with the company or take some/all of it

2) If I find someone who will buy my share for $4, then my share is worth $4 regardless of dividend or not. The worth is totally at the whims of the buyers. Whether or not anyone would buy it for $4 is a different matter - in our example here, we’re only dealing with cash whose value is more or less absolute. In actual cases, with more intangibles, some people may value a share at $4. Regardless, if someone is buying it for $4, the EPS didn’t actually affect much.

Ali Baba, JD, Pinduoduo, Baidu - most high-quality Chinese companies are undervalued. I'd also add Niu to the list, might be a bit small for some, early in the growth stages.

Top-tier banks are still reasonably priced - JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley. Capital One and Discover Financial, still reasonably priced.

I'm torn on oil supermajors. Realistically they have 20-30 good years left before oil revenues decline substantially, and plenty of other companies are more like 5-10 years from bankruptcy with higher P/E multiples (mall REITs, department stores).

Fintech - Paypal and Square. Some others I'm on the fence about in terms of valuation.

788,gz012yi,2021-05-21,t1_gyzx0lb,investing,"A few points

1. So my example was overly simplistic however, if a company has ""profits"" it can do a few things with it. If it paid out 100% of its cash flow to owners it could never expand. Also almost all companies have debt, especially newer companies lots of times they are highly leveraged (meaning they have a buch of debt); So with the profits they can do a few thing, like pay down debt, or they can use it to expand (buy a new factory, do more R&D) or they can pay it out back to share holders. ; remember when amazon was just an online book store? Imagine if amazon in 2000 was like ""Well this is it, we became an online book store and we did it. From now on we won't expand into new ventures we will just give all profits back to the share holders"", would that make amazon a better or worse company?
2. Well now this is a much more complex subject as you are 100% right and made a very insightful comment. Companies are not valued at what they are ""worth"" today, they are valued at what investors think they will be worth 5-10-20 years into the future. So the sky is the limit on valuations however there is always pretty much a floor. In very extreme cases the floor is basically the liquidation value of a company.  At some point if the stock becomes so low, someone will buy , even if its just to liquidate the company if they think they can make a profit.  In my dumb example of my company that was only a bank account. If the share price dropped to $98, someone could potentially just buy the company for $98 , then liquidate and make a quick $2 profit. 

Also I have used this example before. Imagine you had a friend who wanted to open a new bar/restaurant and it he needed 1 million to do so. You gave him 100k and got 10% owner ship. The restaurant opens and is a big hit and is profitable . You now own 10% of 1 restaurant. Now you could do a few things you could sit back and take profits or you could start opening new restaurants. Lets say you do that and over the next 10 years you open 10 new restaurants 

Now you no longer own 10% of 1 restaurant , in another view you own 1 full restaurant.

That has real value.",[],0
