Why would they sell shares at $0.60 when their stock is at $1.98?

>Have fun staying poor

Once upon a time I was in the midst of the Internet bubble, taunting people for lacking belief in Internet stocks just as you are taunting people who don't believe in crypto BS, and I then lost the $2 million I had made the previous 14 months as things came crashing down to reality.  While I had finally realized it was indeed a bubble, I was still 3 weeks away from going 100% short/Puts (planned to do so on tax day) and I was left holding the bags.  I learned a lot since then, and have **more** than made that back.  Real estate, stock market, business, going into commercial RE development soon... I'm the opposite of poor, and far more talented with investments than you will ever be.  But keep on fantasizing and spouting nonsense without truly thinking about the underlying lack of logic behind your crypto beliefs.  Trying to link crypto to some new world tech masterpiece, and idealistic anti-government nuttiness that totally lacks real world fiscal knowledge other than in Third World countries lacking Capitalism... shit's hilarious man!

So a small tech company is allowed to pay their CEO $2M but the much larger company can only pay $500k. Those are dummy numbers but the point is that it’s just not an efficient way to reduce excess comp. not going to go into the technical equity valuation side of things, but there’s more than one reason why the ceo pay ratio isn’t a great metric.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years.

Just measuring stock performance is not enough. If the stock goes up, that could also mean there is asset inflation. 

Tesla stock went up, but that was mostly because short sellers got burned, which in turn is mostly because on some trading platforms you can't even go short anymore and since the average skill level of investors went down, the number of people that know they can go short also went down. Tesla should have cratered after the fraudulent transaction with SolarCity, but because investors were so stupid nothing happened. 

I think performance of a CEO for a CPU company could be measured using a wide range of metrics, one of which is the amount of industry standard benchmarks on which the CPU beats all of the competition. You would probably need dozens of metrics to get to some realistic number and you would have to exclude outcomes that were the result of previous CEOs' decisions (or rather attribute those to previous CEOs). 

If you are an outsider to the company, it's impossible to tell. Most economists claim that the CEO's performance is almost completely irrelevant and that only economic factors (outside of the control of the CEO) matter.",[],0

How do you figure that? ""True"" capitalism is a zero-sum game.

It has dramatically outperformed Brandes and ZDI over the long term. Since common inception (December 2014) ZEQ has returned over 88%. Compare that with Brandes and ZDI which returned 36% and 34% respectively. So over that time frame, ZEQ has more than doubled the return of those 2.

How? Because the methodology they used is based of the quality factor of investing which seems to be a superior factor for long-term outperformance in the equity markets. Essentially high quality companies are market leading companies with sustainable competitive advantages (think Amazon) and focus on 3 key variables: high ROE, stable earnings growth, and low financial leverage.

Huge debt isn't always a bad thing, especially in a near zero interest rate economy, and no debt isn't always a good thing. EPS and revenue may be skewed by the one off sale of a property, or some substantial tax write off. There's no single ratio or metric I can look at to say, if this, then buy; it's going to vary wildly from sector to sector and even company to company.

In all, I'm generally not concerned by liabilities, especially if they've shown an ability to pay them down, or have the cash on hand to start doing so.
