Yeah, and that's why I didn't do that. I specifically quoted you to avoid that. You said ""you can't use Bitcoin to buy much of anything anywhere, therefore it is not a currency"". That is incorrect. If that WERE the way the world decided what is/isn't a currency--it's not, by the way--then by your very own standard the kwanza, the cook islands dollar, and many, MANY more ""aren't real currency"" because I can buy more with Bitcoin in NYC then I can with kwanza anywhere in the world. Again, that's NOT how we define a currency, so you're literally just throwing shit at a wall to see what sticks.



>Crypto in its current state is a speculative investment vehicle. That is to say, people aren't buying Dogecoin or any of the other flavor of the week cryptocurrencies so they can then use it to buy groceries or pay their power bills. They're buying in hopes that its value will increase relative to their own standard currency so they can sell it later for profit... and then use THAT money to buy groceries and pay their power bills.



And people's speculation have nothing to do with what is is. They can eat the Bitcoin, shit on it, throw it off a highway, it doesn't matter and what other people are doing with their dollarydoos, euros, or Bitcoin isn't really relevant. Like at all.

>Why would anyone give two shits about that?

I think he means to say that it's more of a ""fixed""quantity of Bitcoin. I think it's very unlikely to happen but there's always the possibility of the next politicians to be even more printing money friendly. The dollar is very stable, but one thing you can't deny is that it can be printed out of thin air by the treasury/legislation based on whoever is in power in the US. Crypto is a ""global"" currency/asset. 


>I mean, you will also know the rate at which the US dollar will inflate

Goes back to the point above. 


>PayPal? God forbid I defend PayPal, but they're faster and cheaper than sending BTC. And that's saying something

Tell that to the people who've been locked out of their money for no reason and have had to fight tooth and nail because PayPal isn't regulated as banks are. At their sole discretion, they can choose to fuck you over. You can legally fight back but not without paying lots of money. In the US, sending money between people in banks takes a few days unless you pay to ""wire"" money. Zelle is starting to take over but they have limits between 500. 2000 per day AND it's tracked by your bank. Some would argue that the bank or government doesn't need to know how much/how often or to whom you exchange money with. We've kind of accepted that already but just stating something not obvious. 


>My US dollars are pretty secure in a standard bank account...

Sure. I don't think this is such a great point against the dollar. BUT you should realize that everyday people don't have the luxury of having multiple thousands of dollars in their bank and are charged fees by large banks to maintain their accounts. $12 a month for someone who has less than $500 in their bank account seems kind of a lot. Again, people have accepted this as normal and there's ways to not pay a fee but you can't argue that the freedom of crypto might be something that people want.

There's a transparency in Ark funds that breaks norms in a way that is \*mostly\* beneficial to investors.

She believes over a 5 year time horizon, her basket of hyper growth is likely to double in value, or I guess now it's 125% of value. I agree that's silly. But as an investor, you can see what the funds you own are actually doing on a daily basis and decide if it remains something you want to own.

Taking Cathie out of the equation, her ETF's are baskets of stocks that you can make a decision if you want to own or not. I find the cult of personality silly. It was silly when people were calling her money tree at the peak and it's equally silly saying she's a fraud because her funds are down 30% from their high after a 150% 1Y return. It's never been a large allocation for me, but I continue to watch the daily trades, know what are in the funds, and own it for that reason. For example, can you say you disagree with the 5-year prospects of most of [ARKF's top 10 holdings](https://ark-funds.com/fintech-etf)?

The value of USD over a time horizon of 100 years has declined 99%, so it'd be fair to assume it will decline another 99% in the coming 100 years if it survives that long. Clearly fiat is not good to hold long-term. Many people buy stocks. Individual stocks as well as index funds are in massive bubbles by every measure, because people mindlessly throw money in without any regard to the underlying value of the companies.

There is a use case for a thing called a ""savings account"" which used to be a thing that yielded interest that would offset the deterioration of fiat value over time. Central banks around the globe have killed the notion of savings accounts due to ""easy money"" & ""infinite debt"" policies, quantitative easing. Over the past century, gold has been seen as an inflation hedge or an alternative form of a long-term savings account. 

Bitcoin by its programmatic definition is better than fiat cash, gold, and savings accounts at preserving value, even if the user-base stagnates, but bitcoin also has the upside potential of new adoption as people grow to trust it and see it as a new and improved form of a long-term savings account.",[],1

That only really works out if the issuance of new ETH is less than the fee burn, but issuance is going to drop dramatically as well due to the transition to proof-of-stake.

Fees represent real-world value paid by users in accordance with the value they place on getting their transaction through, so imho all this actually does establish intrinsic value for ETH.

Hi, I'm 22 and from the UK, I like the idea of new markets and choosing my plan, I contribute 21% of my salary to pension (employer pays 15%)
  
My default pension plan would be 100% Global Equity Fund, but I would like some more diversification. For example, that fund only has a 0.2% exposure to emerging markets.
  
I was considering:
  
80% Global Equity Fund (TER 0.17%)
  
5% NA Equity Fund (TER 0.05%)
  
5% Global Emerging Markets (TER 0.70%)
  
4% Asia Pacific (Excluding Japan) (TER 0.05%)
  
2.5% Europe Excluding UK (TER 0.05%)
  
2.5% UK (TER 0.04%)
  
1% Japan (TER 0.04%).
  
The Asia Pacific fund only has a 0.1% exposure to China, so the GE does a good job at including that and also the regions like South America and Central, which are not given as Equity Funds to choose from.
  
I'm completely okay and aware that the GEM may well fail for awhile and not take off, but do we think 5% is a reasonable amount to risk?
  
I do plan to monitor geopolitical activity, and I will also be moving some of the % into ESGs (Environmental Social and Goverance) Funds, probably changing 80% GE to 70% GE and then 10% ESG when it becomes available for me.
  
Overall, I'd just like some opinions - I'm trying not to go risk crazy, hence the 80% which is a GE, is this a reasonable level for someone new to investing?

The issue is that monetary control has huge implications globally. Maybe it doesn't affect you much in your first-world life (unless you happen to be carrying nontrivial cash and [a cop pulls you over in the US and decides to take it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States)) but if you take Venezuela going from relatively wealthy nation to destitute poverty due to monetary controls from its government, China's capital controls not only affecting its people but distorting markets worldwide like London and Vancouver as Chinese citizens try to get money out, Argentina (historically and seemingly again now) and countless others, I do think tools to decrease monetary power of such governments will become more useful. TBC, I don't think Bitcoin or Ethereum are those tools today. They are in use in Venezuela and such, but at least to the degree we can measure them, not to a degree that really has any meaningful impact.

Then there's the whole world of remittances: Western Union, Moneygram, and others like them charge obscene rates to send money worldwide, often to poor immigrants sending meager earnings back to their families. Again, not saying Bitcoin or Ethereum or anything else here is solving them, but I don't think the status quo is good, and I don't think a ""regulated cryptocurrency"" will solve it either, and I do think something _like_ Bitcoin _could_ help with problems like that.

Yes, the volatility is insane, the energy problems are real, and to an outsider it looks like a giant pyramid scheme. But at the same time, we've never actually bootstrapped a currency from nothing, with no government/force backing it, and I'm not really sure whether it's even possible. But if I play out hypothetical scenarios of what it might look like, it seems like it would look an awful lot like what we're seeing, with crazy volatility, accusations of pyramid scheme peddlers, and all the usual, and maybe someday stability if enough people believe in it.

tl;dr: I'm not necessarily sold on the current offerings, but I don't think ""regulated crpytocurrencies"" will be the future either, and I think there's a lot of shitty outcomes out there due to today's money that can actually be improved upon",[],1

Not true - You can only buy/sell stocks during ""market hours"", which is 8 hours a day and doesn't include weekends or holidays. You could only buy/sell physical gold when your local gold dealer is open.

Money supply is VERY important. Do you care about the slave trade? In west Africa, the currency was glass beads. Europeans realized they could manufacture glass beads cheaply and bring them over by the boatload to go shopping. This left Africa with a lot of glass beads and Europe with all of their goods and possessions. When they were so impoverished, the logical next step was to buy the people themselves.

You don't, though. Before last year, nobody expected the Federal Reserve to double the money supply.

>PayPal? God forbid I defend PayPal, but they're faster and cheaper than sending BTC. And that's saying something

Paypal is not useful in many countries, especially places with high unbanked populations. It is also censored many places where it is needed most - Venezuela and Palestine for example. I send Bitcoin to unbanked family overseas far cheaper than any bank or remittance service can (due to exchanges batching transactions, my network fee is usually \~$1), and they can exchange it for local currency faster and cheaper than any other method.  


>\- You can secure it in sophisticated ways at a low cost compared to other things.

>My US dollars are pretty secure in a standard bank account...

US Dollars have lost 99% of purchasing power over the past 100 years, and over that period of time, there have been numerous ""bank runs"" where customers try to withdraw their funds and the banks can't fulfill it. It's unlikely, but the time this would happen is when you need it most.  


>None of what you said is attractive about changing your whole lifestyle just to go edgy and incorporate the use of Bitcoin as a CURRENCY in your life.  
>  
>Guess why? Because it's not, and never will be, used as a currency by anyone. Too many hurdles

I don't use it as a currency, and wouldn't advise anyone to - other than for large international transactions. It's interesting to see the government refer to them as ""cryptoassets"" here. I think it's more likely that some central banks will need to prop up their fiat currencies by backing them with Bitcoin. Furthermore, Bitcoin is likely to replace the USD as the global reserve currency, because it doesn't give the economic advantage of ""reserve"" status to a single nation, and it also makes more sense globally than the petrodollar.",[],1

You can open a bank account, use mobile apps, and grow your wealth in investing in real estate and stocks.

Most of the world do not have these privileges. 42% of the world, 4.2 billion people, live under authoritarian regimes. Their currency are often debased and cutoff from the financial system that you enjoy.

The fact that you can protect and grow your wealth by investing in stocks, bonds, and real estate is a privilege most of the world do not enjoy. The fact that you can save for retirement without worrying about it devaluing 90% overnight is a privilege.

Bitcoin provides an escape hatch.

For activists living under state repression, bitcoin provides a way to preserve their money in cyberspace, locked away by encryption.

In Iran and Palestine and Cuba, individuals face sanctions or embargoes because of the misdeeds of their corrupt rulers. Bitcoin gives them a lifeline for earning income or receiving remittances from abroad.

You don't need to have a particular passport or bank card or voting status to use it. No government can turn off your bitcoin if it's threatened by your ideas.

Bitcoin provides an alternative to our increasingly centralized financial system. It gives any activist or journalist a way to raise funds without censorship, a way to save despite the corrosive impact of excessive money printing.

That is Bitcoin's inherent value.",[],1

Message begins:

This makes lots of sense, however, let’s say I trade one crypto for another? That should be a taxable event as well, it’s just that, for now, the onus is on the owner of that crypto to share that info with the govt.  and pay the tax. Some exchanges operate with KYC and some do not. If a person was to choose to trade currencies on an unlisted exchange and then sell those on a KYC exchange, how do they determine basis? Is the basis the initial price that they paid for the original coin? The exchange rate of the coins? There is a lot of space where gains could be concealed and transfers not reported. Admittedly this is part of the reason BTC was created: to allow anyone to transfer wealth to anyone else without the intermediary of a banking system needing to get involved. That also means that there are loads of ways to move funds that would require a lot of investigation to uncover where and how much was transferred. All of this is not to mention certain coins that are designed, from the outset, to be completely anonymous, and therefore opaque to anyone tracing transactions. 

Herein lies the difficulty that governments are going to encounter when attempting to enforce these tax laws. I think the best case scenario would be for crypto currencies to work with governments to make taxation easier and more transparent. That may be a serious long shot for some of them. Less so for others. I think that Some are attempting to work with several governments to gain legitimacy for their crypto system. They seems to think that proper regulation and government compliance will be key to more universal adoption. This will remain to be seen.",[],0

That delay is because the banks want to make sure one account holder has the funds for the other account. Some people might have enough reputation to have the banks trust them and move money faster but essential the delay is to confirm ownership.

With the block chain that ownership was public and verified by millions of other people. So if people want to move large sums of money around the delay to verify ownership doesn't take that long.

Now expand that to ALL things and not just money, you can verify ownership of anything. If you have the key that says you own something then you are the owner.

Right now, in a general upswing, anyone receiving BTC would be thrilled to get it. If the market is tanking, that wouldn’t be the case. There’s still going to be bumps before anything stabilizes. You could also trade for a stable coin. That’s still crypto and is pegged to a real world asset. You still don’t go back to fiat and you can still send it anywhere on earth in seconds to be used to buy other cryptos. 

International finance is about to change. Has changed. It’s becoming more democratic the regulatory systems need to be upgraded to account for this. Doing so will tame much of the “Wild West” aspects of the current market economy of crypto, but it’s going to take time and acceptance to do so. 

Sure, governments are pissed. Why wouldn’t they be? Someone has horned in on their turf. The problem is, that if enough people are available to validate the crypto system, it will still work.

This stuff and all the correlations and trades one can put on are covered in many economics 101 courses or monetary policy courses.  The Fed keeps on assuring that any inflation will be limited.  They could definitely be wrong.   A great way to protect oneself is via the inverse bond ETF TBT.  
TBT usually goes up when interest rates go up. (hence why it is an inverse ETF, as bonds tend to move opposite interest rates). Interest rates should (usually) go up if inflation heats up.  Looking at TBT, you can see how it has fallen due to the Fed's influence.  But you have to know a lot more than looking at a chart and saying ""yea I get it.""  Because you likely don't.  For example, these ETFs have serious tracking errors which makes options bets on them even riskier than normal.  Second, a good chunk of the drop on TBT is also due to the effect of interest payments...so people not in the know of how that works are betting without knowing the 'rules'.  
There are some real risks in the trade...if the fed proves to be kinda right...or if they use more of their toolz to push rates from rising anytime soon, or if we have a major world event, geopolitical boom-boom.  
Anyway, bonds tend to move inverse to interest rates.  Fed can control those rates.  Hence why the Fed is pretending to be in total denial of the inflation that is happening in front of our face. High rates tend to hose tech companies....borrowing, etc.  If inflation rises, interest rates are likely to rise.  Killing the housing market which is also hot.

It offers less privacy than banking... Every transaction you make is public and immutable. if you send someone Bitcoin they can see other transactions you have made. If I buy a burger with my credit card the vendor can't see every other thing I've ever bought.

Saying it offers more privacy and it's also 100% public are two contradictory statements...

Past that, the average person does not give a shit about privacy. People post their entire lives on the internet, no one cares if a bank can see where they spend money. 


>Great. You asked me why you would use it. I gave you an answer. If you feel your bank is as secure, then great. Doesn't stop transactions on blockchain being secure.

I asked you why I should use it over a bank, if your answer is ""well it does some things that are similar"" then there's no reason to switch. 



>Never once said ""numbers go up"". Why are you quoting me as saying this to try and win an argument? Strawman AGAIN - it's quite an ugly disingenuous way to debate.

You literally did, you said that I should use Bitcoin instead of my bank because it offers better returns than a savings account...


>If you've been mining since 2011 you must know, or at least be interested in the use of blockchain? .... which is curious as you've also likened it to shit and TikTok.

I understand the uses of an immutable linked list that can only be appended to via a consensus algorithm

Which is why I understand that comparing software to software makes more sense than comparing software to a precious metal. Bitcoin is a network, tiktok is a network, it's more similar then you think.

sure, can you give an an example  of any blockchain product that is a better product than what already exists and can you express why an average user of the existing product would switch? Do this without talking about the price of the coin increasing.



>Whether you think it's reached its absolute peak in value, will become worthless, or will stabilize, or remain volatile forever more is all opinion, conjecture and can't be stated with any kind of fact.

See this is the core problem, you think only in price but you can't express why any price is justified. I'm asking you to express why anyone would use a new product over a competitor they have already used their entire lives. 

>... this all started because I pointed out that as a store of value compared to gold, 12 years is 'early' considering gold has been used as a store of value for 5000 years. lol

Yes and I pointed out that a element is not the same thing as software, something that you haven't actually responded to. When comparing attributes, bitcoin is as similar to gold as it is to shit... In 5,000 years from now the Bitcoin software you can download today won't even function, Bitcoin might not even exist anymore, on the other hand gold will still be gold unless we do some pretty hardcore manipulation of atoms.


What you are saying is the kind of thing someone who doesn't actually understand the tech says, it's marketing buzzwords. Do you also think that Bitcoin let's people be their own bank, that's equally wrong...

&#x200B;

>You literally did, you said that I should use Bitcoin instead of my bank because it offers better returns than a savings account...

Well you're misusing the word 'literally' as I mentioned interest rates, I never once said ""numbers go up"" - which you quoted me as saying, and then doubled down on by saying I literally said it, when I *literally* didn't.

Technically interest rates are offered by exchanges not bitcoin per se... so there's that I guess. But those interest rates are still better than what a bank offers ( \~ 6% APY)

&#x200B;

>Yes and I pointed out that a element is not the same thing as software, something that you haven't actually responded to. 

Because no one claimed that bitcoin was an element. I still don't claim bitcoin is an element. People *liken* it to 'digital gold' generally, lazily perhaps.  You're making strawman arguements.

I agree with you, it's software. I already said I agreed with you. You're getting caught up in semantics. But it's software that society/culture has given as a store of value - which is why it's often compared to gold. 

&#x200B;

>See this is the core problem, you think only in price but you can't express why any price is justified.

Supply and demand, like any tradeable asset. I can't justify why a Pokemon card is worth $200k or why certain artwork is worth $millions. That it's digital code has pretty much nothing to do with it.

It's worth what anyone is willing to pay.

&#x200B;

>When comparing attributes, bitcoin is as similar to gold as it is to shit... 

Point to me where society and culture ever attributed shit as a store of value. Horseshit doesn't count.

>What you are saying is the kind of thing someone who doesn't actually understand the tech says, it's marketing buzzwords. Do you also think that Bitcoin let's people be their own bank, that's equally wrong...

I'm not marketing on trying to sell bitcoin to anyone. Like I said, I don't hold any and I wouldn't buy as an investment right now either. I do think blockchain has its uses though - I listed some of them.

Futures are moving higher this morning, with the Dow and S&P up about 0.4%. Nasdaq is 0.2% higher. This follows a rebound yesterday when tech booked major gains (Nasdaq rallied 1.8% and is now on track to break a four-week losing streak).

Another post-pandemic low in initial jobless claims yesterday does appear to have helped. Goes to show that just when you don’t see any catalysts for a rally, investors come in and bid things up. This tends to happen in bull markets. We’re still in a bull market. Probably will be for a little while.

Cryptos have even bounced a bit. On that note, hope you listened to the [weekly podcast with Jacob Ma-Weaver](https://contrarianpod.com/content/podcasts/season3/regulatory-risk-facing-cryptocurrencies-jacob-ma-weaver/) on crypto regulation. One thing we didn’t even speak about was the IRS. Yesterday the Treasury department came out and said there would be stricter tax reporting requirements. So regulation is coming for cryptos. Whether that removes their utility is another question.

Today we have purchasing manager surveys out at 0945. . That’s it for economic data releases. No major earnings reports either. May be a quiet day. May see more buying, as tends to happen in bull markets. Oh wait, I already said that.

Actually the whole conversation above started with ""Bitcoin is still early in discovery."", I refuted that by pointing out that it's 12 years old and as you agree it's digital which means it's well into it's life. I used examples like Instagram because those are other digital products that involve new forms of networks.

> Well you're misusing the word 'literally' as I mentioned interest rates, I never once said ""numbers go up"" - which you quoted me as saying, and then doubled down on by saying I literally said it, when I literally didn't.

Let's go back and look at what you actually said

>> I'm a normal Canadian, why would I ever use bitcoin over my current bank?
>>> Better interest savings accounts.


Sure looks like the only reason you can articulate why I should use bitcoin over a bank is that it acts as a better interest savings account when also conveniently we ignore risk. 




> Because no one claimed that bitcoin was an element. I still don't claim bitcoin is an element. People liken it to 'digital gold' generally, lazily perhaps. You're making strawman arguements.


I mean you did, if you want to liken it to a digital product then compare it to digital products... what's the average lifespan of a digital product again? how many digital products last even 20 years?


> I agree with you, it's software. I already said I agreed with you. You're getting caught up in semantics. But it's software that society/culture has given as a store of value - which is why it's often compared to gold.

So you agree this software will likely not exist in it's current form in even 20 years? not exactly a good store of value...


> Supply and demand, like any tradeable asset. I can't justify why a Pokemon card is worth $200k or why certain artwork is worth $millions. That it's digital code has pretty much nothing to do with it.

These are collectables, you never claimed bitcoin was a collectable, are you saying bitcoin is a collectable? Because I'll agree with that, how you describe it, bitcoin sure does seem pretty useless.


> It's worth what anyone is willing to pay.

If I find a sucker I can convince to but something at an inflated price that doesn't mean the price is going to stay that way forever. we are in a discussion about investing which means you actually have to justify your position. If your only argument is that ""Today someone will buy it"" then we know the price is likely going to go down at some point.


> Point to me where society and culture ever attributed shit as a store of value. Horseshit doesn't count.

You mean fertilizer? it's used several orders of magnitude more than Bitcoin. 



> I'm not marketing on trying to sell bitcoin to anyone. Like I said, I don't hold any and I wouldn't buy as an investment right now either. I do think blockchain has its uses though - I listed some of them.

The uses you listed are already done in a combination of better/faster/cheaper by other products that people already use on a daily basis. Again, you can't just express a use, you need to explain why it's better than the competition that's already used by almost the entire population. 

blockchain also has uses, sure. Anyone with a small amount of technical knowledge can make one in <2 hours. It's not like we are talking google search here, it's a combination of 3 concepts that we've known about for decades.


> Already stated, that those benefits don't appeal to you is your personal choice and I'm not here to change your mind. You quite clearly stated you don't give a shit about privacy, good for you.

So bitcoin has no uses for the average person?

Again, bitcoin does not offer privacy, it's pseudo anonymous, once someone can identity one transaction from you they can identify all transactions you made from the same wallet.






So to conclude, you have no expressed why a typical person would ever have a reason to use bitcoin or any crypto so that seems like you are talking a niche product. Doesn't seem like a good investment.",[],0
