Large scale battery deployments would be a game changer in smoothing out renewables' ability to become primary sources for our grid (in the US at least) by filling in demand gaps when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing.

Second figure out your appetite for loss.
Third figure out some 'what if scenarios' on a real platform. Etrade for example.


Fourth: pick a segment of the market which interests you. Cannabis, automotive, EVs, energy what ever piques your interest.

Fifth: watch a particular company ticker for a while.

Sixth: find other tools online. FinVis has helped many. YouTube it. Filter out the a-holes. Watch like 50 videos. Assemble your own knowledge base.

Step 7 : consistency!!

Make a plan and stick to it as the 8th step.

I personally believe the new leadership can do it. They‚Äôve already done an incredible job just in the last five months by paying down all debt, raising $500m (which is now $800m in cash on hand), setting up same-day delivery, setting up their esports department, and improving their customer service by moving the call support to the US from overseas.

If he sells a call he can offset the premium of the put, I get that. 
So if the price decreases, his put gain in value and his call is worthless so he would've effectively make profit. 

But if the price increases, his put would be worthless and he'd have to either deliver the underlying stock at a cheaper price (bc of the contract) or buy a call contract at a higher price (bc the spot price now increased) to close his position. So he would lose money. 

So selling calls would only be benificial to offset the put premium if the price decreases. Did I get the logic right?",[],0

A - It's still massively overvalued, regardless of what market you put it in
B - It's a car company.

> most Auto Companies haven‚Äôt sunk a fraction of the costs that Tesla have into clean energy or even electric vehicle technology

Ehhhh, not quite. Renault and Nissan have invested comparable amounts into their own EV divisions. Since most companies are working on an open standard for charging, they don't need to sell their own chargers or infra, they can rely on the industry standard. Tesla has to sell their own because they're going with the Apple route of having a special snowflake charger. That's cool and all but **they do not make any profits from their energy products or utilities, those are losses they eat to sell cars**.

> Tesla heavily out performs its competitors when it comes to money invested in driverless technology

I've addressed this in another comment. Tesla are not the only people who provide level 2 advanced driver assistance.

Let's pretend that everything you've said is correct. Would that still mean that Tesla sells all cars sold in the world for the next 10 years? Because that's what their current valuation would require.

Keep drinking the kool-aid all you like pal, ignore the competition all you like. I've bought my TSLA puts and I'm very happy with my results to date.

**Bottom line is this, and you retards don't seem to understand this: I am not saying Tesla is a shit company, I'm ASSUMING that it grows into the top 3 auto makers in the next 10-15 years. Even if they become the most successful car company in the world, and sell more cars than Ford, BMW, Nissan, and Toyota combined... the current share price for Tesla is too high.**

You retards don't seem to be smart enough to understand the nuance of what I'm saying so I'll give up on this thread. The stonk market is *slightly* more complicated than ""hurrr rdurrrrrrrr company good so stonk go up more"". It is entirely possible that a company is guaranteed to grow, but still be overvalued.

Fucking retards, whatever, keep buying, the P/E ratio is only 800 now, what a bargain...","['AAPL', 'TSLA']",1

OK, let's pretend that's true. That still makes Tesla overvalued as shit. If we assume they sell 90% of the cars sold in the world... their share price is still too high. This is not a question of ""Tesla good"" or ""Tesla bad"", or me claiming they're not going to grow like they claim they will, the car market is simply not big enough to justify their share price as it is today.

> I don‚Äôt know any other car manufacturers that are actually developing that technology

Then you should shut the fuck up and start doing some research before spouting useless, uninformed opinions. Literally every car company is working on *advanced driver assistance* (that's what they call it, since ""self-driving"" is a fucking pipe-dream that only retards fall for).

> Tesla is the only one out there right now,

Uhhh no, again, every big car company is working on advanced driver assistance, some Volvos can park themselves, and overtake on motorways, just like Teslas.

> Autonomous cars will take over from drivers and once again Tesla is the winning horse in that field

A - Fully autonomous driving is a pipe-dream. I say that as a software engineer with a masters in AI. Tesla themselves are backpedaling on self-driving claims.

B - Tesla have only reached level-2, just like Volvo and Nissan.

https://www.telecomtv.com/content/automotive/canalys-8-of-new-cars-in-europe-sold-with-level-2-autonomy-driving-features-36247/

Have you done literally zero research on this? I'm not even going into the latest research here, this is fucking basic shit...

The company can do whatever they want behind those front doors, but if the trend is moving away from movie theaters and towards streaming, there's not a whole lot any movie theater CEO can do. 30-40 years ago, phone companies made their money on phone land lines. Technology shifted this towards internet and cellular, and the phone companies became broadband internet and cellular companies in response. Technology threatens the movie theater experience in much the same way. A monumental blow was the decision to offer box office new releases direct to streaming on day 1. There's talk of pulling back on that post-pandemic, but the threat remains.

I'm only one person, so you may view this as anecdotal, but seriously look up the trend away from theaters and towards streaming, it began in 2018-2019, long before the pandemic. I personally have gone to movie theaters less and less over the last 20 years, from 1-2 visits per month in the 2000's to 3-4 per year in 2010-2015, to 0-1 per year 2015-2020. It also doesn't mean I just never go out, I just don't consider a movie a ""going out"" activity anymore, it's been replaced by zoos, snowboarding, go-karts, golf driving range (Top Golf is fun as hell for non-golf-types), carnivals, apple orchards, hiking, outdoor concerts, beach volleyball... etc etc etc. Movies are: get some popcorn going, rent a new release to play on my 65"" tv with surround sound in the basement. My next home will have a dedicated theater in the basement with an 85""+ sized screen and even better sound.

Again, let me reiterate, while that's a lot of personal preference, I am part of the statistics that clearly show a trend away from movie theaters over the last 3-4 years.",[],0

You can't even comprehend the basics explanation and various examples I gave you. You can't even understand the various papers that explain why it is an index of fear and why it was given that name. Do you think people pulled that name out of their ass just for the fun of it? How dumb are you seriously?

You bought $1000 of a stock valued at $10 each
You sold at a worth of $900, when the stock was valued at $9, losing $100
You rebought $1000 worth of that stock at $8 each
Your $100 loss is added to the cost of your repurchase, so in the IRS eyes you paid $1100 for that $1000 worth of stock

Once you sell again (and wait 30 days), your loss/gain amount is exactly what it would have been if no wash sale occurred.

>It seems to me to be equally plain that no business which depends for   
existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right   
to continue in this country. 

This should not be arguable - if your workers qualify for social assistance then you're a *cost* to the economy, not a benefit, and should close (or at least be on the hook for that social assistance). It's a direct cost to you as a consumer that happens every day - you are directly subsidizing these companies and their behaviour.

>The increase of wages will not help anyone as it will just trickle down   
to most corporates bottom line and you know the boards are not willing   
to take less so they'll just push it to the consumer which repeats the   
cycle.

Your point here is that companies will raise the prices, but there is still competition; the often quoted statistic is the price of a big mac in Denmark, where the wages and taxes are significantly higher (It's $4.87 in Denmark and $5.66 on average in the US, incidentally). Unless literally everywhere raises their prices at the same time, anyone who does will be at a competitive disadvantage. In reality, prices would rise a bit and settle into a new equilibrium.

The health of the economy is based around the velocity of money. Every dollar that goes to someone who will spend it is worth far more than one that's sitting in a bank account somewhere. Raising the minimum wage will do way more for the US economy than giving companies billions in tax breaks.",[],0

The problem with stock like apple is that they were trading at around 80$ just before COVID, and now it's around 125$ and the business hasn't improved to that same degree. Rather it got overbought with all the stimulus money and easy credit and so on, like pretty much most of the tech sector. AMD similar story as well I'd say, but I'd buy after the correction is done.

It is not reasonable that overnight this technology that hasn‚Äôt been super profitable yet will miraculously increase they‚Äôre earnings 500x or 1000x.

There is also a chance they end up trying to pursue smaller jets rather than go in commercial. Lots of possibilities. Then you also have other companies in the same space seeking a quad copter approach towards regional transportation, like 4 to 500 miles. But this is not what the valuation stems from, I am just speaking in the very long term

2. You do realize that the biggest companies on the NASDAQ all at times had similar ratios? Go look at what Amazons was. Pointing to a high ratio is like the dumbest fucking argument because it completely ignores the fact that skyhigh ratios exist for a reason. Expectations of growth. What do you think will happen to the ratio when Austin and Berlin are both fully online? 

3. Just because you can refer past bubbles doesn‚Äôt mean that this is a bubble.

Let me leave you with one final thought. When you look at the cost per car, most of that is due to battery costs. Tesla has battery technology they will provide higher power output and density per dollar than its competitors in a huge way. Then, on top of that, you take into account the economies of scale they are going to achieve, and low cost they are going to achieve with the casting machines. What you get is a car body that is cheaper then the competitors, with battery technology that can provide the same range, acceleration, and longevity for a far cheaper price. Add to that the insurance angle and you have a total car that can be produced far more cheaply than anyone else, the profit margin‚Äòs will be very high. 

And this ignores the energy sector, this ignores the software angle. This ignores the fact that dojo will soon be the most powerful dumb AI in the world for creating dumb AI solutions to other things. This ignores the fact that tesla can play it‚Äôs engineer and and battery advantages into many more fields.",['TSLA'],0
