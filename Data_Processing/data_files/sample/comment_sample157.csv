""**So we are quite committed to this business, but anyone in this business should be scared. And if they aren't scared, you should
be scared because we are taking significant capital risk and most of the folks in the space are losing tons of money and you have to have a clear
path to profit.** So you have to know exactly how scale is going to let you renovate homes more efficiently. You have to know exactly how you're
going to be able to market those homes directly to the buyer. And it's hard to pull apart because when you're growing really fast, you're paying
forward some of your growth and that limits your margins, but you're also trying to get more efficient. And whenever you're going to get more
efficient and grow at the same time, it's just a real challenge. And so we're just trying to be eyes wide open about those risks, and I think that's the
way you would want us to be. And what drives me crazy about this space is that almost everybody in the space accounts for their margins differently,
which makes it hard for you to give an apples-to-apples comparison of who's really making money and who's losing money and how much money
they're losing. That's the reason we invented accounting principles. I wish we would use them more consistently.""

I'm holding back alot of rambling and word vomit but the pickings are probably as follows:

TSM - Making chips is an incredibly difficult process and as chips get more and more advanced those who actually have the capacity to make them are going to hit it big in the future. TSM has already commited to this recently with their 100b plan and are set to make the majority of the world's computer chips. They are reputable and have decades of CPU manufacturing experience under their belt. But again it's place outside of the US is often a big deterrent for investors.

AMD - Consistently hits milestones and steadily growing, far from outing intel on it's PC home turf but they have been chipping away at intel's grip on the market and intel has been slow to respond in any meaningful way on all fronts.

These are probably the big two I see going up, but the technology sector is all about innovation and whoever gets the next big thing out first is going to be the winner hands down.

House:  We owe $400k with 13 years left on a low interest 15 year mortgage.  It would sell for $860k (but we're not selling).  
Checking: $115k  
High-yield savings: $450k (currently earning a laughable .4%)  
No debt besides house.  
  
Knowing my wife's risk aversity, I've been pushing to pay off the mortgage.  That would save us around $950/month in mortgage interest, and the principal savings of course.  That would leave us with $165k cash as emergency fund which would grow quickly at our income level.  That's more than enough, but not enough for my wife.

> I disagree with the argument about tech companies though. A tech company is, even if more risky, creating something physical.

Not to be pedantic, but tech companies don't actually create anything ""physical"". The software that a SaaS company sells is not meaningfully different conceptually to crypto - the value is in the intellectual property, which is manifested as software. To the extent that a crypto project has real utility (i.e. ethereum smart contracts, helium LoRa network, IOTA M2M micro-payments, etc.), it is very similar to tech company investment - you're assessing what you think the utility and future growth potential of the technology are and investing based on that.

298,gzea63q,2021-05-25,t1_gzdw6cf,investing,"Thanks u/irresponsible_owl.  He summed up O pretty well, so I will concentrate on STAG.

STAG Industrial is a self-managed REIT that focuses on acquiring and leasing industrial properties across the U.S. It has an enterprise value of over $7B, and owns 494 total properties across 39 states, covering 99.1M square feet. What sets STAG apart from its peers Prologis (PLD), Duke Realty (DRE), and Rexford Industrial (REXR) is its focus on secondary markets, which are less competitive and come with higher cap rates.  
  
Rather than blindly bidding on ‘hot properties’ in Tier 1 markets, STAG takes an analytically-driven approach towards sourcing and acquiring properties that produce the best risk-adjusted returns. This is supported by the 1,250 transactions that passed initial triage for investment consideration in 2020, of which only 224 transactions were underwritten, of which an even fewer 39 transactions actually closed. This means that only 3% of the initially sourced transactions were finally acquired.  
  
STAG’s management can afford to be choosy, as it operates in a highly fragmented market that’s $1 Trillion in size, of which STAG’s share represents just 0.5%. As an acquirer of single-tenant properties (hence the letters ST in STAG), STAG also operates from an advantageous position. That’s because it’s able to spread the so-called ‘binary risk’ of single tenant properties across its asset base of nearly 500 properties.  
  
As such, while a single-tenant property is risky to a private owner of one or just a few properties, it has far more value for STAG, as it’s able to manage the risk of tenant defaults across its sea of properties. This results in the mispricing of assets, which STAG is keen to take advantage of.  
  
This, combined with the secondary market focus, has resulted in profitable growth for the company, which has a 5.3% implied cap rate, comparing favorably to the 3.9% peer average. Meanwhile, STAG has a well-diversified and strong tenant base, of which 86% have annual revenue over $100M, and 61% have revenue over $1B. As seen below, STAG’s top 10 tenants represent just 12.5% of the portfolio ABR (annual base rent) with Amazon (AMZN) being the top tenant, along with other well-regarded names such as XPO Logistics (XPO), FedEx (FDX), and WestRock (WRK).",[],0

End of 20s use savings to move to a diff city for hugely better career prospect.

333,gzecqvi,2021-05-25,t1_gzdx2l2,investing,"I think this is a conversation you should both have with a neutral party, a financial adviser.

Money matters are a big source of marital discord, and you want to ensure that both of you are equally informed and equal partners in making financial decisions, rather than equally uninformed.

As much money as you have, understand that every dollar of principal you lose is PV \* (1 + r)^(nt) future dollars gone forever, and time is one thing you cannot buy back.

There is a serious liquidity crisis on the horizon, very likely in the next 12 to 18 months, and it could obliterate the $150k you're seeking to invest if suddenly you need some portion of that $150k.  For reference, the crash of 2000 saw market value decline by 75% and market indicators are pointing in much the same direction as they were in 2000.  So this also bears impact on the totality of your investment/retirement capital.... every penny counts.

When people use expressions like ""I've finally convinced her to..."" it doesn't tell me that you both equally understand the risks involved, and right now the risks are high.  I can tell you from personal experience that this can mushroom quickly into a marriage ending event, through no action or inaction of your own.  You are putting yourselves at the mercy of the market at a time when uncertainty looms and, worse, there's almost nowhere to shelter money from inflation because interest rates are so low.

For me, risk averse doesn't mean not taking risks but it means understanding that if I lose 30% of my portfolio, I have to generate an improbable 42% return on the remaining capital just to break even, by which time I've lost a year (or fourteen, in the case of the 2000 crash)... So it sounds like paying down the house ($400k is a lot to owe on a house, unless you are a billionaire) may be your first priority but you perhaps need a professional to articulate the scenarios to both of you so that you're fully aligned on the risks of A vs. B vs. C.",[],0

>How do you come up with a fair value of 14$ per share?

DCF analysis using the Free Cash Flow method.

>How is earning a lot of money the antithesis of investing or a long term investment strategy?

Risk vs. reward.  The total risk alpha of DPZ is -0.03Putting all of your money into one stock (e.g. Dominoes) and then touting an extremely volatile stock like GME which has only swung in the last year or so is not an investing strategy, particularly not when we look at Graham's definition of investing:

>An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return.  Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.

Over the period involved the maximum drawdown of DPZ was -26.67%.  The volatility of DPZ is roughly twice that of the market, so without the luxury of hindsight the odds are that this investment could have seriously backfired.

So as far as we understand, you held one stock for ten years and got very lucky... We don't have a history of complex portfolio decisions from 2010-2020, but you mention Nike and Adidas (over what period?) and then you jump into GME which is far from an undervalued stock...

Keep in mind thus far we're taking you at your word.  But the idea that GME has anything in common with value investing is so far removed from reality that it invites further scrutiny upon your other claims.

Complications not covered: how old are these individuals? Did they have time to extract capital gains from the last few decades? How much wealth is tied up in their primary residence? How much benefited from non-inherited wealth? (e.g., how many were able to get an education without going into debt due to parental support?)

Such a thing is unlikely to make a lasting difference to the overall trajectory of a large cap company.... a larger company requires more than just normal news to move the stock (Amazon, great example.... blowout earnings report that temporarily shifted the stock price, then back on the same chart that it had been on within a few days).

Effectively creating a personalized vaccine for a multitude of cancers.

No they aren't; that's a ridiculous claim easily disproven. A net worth of $1 million (which includes home equity and retirement) will put you in the 88th percentile (i.e. top 12%) of the US by wealth. That's not a majority of the middle class, by any stretch.

>So as far as we understand, you held one stock for ten years

Initially I bought one stock, exactly. I was a broke uni student. What do you expect? That I buy a diversified portfolio of dividend stocks and earn 50 quid in 5 years?

>... and got very lucky

Arguable. I had reasons for making the initial decisions and had checkpoints in place, which I also described in the initial point. Calling it ""luck"" is discrediting the thorough analysis necessary to find a company like those mentioned, as well as the understanding necessary to grasp how and when a digital transformation looks promising.

>Are you telling us that you only held Nike, then you only held Adidas, then you only held Dominos

Obviously not. Only someone being intentionally obtuse could assume this. I even said I bought Dominos in 2010 and held for ten years as my first investment as a student. This takes us to 2020. How could I have possibly held Nike and Adidas and Netflix for multiple years if they would have been my only investments? Is that really how you argue? Strawmanning my argument and ad hominems? 

If you want to go back and read the first post again? I lead with my style of investing: **pick companies that are entering digital transformations.** I believe that we are at in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution, and that it will fundamentally change the way we live our lives. Only companies acknowledging this change, and adapting to it will be successful. If you want to talk more about this thesis, I am happy to have this discussion, but you will have to leave your personal attacks out.

Lastly, re: ""definition of investing"":

What you are advocating for, is not investing at all: It is longish term trading.

If you want to I'll use the same Graham quote as you. You failed at the first hurdle: 
>upon thorough analysis

You did not do a thorough analysis. You did a DCF, which i specifically said will not work, and called it a day! 
A DCF assumes the business will continue doing things as it is. A **digital transformation** is the exact opposite of doing same old same old.

It feels to me as if you, since you're a moderator in an online forum on investing, think you are the ultimate authority on investing, which is absurd on a good day.

The difference is demand was drying up back then, tons of people were looking for work, commodity/asset prices weren't skyrocketing(they were tanking), and companies struggled to sell goods.

Now, we have:

- Asset and commodity prices skyrocketing

- Businesses can't find workers

- shortages of all sorts of things from semiconductors to chlorine to lumber

- demand through the roof on everything due to stimulus and more consumption leaning towards products rather than experiences/services

- supply chain disruptions due to covid restrictions.

The benefit of starting the process at birth rather than waiting until they enter the workforce and begin paying into social security is that there is more time for compounding to occur. 

$10,000 per person is definitely too low, but say $10,000 at birth, reduced by $1,000 per year = $55,000 contribution per person, which grows into $2.76 million after 65 years at just 6.5% annually (no assumptions about inflation however, but that initial pay-in could be indexed to inflation).

I'd much rather pay $55,000 now than $2.75 million in 65 years. But our current mood politically precludes doing anything according to a long-term plan, and legislation enacted during one presidency can easily be reversed 4 years later. And this would be an easy target, considering taxes would be being collected to fund a system that would probably not benefit very many of the people currently paying into it.

If goods and services were becoming cheaper every year, at SOME point people would want to buy things, because the prices would be too good to pass up. I think the decline in velocity is more an effect of covid and money printing. It doesn't make a lot of sense to hold inflating dollars, but there may be reasons we can't understand, like uncertainty, that are causing people to sav a lot more than normal. Salary disparity isn't the main driver of inequality, because raw salaries don't actually very that much, with the bottom being around $16 K, and the median being about $ 50 K. my vote would be for technology and the money printer, since tech platforms tend to be winner take all, funneling vast wealth to the owners of top tech companies, and the rampant creation of additional currency units just drops insane wealth into the hands of anyone who owns property or assets. Anyone who owned a house for the last 20 years is up several times their initial cost, and now even used cars are starting to go up in value instead of down, even though its the type of asset that wears out. That is why we are in another K shaped recovery, like 2008, where those who have invested assets in good inflation hedges or growth stocks are just doubling their wealth every year, and normal people got a stimmy check that they either blew on crap, or are hoarding like Smaug, unaware of its rapid decline in relative value.",[],0

Having said that, a lot of dividend investors do well because they have a plan and the stick to it (many fail to do that).

Looking at their annual investment report, I see:

|Cash Equivalents|31.2bn||
|:-|:-|:-|
|Derivatives|.535 bn||
|Debt Securities|106 bn||
|Equity|189 bn||
|Rel Estate|37 bn||
|private debt|.454 bn||
|private equity|23.39 bn||
|infrastructure|3.4bn||
|forestland|1.2bn||

I'm obviously just a random person, but to me it seems like A) they should be contributing a whole lot more given their current investment mix and the returns they've been getting from it, and B) they should give serious though to the book David Swensen wrote (formerly manager of Yales Endowment) in Pioneering Portfolio Management, namely that bonds are wholly inappropriate for perpetual entities.

Yes, on the surface 6.3% annualized over 20 years is right inline with the markets return, but consider that they did this with such a huge overhang of bonds that are nearly all return far less than that. Yale, for instance, returned 9.9% annually over 20 year, and that number was from the near market lows of June 30, 2020.

So, underfunding, and holding a huge proportion of investments whose expected returns are far less than the expected return of the fund are the two big issues facing CALPERS.

Redistribution will not fix the root cause of the issue.

For the US this has to be true. Black people were enslaved then subjected to Jim Crow. It’ll take time to bridge the wealth gap in the US. 

Wealth inequality in general is not a race issue though. **Wealth inequality is a feature of agricultural based societies.** There has never been an agricultural based society in history that has solved the wealth distribution issue so the inequality looks different in each society.

724,gzf27jl,2021-05-25,t3_njg0vr,investing,"Notable investor Ray Dalio, in explaining the market, talks about debt cycles in combination with innovation as a good first approximation of the way the markets work.

When it comes to innovation we can go farther back than a few years. We can go to true history rather than recent events. Innovation has been occurring for thousands of years. If you go from -3000 BC to -2000 BC not much changes in civilization, but if you go from 1900 AD to 2000 AD a huge amount of innovation occurs. With a few more data points it becomes obvious that the pace of innovation has been accelerating. Notable moments like the invention of writing, the printing press, and assembly lines show this. So to do numerous points in the development of mathematics, for example, queue theory and its impact on our work processes.

If Ray Dalio's simple model was right, why is it that the pace of innovation is so high now, but was not so high in the past?

In previous times people felt that there was no progress. You'll sometimes hear people talk about the belief in progress as a recent thing. This is like talking about growing infection rates as startling, because there wasn't much growth when the input as low, but there was a lot when the input got higher.

Your asking why people are paying attention to Cathie, but it would be easier to approach this by talking about why some people aren't paying attention to her.

Younger people who are aware of technology are more aware of the trend. Older people tend to struggle to use computers and don't quite grasp it. For a younger person who uses computers it is obvious that computers can, in hours, do better than what previously took a hundred lifetimes of human genius to accomplish. AlphaZero is a great example of this, both because it is does this literally, and because its name symbolically approached the idea of a starting point; it isn't named OmegaInfinity. Why, if you can't even use the technology to see its fruits, would you suppose that the innovation line has continued to show further and further advancement? So of course you would dismiss the people who proclaim innovation, since your model would not include the innovation, because you can't see it.

We're seeing that the trend of innovation doesn't demand linear change. Cathie espouses this and so gets attention. For older people who are blind to the why it may seem mysterious why she would get this attention. After all, isn't it coming from her results? If you are blind, you are blind to the fact that it is not because of her results, but instead that her results are a product of the underlying trends and people are following those trends rather than her.

Now people project an amount of progress which seems farfetched to those who gaze at the past without an eye for the calculus. We can see that not only does innovation occur, but that the rate of growth is modeled by equations which aren't linear. We suppose we are not on Ray Dalio's gentle linear innovation line. What we are on is better modeled by Cathie's appeal to Wright's law. So she gets attention.

It is targeted at the forces involved as they pertain to software engineering with the idea of harnessing them to improve our work and to simplify how we can think about that work, but the general idea goes beyond the field: https://joshuacol.es/2020/03/06/modeling-technical-income.html",[],0

* You start at $40k at age 25 and work your way up to $60k at 5% a year, and then top out at $60k for like 25 years without a raise.
* You're saving the recommended 15% of income towards retirement.
* You never bought a house, so your assets outside of retirement accounts are essentially 0.
* The market returns 5%.

10% retirement savings instead of 15%?  $705,232

You get 1% a year raises after hitting $60k? $1,588,772

873,gzff8gv,2021-05-25,t1_gzf6yeu,investing,"Are you intentionally being obtuse?

People hoard money, which takes it out of circulation.   

Say you live on an island with 100 coconuts on it.  The richest person on the island has 50 percent of them, 'cause the trees are on his land.  The rest of the people on the island have access to the other 50.  The rich person's wealth is tied up in 50 of those coconuts, which can be traded later, so keeps them for a rainy day.

That leaves only 50% of the coconuts left for trading.  If another person invents a business selling fish, people trade their coconuts for fish.  They go into the fisherman's house, and he holds another 25.  That leaves the entire economy swapping only 25 coconuts.

The velocity of money slows down every time someone holds a coconut and choses not to spend it.

When consumer spending is high, the velocity of money is high because people don't feel the need to hoard or keep their money in the bank.  

When consumer spending is low, the velocity contracts.  Everyone holds tight to their money.  The coconuts are removed from circulation.

If you allow the supply of coconuts in circulation to fall to zero, the economy of the island drops to zero.  

Yes, it's a limited example, but the same thing happens in the real world.  Billionaires hold billions in their account - often as an interest in their own empire, and no matter how they're spending, that money is removed from circulation.

This does support the earlier claim (that a good chunk of affluent individuals don't receive as much direct inheritance as the common wisdom suggests).

That's because

1) inflation causes us to have a lot more millionaires with each new generation. A much higher % of the population are millionaires now than 80 years ago.

2) a million dollars isn't that much for a middle class couple who have worked and saved their whole lives. So yes, a high % of that group is 'self made' (whatever that means, see #3), but what % of those with $50+m were born into a family outside the top 10%?

3) 'self made' is a loose term. if it simply means your parents weren't millionaires, then see #1.

If stimulus slows down, infrastructure proposals get stuck in congress, and the fed slows down bond purchases, I think inflation would indeed be transitory.

If congress decides to pass more stimulus and infrastructure spending, and the federal reserve stays their course, it could be lasting inflation as well.",[],0

I feel like the basic concept of index funds is relatively straightforward and it's a matter of sitting down to understand it, but I'm willing to accept that it doesn't come naturally to a lot of people. Still, I imagine there are wealth managers who can advise such people.

It just seems like such a silly reason for wealth to dissipate. It's almost hard to believe.",[],0
964,gzfnh1d,2021-05-25,t1_gzfm2su,investing,"> I want to highlight that being privileged is not the only way (or a guaranteed to way) to succeed in the US

i agree. but if you acknowledge the existence of privilege, then you acknowledge that success is much easier for some people than others - that's what privilege is.

> I guess I’m trying to bring some positivity into this thread - it’s pretty depressing talking to a lot of y’all honestly.

i don't think you need to fudge the facts in order to be positive - if you're black and trans and disabled and grew up with one parent in a neighborhood with crap schools, *shit's going to be much harder for you,* but that doesn't mean you can't be very successful. it just means you'll have to work a lot harder than, say, me.",[],0

I have a middle income job of $40k/yearly and am considering investing it to open a Jiu-Jitsu school (teaching it for 10+ years at another school). As exciting as it is, I would rather find out if there is a better way to invest that money (should take about 25-30k to start the school, but still) if there is a better financial yield, and keep Jiu-Jitsu as a side hobby still. Any thoughts?",[],0
