Comments from White House Fact Sheet (May 18 - link above)

- The American Jobs Plan recognizes that EVs are important to the future of a strong American manufacturing base. **Securing the domestic production of EV parts, like batteries, also represents an opportunity** to shore up U.S competitiveness in a growing market, **bolster our domestic supply chain**, and create good-paying jobs in the U.S. — union jobs.

- **Incentivize the start-up of new battery production facilities**: The President’s plan proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States, recognizing that new businesses may not be able to access tax credits but can pitch in their fair share as they scale their operations.

- Scale up federally-funded research and development: The American Jobs Plan will **invest $35 billion in transformative research and development for energy and climate related topics**, of which $15 billion is specifically set aside for the Department of Energy, a leader in applied clean energy research, **including advanced batteries**. It will also invest $40 billion to upgrade research infrastructure such as laboratories and networks.

Granted Hemp fusion retails into 4000 locations and Love Hemp is in 2000 Love Hemp plans to be in 6 countries and within 1 day delivery of a billion people by year end Hey I love Hempfusion its a great company but as you guys Love CBD already why not get in on LoveHemp as well as it seems like a massive bargain at the moment youtube.com/watch?v=RwLwV3g...

338,gymy4k2,2021-05-19,t1_gymvzbp,pennystocks,"So if you’re bullish on a stock, and you want to sell an option you would sell a put. Generally a cash secured put (meaning between the premium you collect and the cash in your account you have enough available cash to secure buying 100 shares of the underlying at the given strike price). You *can* sell naked, but don’t. I would sell a put if I think the stock is going up or remaining flat, so if ATOS is $3.30/share and I sell a $3.00 put, I keep all the premium if it’s above $3.00/share at expiration. Exercising an option, in this case a short dated call on ATOS that’s already in the money (ITM), involves buying 100 shares of the underlying at the strike price. So your cost is the strike price (say $2.50) x 100 + the premium you originally paid for the option. If I paid $.20 per context my cost basis would be $2.70 per share for those 100 shares. Generally it only makes sense to exercise early if there’s very little premium left on the option, otherwise it would be financially more beneficial to simply sell the option contract, collect that premium, then buy 100 shares. Example: pay $.20 for the same call option, sell that contract before expiry for $1.05 ($105 because $1.05x100), so I’ve netted $85. If ATOS is at $3.30/share I buy 100 shares for $330 but I can subtract that profit from my cost basis, so 330-85 = $245 or $2.45/share. Better than the early exercise in that case. Hope that helps.",[],0

358,gyn0clu,2021-05-19,t1_gyhqbqn,pennystocks,"You sound super salty. Maybe MEDXF is a decent play, maybe it’s not. Denigrating CTXR doesn’t substantiate anything about MEDXF.

CTXR’s Mgmt team reads like an all star lineup & they have retained ownership in a significant % of shares. They have also positioned CTXR to pursue novel products in areas of need & they crushed phase 2 trials. There is a clear path to unique product in an area of need.

Despite dilution, the number of shares outstanding is still super low. Lower still when you subtract out institutional ownership.

MEDXF appears to be a small cap competing in highly competitive, saturated markets.

Low volume is a reflection of low potential for significant market share capture.

Throwing $5-$10k at CTXR has a decent chance of being a multi bagger if mino-Lok hits.

Comparatively, MEDXF does not appear to be  positioned for exponential growth. Small cap value plays don’t get folks excited. Too many things can happen to crush value that are outside their control.

You seem confused as to why the two companies are treated differently.

You forgot to mention that the defense's main argument was centered around an 8K that they claim ""proved"" they were responsibly operating a business... illegally. It was at least an hour after this that the judge had to point out that the attorney for the defense had never entered that supposedly vital piece of material as evidence. 

You also forgot that the expert witness presented by the defense was unable to answer the most basic questions about the company, including whether or not they had filed their taxes for the last two years, or even name a single one of the twelve employees she testified to working with for long hours every day for the past few years. 

The defense attorney asked multiple questions based on incorrect facts, and became noticeably flustered when the errors were pointed out to him. He also, at one point, had to be coached by the judge because he was unable to reword his own question in a way that wouldn't be immediately objected to (and sustained).

Was George a shining star? No, of course not. He became obviously impatient with the defense attorney, and he talked too much, including answering questions directed to his own attorney.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

As the judge pointed out, the company is on trial here. The fact that Sharp's emails don't sound professional really has nothing to do with whether or not the company is active. The testimony of the comptroller — at least when she wasn't being questioned by friendly counsel — was embarassing.

569,gyo546j,2021-05-19,t3_nfu4fo,pennystocks,"LAC - Thacker Pass should be the best sedimentary Lithium asset in North America. Ganfeng just announced they may build a battery plant in Argentina where they also own a Lithium mine w/ LAC. Potentially huge news. I personally like their Arizona plant a lot though (Thacker Pass) as the US wants to get their metals here. It's been called a matter of national security. PLL & LTHM are of interest here also.

PDAC - SPAC taking Li-Cycle public, which has amazing technology and connections.

WWR - Graphite (and USA). 

ABML - Another recycler with some great tech located near Tesla.

NNOMF - Nano One has technology that auto manufacturers need. For further reading look up their NMC811 breakthrough technology. 

I'm biased as I have all of these stocks. They've done really well for me and I hope they move higher soon. Most have been amazing for me. They've all been hit really hard lately. LAC is one of my favorites but you won't get rich overnight with it and they won't be producing until next year. That said, it has a lot of $20-$30 targets on it and it they should be coming online as Lithium demand continues to surge. IMO PDAC got crushed with all the other SPACs but is a solid company. ABML & NNOMF probably have very bright futures. ABML was .20 not long ago and it is shooting for NASDAQ up-listing in 2021. You can't be green without recycling. WWR was $12 not long ago. 

Oh, be sure to check out TSNP & GOMRF for rare earth.. 

Lots of great companies in this space. If they start to perform anything like they did a few months ago again soon, I'll be really happy.",[],1

Amedeo Air Four Plus Ltd. said Wednesday that Thai Airways International PCL's rehabilitation plan has been approved by the creditors committee. 

The London-listed specialist fund --which acquires, leases and sells aircraft-- said that it will now continue to negotiate and agree binding lease-amendment documentation with the airline on a power-by-the-hour basis. The company said it will do this before moving to a fixed-rate lease for the remaining term, including an extension from the original term. 

Amedeo said it continued to target June or July to document and effect the restructuring of debt with its lenders. 

Early in May the board said that it believed that the eventual resumption of Thai Airways' payments, as well as an agreement on long-term debt restructuring, would result in Amedeo being in a stronger position than if it allowed the debt to default, which would result in the repossession of aircraft leased to the airline.",[],1

770,gyox7js,2021-05-19,t3_nfa07g,pennystocks,"Ideanomics, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDEX) shareholders will have a reason to smile today, with the covering analyst making substantial upgrades to this year's forecasts. Consensus estimates suggest investors could expect greatly increased statutory revenues and earnings per share, with the analyst modelling a real improvement in business performance. The market seems to be pricing in some improvement in the business too, with the stock up 9.7% over the past week, closing at US$2.83. Could this big upgrade push the stock even higher?  
  
Following the upgrade, the current consensus from analysts is for revenues of US$129m in 2021 which - if met - would reflect a substantial 119% increase on its sales over the past 12 months. The loss per share is anticipated to greatly reduce in the near future, narrowing 84% to US$0.05. However, before this estimates update, the consensus had been expecting revenues of US$105m and US$0.11 per share in losses. We can see there's definitely been a change in sentiment in this update, with the analyst administering a sizeable upgrade to this year's revenue estimates, while at the same time reducing their loss estimates.  
  
Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. For example, we noticed that Ideanomics' rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with revenues forecast to exhibit 184% growth to the end of 2021 on an annualised basis. That is well above its historical decline of 2.6% a year over the past five years. Compare this against analyst estimates for the broader industry, which suggest that (in aggregate) industry revenues are expected to grow 13% annually. So it looks like Ideanomics is expected to grow faster than its competitors, at least for a while.",[],0
