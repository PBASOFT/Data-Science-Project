People blame the stocks, market rotations and any short term media induced noise instead of taking a step back and realizing you are investing for the long term and that means patience. 

Practical advice is make sure you actually understand the risk and volatility of your portfolio. Most would fail here because we think we know until things go to shit and then you're freaking out. There's a reason over half of my portfolio is in index funds. Not because I think they'll provide a higher return (yes I know this is debatable) but mainly because I don't want 5% daily swings.

* very high mass density of energy.
* Electrolysis is simple and can help solve problems with unreliable renewable energy generation.

Cons of hydrogen compared to battery:

* low volumetric density of energy -- very difficult to store.
* Hydrogen distribution is pretty piss poor.
* Round trip efficiency of hydrogen is poor. Power -> hydrogen -> power loses a ton, especially if you add distribution costs and storage inefficiencies (compression or liquifying).
* Most cost effective way of generating hydrogen isn't electrolysis, it's using methane, which isn't exactly green. Also shows how inefficient electrolysis really is.
* Most efficient way of generating power is from fuel cells which require exotic metals, much more so than batteries (there is research on both sides done to minimize this cost).

360,gz17wqj,2021-05-22,t3_ni16t3,stocks,"Here‚Äôs a few suggestions.

1) use bonds, etfs and a few ‚Äúboomer‚Äù stocks. 

2) if your stock or etf is trending up and it dips, this is usually hedge funds/MM stop loss hunting. Companies will sell. People will shit themselves, like yourself, and sell. Then those firms will buy back in. This is illegal in most cases but rarely enforced and usually the media will provide a scapegoat for those companies (I.e ‚Äúfears that the migrant caravan, causes S&P500 to drop 5% in the last week‚Äù) 

3) stop looking at your account every 5 seconds. 99% of the profit you‚Äôll make is through after hours trading and trends that you miss out on if you sell. Seriously. If you buy a stock without being 100% convinced that it‚Äôs a stock that‚Äôll go up, you‚Äôll sell if it drops 25%

4) ‚Äúnever‚Äù use leverage (I personally use a 2x leverage on a bunch of my trades and then use excess money to extend the Stoploss/margin call, but if you‚Äôre not certain or sure then don‚Äôt use leverage). 

5) don‚Äôt throw good money after bad. Just because a stock drops 25% in a month doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll immediately rocket up again. Investing in consolidating stocks, deep or under valued plays and balancing that will stable stocks,bonds and etfs to maintain capital is better than chucking your savings at half a dozen sinking companies and praying that one of them does a 10 bagger.

6) your biggest focus should be on capital preservation, then making profit, then limiting losses. Keeping your position sizes to 7.5-5% or less and DCA (dollar cost averaging) into plays can help ease those dips and balance out your capital. Even tho lump sum investing does make more profit. Gradually investing in 1/4 chunks or 1/3 chunks means if a stock dips 10% you can still break even by investing your capital as it dips, then your positions you invested at a lower price can be compounded by selling at the point the stock breaks even and investing in another play/saving. Or holding if you feel like it.

7) if none of these appeal to you, just invest in VTI and VOO and stay away from the casino. The years you‚Äôll save on your life probably outweigh the profits you‚Äôll make trading. I‚Äôm not a boglehead but they seem happier üòÇ",[],0

I agree. We'll see how long it takes until Oatly is a true consumer's staple.

I am also consuming oat milk since a few years (seems like a good base for Oatly and the likes if so many people like you and I are drinking it, eh?). I find there are differences in terms of taste - of course you have to pay a premium for Oatly compared to e.g. the store's own brand, so I went with them, but sadly they lack the creaminess and are rather bland (not nutty). There's only one brand that comes close to Oatly and they also produce a lot of other milk substitutes like cashew etc. But obviously subjective, just my two cents.

400,gz1a72e,2021-05-22,t3_lv5dlb,stocks,"Hello, I'm very new into investing. Here's what happened with me:  
I bought some shares of a certain crip-toe (word filter is bs at times) and got worried, sold at a loss for 40 dollars but it was a very good lesson for me in terms of really figuring out what I'm doing and not being scared of drops.  
My current portfolio is:  
2.51 Shares of VOO  
1.05 Shares of SPY   
2.53 Shares of VTV   
\- These three are ETF's that I'm confident will go up long term, hence why instead of panic selling at a loss when I saw them dipping, I bought more, and made more profit.  
3.02 Shares of V   
\- As my one and only blue chip stock, I'm confident will be there for pretty much always. If anything happens to Visa and money, then there's more to worry about in the world than my shares of V going down.   
14.02 Shares of KO  
41.5 Shares of AGNC  
\- Here's where I'm kind of a bit wary. I know KO is a fine investment, and I bought these two for dividends. I trust in KO just like with V, and even though KO is down, I believe their price will raise back up once the pandemic is lifting. With a yield of about 3%, plus KO being a good investment without much growth, means I would at least have some form of stable dividends.  
\- 41.5 shares of AGNC might seem like a lot, but I also got it because it looked like it was heading towards growth, and paid out a very good dividend yield of around 7-8% currently  
I also plan on buying a few shares of a growth ETF to combo with my value ETF, and then one or two more blue chip companies to really get a feel for everything. I was down 40 bucks when I panic sold, but now I've nearly broken even within about a week, so I would consider that a very good comeback in all honesty.   
What do you think? As a new investor I'm trying to take as little risks as possible, which might sound odd because I'm a bit wary of AGNC, but to me they seemed like logical enough investments. I also am not sure if I want to try to ""snowball"" with dividends, or just go into growth stocks due to you already needing a lot of money to really get much out of dividends.",[],0

413,gz1b02i,2021-05-22,t1_gz163up,stocks,"That‚Äôs why I put emphasis on *some* people.

Similars attract. Those who are lovable themselves, because they have a beautiful inner makeup and in their nature to cherish and love the good (in both themselves and others), are spontaneously enthusiastic to see and express it with each other.

They are the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones.

While those who care too much for themselves to humbly appreciate and honor the good of others ‚Ä¶ well, they get the unloving company of their ilk.

Many don‚Äôt understand love.
For example, someone who believes loving means subjecting oneself to be another‚Äôs possession, he could easily complain that no one wants to ‚Äúlove‚Äù him/her.
Others think that the only loveable qualities are physical.

Love is too subtle to define with words, it‚Äôs exalting and intoxicating, uplifting and healing, and externally expresses itself in cherishing the beloved and their greatest good.

It‚Äôs full expression is rare even between friends and in married couples, because there is often an element of self interest stacked on it, a conditionality: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll want your best as long as you are good to me‚Äù, ‚Äúas long as you don‚Äôt become a more accomplished person than me‚Äù, or something similar.

VW has gone all in in electro because of pressure from politics. And now they can't do anything else than push it forward at any costs if they don't want to lose a big bunch of money and prestige.

The electro motors and the electro power train are not the problem, they are very efficient right now and still room for improvements. The biggest problem the electro has right now is the battery and the charging process either in effectivity as well as in infrastructure.

Additionally the ecological footprint of the electro cars from the very beginning to the end of life is not that lower compared to conventional cars.

All three technologies... combustion, Hydrogen and Electro have pros and cons right now and are more or less in the same cathegory if you see the big picture.

I can recognise that combustion is a bit on the top of its development, I don't really expect a real technological jump in it. But IMHO it still (at least right now) is better than the others in many ways.

If both alternative technologies (electro and hydrogen) would reach the relative development status that combustion has... I think that hydrogen would be better than electro. 

Sadly, I see too, that its current development status is still far from the maturity point of electro.

If I could decide for VW... I would not deprecate the combustion yet, I would get into electro right now and try to reach a top position in market share in it, but I would create an I+D division for hydrogen because it has more potential.

1. Do you guys really think, that the big energy players will sit and watch the game from the sideline? And yes, hydrogen is a loooong term solution, which will be profitable from 2030 on... Why? Because whole fkn Europe is supposed to get CO2 neutral by 2050 and the Nordic countries in Europe are constantly building their hydrogen infrastructure, to be the supplier for core countries like Germany and France. 

2. Hydrogen will eventually be profitable, our oil and gas infrastructure took trillions to build up and it would be great if we could use parts of it in future too. Ohh and btw, to all ppl who say that hydrogen is to expensive, yes, you're right, but look at the development in PV  and onshore wind market, it's now not only competitive to fossil fuels, but is outcompeting them. 
Ten years ago, nobody would have believe in that.

Netflix Original can mean multiple things: self-produced/co-produced content (like with Stranger Things still doesn't necessarily mean they own the IP) or licensed original programming that is exclusive to Netflix (though not necessarily worldwide).

It doesn't mean they also acquire the IP under the contract they signed with the production company/creators/IP owners even for co-produced content.

Case in point for some of the most popular shows on Netflix:

* Stranger Things is owned by the Duffer brothers (creators and exec producers of the series)
* Cobra Kai is owned by Sony Pictures
* The Crown is owned by Left Bank Pictures (Sony Pictures Television)
* Lucifer is owned by Warner Bros./DC Entertainment

Same thing for some of the older popular shows like House of Cards, Orange Is the New Black, Narcos. All owned by external production companies.

Netflix biggest advantage over the other streaming services is by far and away their brand.",[],0

Look at the 20 year or older chart on any stock or index. The hills and mountains go up sharply but gradual when we went from paper to computer (about 1994ish) which opened up the market to anyone with enough money and a computer. Gone were the days of calling your broker and driving to the bank. 

You can see when QE and the ‚ÄúFEDs printer goes brrr ‚Äú were added after 2008. You can see the affect of lowering the interest rates. 

All this additional money combined with recent low tax policies on corporations and individuals, extremely low interest rates, and you have the market climbing large mountains very easily. 

When we get to 2020 and COVID you see the fear drop but then with low tax business friendly policies, low inflation, additional stimulus money, additional printing & treasury buying, easy margin access because of low interest, retail investors jumping in with their cool new apps and stimulus checks, government interventions (EV and green energy money) added to the market and it looks like Mount Everest. Straight up. 

What happens when that goes away? Taxes are about to change and the Fed wants to stop adding. We are being told interest rates will go up and inflation needs to go up 2 or 3% in the way the Fed measures it. 

How many more stimulus checks do we think we are getting? What will finally pass in Congress regarding infrastructure? Do we think this has no limits? Even if the government withdraws help really slow? 

If you draw a trend line from 2000 to 2021 you can see the extreme nature of this pattern. 

So my question is how long do we trade sideways or will we go down the other side of this mountain? 

I can‚Äôt see the market going up like it has without all that help from the government and they are telling us they want off the mountain.

Interest rates are unhealthily low. An increase in rates would be healthy for the economy and would be healthy for equities after the sticker shock wore off.

Inflation concerns are nonsense. When rates increase to a healthy level it will be a non issue. Again, short term corrections are possible but long term we are looking at a period of strong healthy growth incoming.

We recovered from a deep dive this year. We didn't see unsustainable growth as much as we saw the whole market gap down and then spend the last year filling that gap back up.

In any case, if you are worried about a correction investing in index funds OBVIOUSLY is safer than individual stocks because of the inherent diversification. There are defensive funds that you can buy into as well such as consumer staples and value funds.

Maybe the market will pull back reflexively to some short term catalysts.

2015: -0.68%

2016: -2%

2017: +85%

2018: -0.84% (although in fairness, QQQ entered bear market territory that year and the other 2 of the big 3 flirted with it)

Virgin Galactic is not currently involved in space travel, not sure how many times that needs to be said lol. It's tourism, in the same way that cruise ships aimlessly wander around the oceans and coasts, and helicopter tours hover around arbitrary areas and then land back exactly where they started, accomplishing nothing (objectively speaking) yet charging extravagant amounts of money.

> there is no economic incentive to take people to space. It's an endless vacuum and hell scape, so far useful for nothing

Could you tell me what cruise ships and $50 million yachts are useful for? What about about luxury resort vacations, are those useful? To use your own example, how ""useful"" is flying a plane up to ~15,000 ft and then literally just jumping out of it? Certainly no economic incentive in any of those things (like the skydiving market which is *easily* over a billion dollar industry).

That is all not to mention that, on top of tourism, Virgin Galactic even has a potential business model to [literally as you put it] **""...get from point a to point b faster""**, however I'm not even arguing for that. As I said, those $250k tickets will become significantly lower in price and their demand will increase, that's how it works for every new product and service after all.

Refineries need an excuse to stay relevant if the oil money is to continue and as a result the only people who care are oil producers. Trust me bro, with enough energy storage and prolific renewables all gasses and combustible fuels turn into hobbyist-only materials.

Carbon neutral gas and fuels are coming, you think every house in Europe is going to suddenly switch out ever valve and mechanism to handle hydrogen explosive instead of methane??
