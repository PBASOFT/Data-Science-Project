193,2021-05-20,StockMarket,"  Tencent Holdings Ltd. reported a 25% gain in quarterly revenue as China’s largest company sustained a boom in gaming and cloud that began during the Covid-19 pandemic.  


Revenue climbed to 135.3 billion yuan ($21 billion) in the three months ended March, compared with the average 133.8 billion yuan of estimates. Net income came in at 47.8 billion yuan, versus 28.9 billion yuan a year earlier.  


The results affirmed the resilience of the world’s largest game publishing business as the pandemic recedes.    
For now, gaming and social content remain Tencent’s biggest and steadiest cash cows. It announced a pipeline of more than 40 new mobile and PC titles during its annual game showcase Sunday, including those adapted from familiar content like Japanese manga series One Piece and Digimon.",ngutqa,[],0

319,2021-05-18,StockMarket,"When I first heard about Forex trading around 2004, (this was before crypto trading existed) I was immediately intrigued and fascinated.  Every day, for what seems like endless hours, I caught myself daydreaming and thinking about the idea itself and wondering, “What does it really mean?” or “Does this shit really work?”  Let’s say in theory, a person gains some kind of skill or knowledge on how to outsmart the market and through this extraordinary skill, that person is then able to enter trades in what we are told is a global 6 trillion dollar liquid per day market (at that time it was 3 trillion) and be able to get profit from the trades.  Hopefully, the winning trades happen at least a higher percentage of time than the trades that don’t work out, right? And that’s reasonable to expect and doable by an average person, right?  (Ok.  Imagine going back in time to the point before you knew that almost know one ever achieves this and instead, enjoy the naivety and optimism you have for your newly discovered entrepreneurial project.)

Even a beginner can feel what it’s like to have a winning trade and that’s what gets us hooked on the addiction or in more positive terminology we could call it “motivation” or “passion” in Tony Robbins lingo. Yes, some would say it’s a delusional folly based on irrational exuberance. And if there is some special way to put the odds in your favor to have more winning than losing trades it seems like that would do the trick.  It seems like only a slight tweak or adjustment to most people’s trading strategies would activate the tipping point that puts them into the category of winning with consistent increase in capital.  I found plenty of reasons to be positive and optimistic about this project.  Later, I learned that some professionals had fewer winning trades than losing ones but the losing trades were really small and the winning trades were really big comparatively so it ends up creating a consistent increase in capital.  

Ok right.  I get it. But for me, I would prefer to actually know how to enter trades that win a high percentage of time in order to even feel like any increase would be legitimate.   I learned much later that even this belief is caused by unconscious core beliefs that limit success in trading but that’s a story for a later time. Still this desire for perfectionism, minimizing mistakes is part of what drove me to discover what works in trading. It has to be based on what I see is true about the market.  If I can see something is true and not base any trading strategy on something someone told me to do, then I know the probability is based on knowledge and skill and can be considered scientific to an extent. 

And then, the question arose, how much can a person make from trading?  This is a question that really enthralled me to the point of keeping me lying awake at night with wheels turning in my mind about how I would open my laptop for a few minutes at the beach, setting down my virgin margarita (limeade), and make a trade or two and seeing another $50,000 profit in my trading business, which of course, would be a simple easy and massively profitable enterprise. 

If the term “rude awakening” is appropriate for how to describe what actually happened later, that process was not a rude awakening of one day, it was drawn out over months and years of disappointment and struggle. But let’s not go there just yet because if this story leads to any discovery of a way to trade and actually get profit consistently, at least it has a happy ending and my sharing of ways to bypass the ridiculously excruciating trial and error that has happened along the way will be a way to really help a few people to not have to waste nearly as much time and money. 

The amount of wasted money on trading products like courses, software, and seminars has made me a bit of an activist on traders' consumer rights leading to expose some outright scams and deceptions that are so prevalent in the trading world especially in Forex and crypto. After a while, a person can spot the charlatons who have popped up in the Forex niche, people who have never traded successfully but are professional marketers who needed a “product” and were stumped about what to offer the “course junkies” and software addicts in this buying frenzied crowd of newbies as well as seasoned enthusiasts searching for some legitimate way to earn money from what is believed to be an honest skill like being a bricklayer, an architect, or chef. 

I have met many people who take up Forex trading in the hope of creating a part time side hustle income of something like an extra $1000 per month.  And let’s face it, most of us come from working class backgrounds and have a mindset of searching for some income that is enough to pay our living expenses. 

There is a HUGE problem with that idea.  If you believe you can earn consistent profit in trading and you intend to use that skill to make a thousand dollars and then AFTER you spend a few years gaining that skill, you use it by taking out your capital to make sure it never increases so that you limit yourself to ONLY getting $1000 per month, that would not make any sense.  If you ever do get this extraordinary skill you have gained the power to create an income of any amount and make as much wealth as you desire. Trading is not a side hustle.  If you master it you will become wealthy.  If you somehow force yourself to not allow your account to increase in any normal sensible way, it is possible to stop yourself from getting wealthy if you really want that. But that would be like owning a 5 star hotel but only allowing yourself to keep for yourself a receptionist’s salary. 

Not only would it never make sense for any trader who knows how to trade to use that skill to make one or two thousand dollars for paying bills, since we all unconsciously know that to be true it is the source of much of the inner conflicts that prevent traders from being able to trade.  If you don’t know by now, no matter what trading strategy you use and no matter how advanced your understanding of technical analysis is, the results that all traders get are mostly due to unconscious core beliefs.  If you’re not aware that’s true, try typing some keywords into Google and reading a book or two on personal development or psychology. Soon you will run into plenty of proof regarding that fact. 

Trading is not a hobby and not a part time side project.  If you master it, you are wealthy. Period. The unconscious limiting core beliefs that cause people to believe they can earn a couple of thousand dollars from trading and use it to pay their bills, keeps them from ever realizing any mastery in trading.  “Oh, but I don’t want to be one of those greedy rich people!”  This belief stops traders dead in their tracks from ever getting mastery of trading and because the conflict is *unconscious*, most will never know what the real problem is. 

**The Purpose or Intention of This Journey**

That’s what this story is about.  How to get to the bottom of whether there is a way to trade with a high enough probability and not fuck it up with psychological sabotage like suddenly feeling an anxiety attack that shuts off function of the frontal lobes of the brain while trying to remain calm and wise about trading decisions. And for the first step on this journey I have found that getting clear about your purpose for even going on this journey will help to form a clear map that you will create and/or discover for leading you to the goal of using your own knowledge and skill to earn consistent profit that will become any amount you can imagine.  If you succeed in mastering this skill, It’s just a matter of knowing how much time it will take for your account to increase to be the amount you want it to be. 

A valuable exercise to get you going is to get a notebook to use as a trading journal and another one to use as a personal development journal and write down your intention for what you hope to attain through learning to trade with excellence.  How will your life change when you have this skill you seek?  Will you use this skill to help others and participate in some form of philanthropy?  Do you have a mission that requires you to have this skill and this wealth that is for the benefit of others?  It’s ok if you just want to trade to get a dope car and impress girls, have sex and become a cocain addict for your mission. But chances are, if you begin to make contact with any part of yourself that has an intention to fulfill your real purpose, it might involve helping others in some way and maybe even doing something good for the world.  What's important is that before you do this you get clear about *why* you are doing it. People who give up in failure probably don’t know what their reason is for doing this in the first place. 

So to get started, take this step and be serious about it.  Write down why you want to learn to get profit consistently in trading and what you plan to do when that becomes a tangibly manifested reality of your life. No need to share anything on what you intend but being clear with yourself can help you to follow through with that intention.

Recently been watching AMC, due to the drama...and this morning I witness this ""action"" I have not seen before.  While things were quite flat, there was a sudden and instant jump in volume, but from 20 cents below the current trading price, back up to the current price, and then things continued as normal.

653,2021-05-20,StockMarket,"So basically what happened was that I originally had bought a few shares of etherium classic as my first stock. I saw it was plummeting and sold it at a loss for 40 bucks but I learned my lesson, plus figured 40 bucks was basically nothing to teach myself that lesson.

681,2021-05-20,StockMarket,"What Happened to the 3D Systems Stock Price Today?

3D printing leader 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) reported blowout first quarter numbers, and investors cheered the results by sending DDD stock up more than 15%.

•The blowout earnings report and subsequent stock price jump does little to “fix” what has been a broken stock for months now. From its early 2021 highs, DDD stock is still off more than 50%.

•We think recent weakness is a great buying opportunity, and that the big rebound in 3D printings stocks starts now.

-Why It Happened

•3D Systems’ first quarter earnings reports was stellar. In short, it was a huge double-beat quarter with accelerating revenue growth and improving margins.

•On the top-line, analysts were looking for essentially flat revenue growth, following just 2% revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. But revenues smashed estimated, and rose 8% year-over-year. On an organic basis ex certain business divestitures, revenues rose an impressive 17% year-over-year.

•The healthcare business is booming (up 36%). The industrial business is recovering with the economy (organic industrial sales were up 1%).

•On the bottom-line, 3D Systems smashed expectations by even more.

•Strong top-line performance and demand flowed through into stronger-than-expected pricing and healthy gross margins. Gross margins clocked in at 44%, up from 42% both a year ago and last quarter.

•Strong top-line performance also coupled with strict expense control to spark huge EBITDA margin expansion. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 13.2% in the quarter. A year ago, they were sitting at just 1.6%.

•Analysts were expecting just two cents for EPS on the bottom-line. 3D Systems reported a number nearly 9X that big at 17 cents.

•It was an amazing quarter. DDD stock surged in response.

-Does It Matter?

•This print matters in more ways than one.

For 3D Systems, it matters because it shows that this company is, indeed, on a rebounding growth trajectory that is causing meaningful improvements in revenues, margins, and profits. That’s a huge win for DDD stock.

For the broader 3D printing industry, it matters because it shows that all the hype in this space that emerged in late 2020 was not overstated. It was legit, as it is being backed up in early 2021 by very strong numbers. Growth in this space is unequivocally and rapidly accelerating, as 3D printing functionality goes up and costs come down, to a point where these machines are ready to redefine manufacturing everywhere.

That’s a huge win for other 3D printings stocks, like Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE).

-DDD Stock Price Forecast

We think 3D printings stocks are ready to rebound after a big lull over the past few months.

This rising tide will lift all boats, DDD stock included.

The consensus analyst price target on DDD stock is $28.

We see no reason why shares can’t or won’t rally toward that level over the next 12 months.

The once sleepy and left-for-dead 3D printing industry is ready to wake up and sprint into hypergrowth mode over the next decade.

For years, 3D printing was too slow, too expensive and too niche to be useful. Unless you consider small-scale, one-off prototyping as useful. The industry, though, has made huge technical advancements over the past several years. Today, 3D printers are printing faster than ever. This thanks to more efficient layer-by-layer printing technology. A byproduct of which is that they are becoming very affordable, as manufacturing processes have been streamlined, economics of scale has kicked in and material costs have plummeted. Most importantly, they are now able to print in metal (as opposed to just plastic), which makes them immediately usable on the factory floor.

The result is that more and more companies are incorporating rapid, cost-effective, metal 3D printing capabilities into their actual assembly lines. It’s the beginning of the long-overdue 3D Printing Revolution.

This industry is at a critical inflection point. It’s been a no-growth market for several years. Now, over the next few years, it’s going to transform into a sustainable 20%-plus growth market as a new generation of fast and affordable metal AM machines make their way onto factory floors everywhere, printing end-use parts for cars, planes, rocket-ships, medicine, and more.

We think these stocks could soar more than 10X in the coming years as they lead the world into a new of digital and on-demand manufacturing.

729,2021-05-20,StockMarket,"A Theory of Everything AMC: Wanda, AMC, the SEC, and Lawsuits

Disclaimer: Everything that is about to follow is speculation. It is purely a theory of mine based on known facts and common sense. Any dates included are to provide context. They do not indicate the beginning, middle, or end of the impending squeeze.

Disclaimer #2: I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice, I just really like this stock.

TL;DR- Wanda, AMC, and the SEC are working together to build a case against the major short sellers committing blatant fraud daily that is suppressing the price of AMC stock. Wanda and AMC will stand to make a lot of money in lawsuits for capital losses. Meanwhile, the SEC will be able to prosecute fraudulent entities using information shared by AMC.

The Players:

Wanda America Entertainment- Before February of 2021, Wanda had voting stake in AMC and was the single largest institutional shareholder of AMC. In early February 2021, Wanda converted class B common stock to class A common stock, which allowed them to sell shares on the open market. On March 19-20, 2021, Wanda sold 15.6 million shares of AMC stock, reducing their holdings from 8.8% of AMC common stock to 6.8% of AMC common stock. Pay attention to those dates

AMC Entertainment- Led by CEO Adam Aron, AMC has staved off bankruptcy during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have raised a total of 752 million dollars from direct offerings in 2021. That is in addition to the funds raised in december 2020. This influx of capital has put AMC into a position that they can maintain operation at current levels until the end of 2022, per their Q1 2021 earnings call. The first dilution of 2021 put an additional 63.3 million shares on the market. That was completed on January 27, 2021. The second dilution was the ATM offering program that completed the sale of 43 million shares from April 27 to May 12. Remember these dates too.

Securities and Exchange Commission- As the lead regulating agency for the stock market, the SEC is supposed to legislate, investigate, and prosecute any entity committing securities fraud. We vilify them, and rightfully so. They have taken a sideline seat and watched as we battled back from our own 1 yard line to be 1st and goal today. Their only interest in all of this is to mitigate the effect on our economy as a whole and to prosecute the offending parties. In order to do that they need evidence. Not just evidence of when and what (dates, naked shorting amount, illegal FTD resets, etc), but also the WHO. We all have our sights on Citadel, but they are not the only complicit player here. This is systemic and market-wide. AMC and GME are not the only securities affected by this, but that are the most public. They are also the ones that can provide information that the SEC desperately needs.

The Game:

Remember when I said to pay attention to the dates before? Well, lets dig into those.

January 27- This was D-day for the HFs. We had them cornered, a squeeze was imminent. Share price rocketed to over $20 a share, trading halts comprised most of the market hours, brokers weren't allowing people to buy, and Apes were throwing shit all over the walls with excitement. Marge was dialing. During all of this, at the peak of all peaks, with us getting ready to get out of the atmosphere, AMC announced the 63 million share dilution. The following day, AMC plummeted to the 10-14 range, and started its descent back down to $5 a share. Why would they do this now? It doesn't make sense until you read below.

March 18-20- On March 18th, AMC is on the rise. We are about to break a critical resistance level at $14.50. Intraday, we break that wall. We are all watching patiently to get our tendies out of the fryer. It feels like January 27th all over again. Then, March 19th comes and instead of going up, share price drops. Not as heavily as on the 27th, but it doesnt continue the upward trend. All of a sudden shares available to borrow goes from 0 to millions. Apes are confused. It doesn't make sense. We broke the wall. it's time to move. Maybe it's just the last breath of the HFs before they let it run and Marge calls. March 20th rolls around, and again, the share price drops. This time, we crash below the $12.50 support level. In the following days, we come back down to the 10-11 dollar range, where we sat until the end of April. We later found out through 13F filings that Wanda sold 15 million shares, stalling our ascent and bringing us back down to earth. Why would a company who stands to gain billions from a squeeze do this? It doesn't make sense until you read below.

End of April 2021- Once again, we are on the rise. Not quite to the $14.50 break point, but we are in a streak of green days, shares available to borrow are almost gone, and cost to borrow is skyrocketing when they are available. It feels like January and March again. We're getting ready to break 12.50 and gap up to the 14s again. Then, AMC announces its ATM offering program. Once again, from the 27th of april through the end of May, we drop back to the 10-11 dollar range. We found out at the Q1 earnings that during this period of descent, AMC had sold over 15 million shares onto the market, raising a significant amount of capital. Once again, we plummet back to earth. Why would a company sacrifice billions in profits off of the ATM offering to sell all of it's remaining sellable shares at 9.50-10.50 a share? It doesn't make sense until you read below.

Where are we at today- Once again, we are getting ready to break the resistance levels, and shares available to borrow are somehow appearing out of nowhere. Borrow rates have dropped 75 percent in a week, and every time we push that level of resistance, we get pulled back down. Does this sound familiar? I think Wanda is unloading another block of shares. This is horribly bad for us right? Can't be good? Wrong. This was always the plan, it was always the game. They're adding shorty rocket fuel. FOMO is kicking in. Retail is seeing a huge increase in liquidity as new buyers join in for liftoff. It is the perfect time to drop shares if you are intentionally delaying the squeeze. Those shares are gone almost immediately. Literally, if they sell at open, even the full 30 million would get eaten up in the first hour of trading. In order to figure out why they would delay the squeeze, we need to look at the playbook.

The Playbook:

AMC and Wanda's goal throughout these last 5 months has been to build a case for the mother of all legal claims against the entities short selling the stock with synthetic shares. Each time we reach a breaking point for the good, they are keeping the SP down as they gather the information they need to file a lawsuit. I graduated with a political science degree, with the aim of going to law school, so I have a decent amount of knowledge when it comes to legal proceedings. Having said that, this is what you need to prove damages in a civil lawsuit.

1.) Who- Who was the offending party that caused the damage?

2.) When- During what period or at what time did they cause you the damage?

3.) How- What did they do that caused you to incur damages?

4.) Damages incurred- You need to be able to define the amount of loss incurred due to the actions of the offending party. In this case, its a pecuniary damage (money lost).

The plays:

1.) Share count- In order to identify the who and the how, AMC needs to be able to prove which entities wronged them, and the amount of damage EACH of them caused. IE, how many shares did they short using malpractice? (naked shorting, FTD resets, etc) The share count does this for them. In order to disseminate voting materials, they need to know the information of who owns the shares of stock, how many they own, and have the contact information to send out voting materials. This gives them the who and the factor to multiply damages incurred per share against.

2.) Delay annual meeting- I firmly believe AMC delayed the meeting because of the sheer amount of shares they counted. The last thing a company wants to do is go into a critical vote with an inflated number of shares. In order to get anything on the ballot to pass, they need a majority of shareholders to approve. If the amount of shares and votes is inflated, they could potentially see all of their ballot items fail to pass.

3.) Involve the SEC- When they knew the who and amount of shares, I believe AMC got the SEC involved. They were able to provide concrete evidence to the SEC of the fraud that was ongoing since December. The SEC needed that information to file legal proceedings. Keep in mind, they need the same things AMC does, minus the damages incurred, to bring a case against the malpracticing firms. At this point, the SEC can actively watch the actions of the offending parties in real time. Building a case until the next share count. In addition, this gives AMC the ability to follow with a civil lawsuit using the SECs findings as the How of their claim. Here's the bonus, the SEC will be able to show AMC the how during the time of the 43 million dilution. These illegal activities were going on during a share dilution, directly affecting the share price AMC should have gotten for their shares sold.

4.) 2nd share recount- I think the SEC advised AMC to conduct another recount for a few reasons. 1.) the illegal activity ramped up from Janurary to April, and the actual share count would have undoubtedly increased in this period, and 2.) It allows the SEC to track another data point while getting ready for the market implosion this could cause. It also delays a notification to the public of just how broken the system is. Now, when AMC announces the share count, the SEC can announce the legal proceedings it will pursue, naming the defendants.

5.) Timing of dilutions- If AMC diluted during or after the squeeze, they wouldn't be able to correctly identify damages incurred and when they occurred. By having Wanda and AMC dilute when share price was not inflated, it gives a concrete timeframe of when they were damaged, as well as a count of shares that form the basis of the damage claim (15 million for Wanda, and 103 million for AMC).

4th and Goal (how it ends):

On June 2nd, AMC has to finish their share count so they can disseminate materials. Adam Aron has already stated he will make the share count public. When he announces the total shares counted, it will clearly show the blatant manipulation and illegal activities. Retail will FOMO, institutions will FOMO, and large private investors will FOMO. If you want confirmation that this was the end play, look for an announcement of a share recall, a formal investigation, or both with the announcement.

When they recall the shares, the MMs will need to get real shares, and only real shares, back from the HF before the date specified. This will ignite the margin calls and form the catalyst from the squeeze. The squeeze will be squoze, in theory. (Again, no dates, shhhh)

When the squeeze is over, AMC can now identify just how much they were damaged. They now have the who and when (share recount), the how (SEC investigation), and the damages incurred (delta between share price at market offering and top of the squeeze). A civil lawsuit will follow.

At any point after June 2nd, the SEC can announce the legal proceedings it will have and identify the offending parties. Here is the beauty, they can file for an immediate injunction to take control over the offending parties assets. In fact, this is common in legal proceedings involving malpractice. You have evidence the offending party is committing illegal acts, so you stop them from continuing them during legal proceedings.

Confirmation bias time: Why would Wanda and AMC sell shares pre-squeeze? Remember I said you would find out below? Well buckle up. Imagine the shares you have now, and knowing that you could get the maximum gains possible (the top of the top peak), for your shares. That is the position AMC and Wanda have put themselves into. it is honestly genius if you really think about it. They don't have to time the sales. Just watch it go, and when the dust settles, they can name their price from HISTORICAL FACT. I think we would all take this option.

763,2021-05-20,StockMarket," I've got two different charts I want to talk about today. For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Top Holdings By Country](https://preview.redd.it/t6on51qm6b071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0d48fa33b5a951b1d854e5fff550dd57e881211)

 Next, let's dig into the charts - 

 Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)** 

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/2ulk4qgp6b071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=f79e9ca6476503c77dd27224b219e7b65360fade)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

 Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day** 

*Processing img vh9rw2ws6b071...*

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

779,2021-05-20,StockMarket,"Since the last outlook the price of ZKIN has dropped by 2% as it's being traded for $4.34 per share.

On the hourly outlook we have spotted a falling wedge pattern which had bias to break to the upside. This pattern has broke to the upside yes, but the gains were pretty mediocre as they were capped at $4.60 per share.

The minor pivot resistance has been tested 4 times in a row with a series of unsuccessful tests which eventually led to a breakdown to good known support at $4.30.

The price action seems to be creating a rounded top pattern, which has bias to break to the downside, below $4.30.

Currently we are seeing that the price is testing the support at $4.30 and has created a new lower low, following the pivot low at $4.34 by a low at $4.30.

What are indicators suggesting, will the price recover or fall below $4.30?

A break below $4.30 will surely not be ideal as there is little support below it and could lead to some serious losses.

RSI has failed to break above 60 several this. This failed break above 60 is connected with price action being unable to break above $4.60.

MACD wave indicator is currently suggesting that a selling wave is present and the bearish volume is increasing.

Overall trend on this short time frame is a strong downtrend.

A break below $4.30 will lead to extended losses to $4.20.",nh6k9x,[],0

Let me start with I am one of the bottom 50 % of the population , but this time ,this bottom 50 % wil see your game plan and will get the rewards .

Lets start with fundamentals :

1- Our last days favorite subject : Somebodies call it beast , somebody says transitory , but I call it my best friend at least for nowadays ""INFLATION ""

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

In fact this is a reality that all of us encountering nowadays , but until now Fed always insist to use TRANSITORY .

In fact all we know this reality Because ınflation is something that you do not see . Inflation is something that you feel . I am sure all of us less or more were feeling in last days .

O HEADLINE FOR PEOPLE METAL OWNERS : FED ADMITTED THAT INFLATION MAY NOT BE TRANSITORY

Please don't blame especially people who hedge themselves because they are waiting 10 years this moment to come and what a wonderful to hear from :

Fed :""A number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and, if so, these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year.""

2. What was the real story of yesterday ? Why Fed admits and yields try to spike ;

Reverse repo usage just surpassed Covid crash highs. We are effectively out of repo market collateral, Fed is cornered, and there is no place to park $1TN more in reserves.

The market understood this harsh reality : Fed can't do 18 more months of QE;

So now I can say why I am one of the 50 % bottom that used above : Because this time I saw their game and will not loose again and here also try to share those datas to say to you open your eyes this the real game that Fed and Big 1 % are playing but all those 1 % know well the realities and they hedge themselves against Inflation and to the trillions of Usd free floating money .

And the expected question

when ınflation increase Fed increase the rates ?

So the game is over now 50 % hope understood the Fed and 1 % game to convince people for possible rate spikes but as said before this time 50 % saw theri game :

Yes, inflation expectations likely fell while nominal yields popped on hints of a [#QE](https://twitter.com/hashtag/QE?src=hashtag_click)

tape in the future. This is all just talk: inflation is rampant and the [#Fed](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fed?src=hashtag_click) can't raise rates or reduce [#QE](https://twitter.com/hashtag/QE?src=hashtag_click) significantly or for any length of time unless they want to collapse everything.

So position against all those ? where are the money ?

1- Metals : Gold , Silver , Platinium , Iron , Cobalt whatever shinny ( always keep in mind nowadays trend is green energy and choose more metals used all in those new energy )

2- Miners ( Mostly new green energy raw materials producers )

3- Inflation bonds

4- Oil futures but attention for possible Usa Iran deal and big oil amount can release to the market in a near future . Iran now is fully ready just wait usa green light to pump the oil .

5- Developing worlds bonds ( Turkey is my favorite nowadays their interest rate is 19 % which is amazing high and alrerady the currency collapsed 25 % so everything ready for flying ) Keep away from China because of possible unexpected policies .",nh7jes,[],0

Gold and silver have always managed to pass the test of time no matter the obstacle, this financial cycle / downturn is no different. If you want to protect your wealth or grow it while most things go red, consider either buying physical or a junior mining company like St. James Gold.

Before I get started, they have a fairly new telegram with interaction from their team itself so take a look if you want more than my opinion! [https://t.me/stjamesgold](https://t.me/stjamesgold) 

Just today St. James received their permit to begin both surface work and drilling at their new Quinn Lake Project over in Newfoundland. The project is adjacent and even contiguous with the Valentine Gold Project helmed by another company that recent discoveries indicated 3.14M OZ of gold at 1.36 g/t and another 1M OZ of gold at 1.7 g/t were inferred.

  
The company that owns a project beside theirs, has a market cap of over $500 million. St. James runs at a cool $74M, this is a great undervalued asset to own before the share price really takes off.   


This news is great for their Quinn project, but that's only one of three they own. They also own the Florin Gold Project in the Yukon, and the Grub Line Property also in Newfoundland. Both of these projects also have amazing prospects in their own rights. Most of these properties are 100% owned, so that will translate to 100% profit :)

While the company is pre-revenue, there is no long-term debt so there are no creditors that are owed before the shareholders.  
The 52-week range goes from 0.06 to 6.5, that's over 100x increase, incredible!! Just in the last 6 months the SP has gone from 0.15 to a current 4.7, that's more than 30x.

There was a recent dip that seems like a great place to get in before it starts soaring again. Future drilling permits and production till be in the near future so I wouldn't want to miss on this if I were you.

907,2021-05-20,StockMarket,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 20, 2021**

Stocks snapped their modest three-day losing streak and jumped higher today, with market participants encouraged by the Weekly Unemployment Report and inflationary fears tempering. As I said yesterday, I was encouraged to see volatility decreasing this week after the wild swing the market experienced recently and am even more encouraged by today’s movement that the sharp sell-off was overdone. 

The Department of Labor released their Weekly Unemployment Report, which showed 444,000 new jobless claims filed, a fresh pandemic low and marginally better than the 450,000 expected by economists. To put this into context, in April of last year, more than 6 million individuals filed jobless claims in one week. While the improvement in the labor market has been extremely encouraging, in the Federal Reserve’s April meeting minutes (basically notes about what was discussed in the meeting) noted “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals”.  

However, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Fed’s argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Fed’s view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be “transitory” and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also noted “a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about. [Read the entire meeting minutes here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210428.pdf)

In a video message this afternoon, Powell said the Federal Reserve plans to publish a paper this summer “outlining our current thinking” on digital payments and the tradeoffs of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). It is important to note this would not be based on blockchain like traditional cryptocurrencies and rather be a digital version of the dollar. Other banks that have signaled they are exploring CBDC’s are the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of China. The latter two are already testing digital forms of their currency. The Federal Reserve in Boston is working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to research technology that could be used to develop a CBDC and are expected to release their findings sometime in the Q3 of this year. 

Powell also said cryptos “may also carry potential risks to those users and to the broader financial system” and that “as technology advances, so must our attention to the appropriate regulatory and oversight framework. This includes paying attention to private-sector payment innovators who are currently not within the traditional regulatory arrangements applied to banks, investment firms, and other financial intermediaries.” He also added, “to date, cryptocurrencies have not served as a convenient way to make payments, given, among other factors, their swings in value.”

974,2021-05-20,StockMarket,"Market Status: Rally Attempt

The $SPY and $QQQ had a good rally today, with yesterday being a confirmation day for the $QQQ. With that said, it looks like buying strength is coming back into the market. Is this strength real or a false sense of hope?

As the market stands right now, it has not established a clear trajectory, so the answer is that nobody knows. If you are one on the riskier side, it never hurts to protect yourself with stop-losses immediately after buy orders trigger. The reality of the stock market is that it does what it wants and doesn't care about what you think it should do, so it is far more profitable to observe and act accordingly. 

A word from the wise, outweighing the possible risk of loss is better than being greedy.
