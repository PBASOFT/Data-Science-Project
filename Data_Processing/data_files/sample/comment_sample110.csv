If one completely ignored the **immediate** circumstances, I'd have to agree; the only thing currently suggesting investing is the future prospect that Ryan Cohen can pull off a turn around. (Which, to my mind, has a significant probability of success.)

But, you can't invest in isolation.  GME is heavily manipulated.  We know this.  ""Shorts have covered!""  We know the have not; merely shifted direct shorting into indirect means (ETFs/Options.)

What I think everyone who isn't a ""believer"" (no offense) misses is that we absolutely DO NOT believe in what you call ""a continued upward trend throughout the year.""  (Well, maybe some do, I don't.)  We believe in a ""blast off"" and reset to fundamentals.

We will sell for exorbitant amounts and by back in at sound levels (I'm thinking $38.50-45.00). Hell, my holdings literally just went completely positive (four separate lots) for the first time since early-March as I'm writing this.",['GME'],0

All the Apollo craft carried liquid oxygen in the Command and Service Module, used for both breathing and to power their electrical fuel cells. Now, zero-g does some weird stuff to fluid dynamics, and the pressure sensors in the tanks weren't always accurate as a result. To combat this, an internal mechanism was able to ""stir"" the O2 inside the tank, homogenizing/mixing it and allowing the pressure sensors to get a more accurate reading. The Apollo 13 crew performed a routine tank stir en route to the moon, but the CSM *Odyssey* had a fault in its wiring; some of the insulation on the wires that controlled the stirring mechanism had come off, leading to a short, leading to a spark, which reacted rather violently with the highly-pressurized pure O2 in the tanks. The explosion blew off essentially the entire panel on that side of the ship and ruptured both O2 tanks, causing the ship's atmosphere and electrical supply to be vented into space, along with causing extensive damage to numerous other systems onboard (their main antenna was utterly fucked, for instance). Luckily, the explosion hadn't ruptured the ship's hull, or they would have been dead right there. Knowing that they would need the command module for re-entry, the crew shut down the whole CSM to conserve power and moved to the Lunar Module *Aquarius*, using it as a lifeboat. The apes back at NASA had actually prepared contingency plans for this, even though the scenario had been considered ""extremely unlikely"", so they weren't going into things completely unprepared. It was uncomfortable - very, very uncomfortable - but the crew had enough food and oxygen to get them back to Earth. Water was a bit trickier; they had to ration roughly 200 mL (a bit under a cup, for any Americans reading this) per person per day, as most of their drinkable supply was produced as a byproduct from the CSM's fuel cells, which were now nonfunctional. 200 mL a day certainly isn't fun or pleasant, but it was doable. They could survive on it long enough to make it home. The next problem was carbon dioxide. 

The CO2 our bodies exhale isn't breathable, and in fact becomes toxic in high enough concentrations. This isn't a problem on Earth, both because we have an entire planets' worth of atmosphere to work with and because plants eat CO2 and shit oxygen (paraphrasing, of course). In an airtight, closed-loop environment like a spacecraft, however, it can build up to toxic levels within a matter of hours, and we thus use ""CO2 scrubbers"", small machines that use a chemical reaction to remove CO2 from the air and sequester it as a solid. *Aquarius* only had enough CO2 scrubbers to handle two people for ~45 hours, not 3 people for the 4-ish days it would take to return to Earth. It should also be noted that although the chemical reaction is ""free"" in terms of electricity, the scrubbers have to be properly fitted into their slots and have a fan running to pull atmosphere though, which takes a moderate amount of power. Just waving a spare canister around in the air wouldn't do anything, for instance. They still had a huge stock of fresh scrubber canisters left over in the *Odyssey* that hadn't been used, but with the *Odyssey* shut down, they couldn't use any of its systems. The obvious solution, then, was to use *Odyssey's* scrubber cartridges in *Aquarius'* systems, but - and I shit you not - the *Aquarus'* scrubbers accepted round cartridges, while the *Odyssey's* were square. The crew had to, quite literally, fit a square peg into a round hole. Yeah, the movie didn't make that up. Anyways, NASA put their enormously wrinkled brains to work and devised a contraption called ""the mailbox"". Using only what they had on board, the crew managed to create a device that allowed them to bridge the gap between the two systems, letting them hook up the CSM's scrubber cartridges to the Lunar Module's systems. It worked - CO2 levels in the cabin started dropping pretty much as soon as they hooked it up, and it held for the entire trip home. 

As an aside, something else interesting is that all the Apollo missions burned for the moon following something called a ""free-return trajectory"". This is essentially a carefully-balanced path that allows you to, if you don't fire your engine at all again after the initial burn, slingshot and loop back around the moon in a figure-eight motion to return to Earth, re-entering the atmosphere without any additional course corrections or adjustments, hence a ""free return"". This was considered a safe option, because if the CSM's engine failed to light for any course correction or lunar injection burns, the crew would still return to Earth safely as they followed the previous trajectory - you could say that NASA intentionally ""missed"" the moon with the initial trajectories of the Apollo craft. However, before the accident, *Odyssey* had performed her first midcourse correction burn, placing the craft into what was called a ""hybrid trajectory"". The ship would still miss the moon, but would also miss Earth on the return journey if no actions were taken. Had all gone well, this would have allowed the mission to land at their high-latitude target in the Fra Mauro highlands (a free-return trajectory would have limited landing spots to near-equatorial sites). All did not, of course, go well, and now the crew had to somehow make a correction burn if they wanted to actually come home instead of just waving out the window as they coasted by. 

Using the CSM *Odyssey's* engine was deemed fairly out of the question. In addition to lacking the power they'd need to reboot the CSM, run the guidance computers, run the engine, and shut everything back down again, they didn't have any information on its status, and were (rightly) concerned that the O2 tank explosion might have damaged it, in which case it could have just blown up the entire ship upon ignition. It was decided instead that they would perform several course correction burns using *Aquarius'* engine. The margins were slim, and they were operating far outside the Lunar Module's rated capabilities, but it ought to have been just capable of making the required course corrections. This required several NASA programmers on the ground to work around the clock, frantically figuring out how to program the *Aquarius'* flight computer for the task, as firing the lunar module's engine with the CSM still attached (let alone in an attempt to change the course of the spacecraft) had never been even remotely considered as a contingency. Mission Commander Jim Lovell also had to manually record values from *Odyssey's* flight computer before shutting down the CSM, re-calculating the values by hand according to the programmers' instructions on the ground before manually entering them into *Aquarius'* flight computer before each burn. Long story short, the burns were successful. They were more or less the most exciting part of the coast home; the rest of the crew's time reportedly consisted mostly of maintaining the spacecraft, conserving their energy, and otherwise trying to rest. By all accounts, it was absolutely miserable: everybody was exhausted, hungry, thirsty, freezing (with no power to continuously run the heater, temperatures dropped to as low as 3 Celsius within the cabin), and bored. Fred Haise, the Lunar Module pilot, also developed a UTI due to low fluid intake and microgravity's effects on the immune system. Eventually, though, they were nearing Earth, their trajectory was lined up, and it was time to enter the final phase of the flight.

The crew had to power up the CSM cold, from scratch, in-flight, a scenario that, once again, had never been even briefly thought about at NASA, as it had been thought so unlikely as to be impossible. Additionally, they had to do this without overstressing the cold batteries. If they drew too much current and killed them, the crew were all dead, as simple as that. Once again, NASA's remarkably wrinkled brains rose to the occasion, devising a procedure on the ground that the crew followed in-flight to power up the CSM once more. They cut the Command Module loose from the Service Module and *Aquarius*, photographing the side of the service module in the process. Reviewing the photos, it seems like an utter miracle that the crew weren't killed outright when the O2 tanks exploded - the entire side of the ship was torn open, and there was clear damage to *Odyssey's* engine, validating the decision to use *Aquarius* for their course correction burns. The crew prepared for re-entry. The heatshield had been below its rated temperature for days - it might have cracked or been damaged during the trip back. The crew was well aware of this, but there was no way for them to inspect it or to have done anything about it had it been damaged. Additionally, the craft was re-entering at a higher speed than it was designed for (Apollo 13 still holds the absolute world altitude record, obtained when they crossed the far side of the moon as it was at the farthest point in its orbit), far faster than any previous Apollo mission. There was a very real chance that the craft could have burned up like a shooting star, killing the crew instantly. Re-entering, the craft entered its expected plasma blackout, the sheath of particles shrouding the module preventing any communication with the crew. The ground crew clenched their teeth. The expected four-minute blackout period came and went, and still, there was no contact with the crew. Five minutes. Six. The ground crew was beginning to fear the worst. Suddenly, the radio crackled to life: *Odyssey* had made it, and was on track for a safe splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The efforts of thousands of NASA apes on the ground had been successful; the crew of Apollo 13 had been returned safely home.",[],0

I don't know how you people deal with the stress of using margin, etc. to over leverage yourself.  I guess the money I'm using is not money I can afford to lose.",['AMC'],0

2224,gzf9nms,2021-05-25,t1_gzeskb2,wallstreetbets,"I thought about housing versus crypto versus precious metals.

Housing has utility (you can use it) but no portability.  It is finite because of land area. Also demand outpaces supply because all the good spots are already filled with housing.  Housing is also a good proposition for skyrocketing inflation. If you have a mortgage, you can easily pay it off if inflation is soaring.  The problem with housing is that it can be fucked with by governments.  They can tax it into oblivion.  They know who owns it and can fuck with the owner.  They can pass laws protecting tenants and preventing evictions while the owner has no cash flow and can’t pay his mortgage and gets foreclosed on by his bank.  There is just all this fuckery that the government can pull on housing.

Precious metals have more portability and some utility (industrial applications)  They are not as finite as housing sense there is ongoing extraction.  But the ongoing mining is more and more expensive because all the good mines are mined so we’re left with having to mine in deeper and more dangerous mines.  Also, precious metals are not easily moved across borders.  Governments will also fuck with precious metals in times of crisis.  They may pass laws to fuck with ownership of precious metals.  Like asking owners to sell to the state. Or taxing ownership.  If it exists in the real world and is tangible/real, I expect that desperate governments will fuck with it.

Crypto/bitcoin is finite and the most portable.  It’s also borderless/international.  I don’t think one nations military or sovereign power would be able to stop or outlaw crypto.  It’s decentralized so there’s just no way to zap it out of existence.  It cannot be taxed, it can move across borders freely.  It also cannot be tracked by governments.  Ownership is anonymous.  I like it because desperate governments can’t fuck with it.",[],0

We've been in the same channel for 100yrs...just broke out to the top...the correction won't come until the Fed stops buying 
$120bn of bonds per month.  If the USA wants to hold onto reserve status, we can't devalue that USD forever.  So interest rates going to climb, valuations will go down.   How fast, how far, when that happens?   Henry Dean doesn't know.   Michael Burry doesn't know.

Every country on earth is devaluing during Covid...it's the only way the Fed gets away with it.  Eventually an economic winner of the Covid crisis emerges ..if it's China our pain will be the interest rate climb to stay relevent, and then the pain his the greater economy.  That doesn't start until the fed stops brrr...  

The setup we have today is the same as 1927-1929...if it plays out the same (which it probably won't) it could mean the same 90% off stock valuations and a 10yr depression to follow.  I believe history echoes, I don't believe anything was fixed from the 2008 crash, so yes I feel it will happen again.  Stock up  now...the party isn't over until the fed stop brr...don't play risky shit you can't lose, but don't miss out on the gains.  Then again this is WSB...fuck it YOLO apes!",[],0

>I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below, courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

>**What I'm saying my friends is that GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site.**

3) Hair in the mouth isn’t really as big of a deal as you might thing, but also yeah that can happen.

It’s not unhygienic, but if you ever feel that someone you’re having sex with is not clean, for whatever reason, there are plenty of ways to take care of that. You can always just suggest that you two take a shower with each other as foreplay, and that avoids any hurt feelings. Or you can just say no.

I did it in the 1960’s with Red Lake Labs.  Bought the float at $40, the broker naked shorted to sell to me, couldn’t borrow the stock to cover, and I sold it back to him the next day at $60.  All or none, Fill or Kill.  Legal, but he was unhappy.  There used to be an uptick rule: no short sale until after an uptick sale.  They should revive it, but they won’t.",[],0

The problem is a lot of the old school guys who were privileged enough to get this information are all dying out slowly. The way it works now is so over compartmentalized that no one really knows the full truth anymore, not like the old timers did.

Since we're just speculating here, I'd put my money into Northrup Grumman before anything else since they're pretty much the ones that got all that tech from the Roswell crash.  Philip Corso who was under Lt. Gen. Arthur Trudeau spoke about how the tech recovered paved the way for particle beams, fiber optics, lasers, integrated circuit, microprocessors, night vision and kevlar. 

There are only a handful of agencies/defense contractors that are involved in that stuff. Supposedly nothing even remotely interesting happens out at Area 51 anymore, all the good stuff was relocated out to Los Alamos and some other D.U.M.B's away from the eyes of everyone else. 

The government still believes that people aren't mentally capable of handling the truth that we're not alone in an infinitely vast universe. They think we're going to go into a panic like it's some Orwell radio show and we just can't process it.

6466,gzfj2ac,2021-05-25,t3_nkyn0w,wallstreetbets,"TIL: The IRS & Fed continue to treat creep-tow as a collectible, for tax purposes, as opposed to a capital asset. I believe that they may have done this to penalize or otherwise restrict one’s ability to trade such alternative currency token and recognize long term capital gains preferential tax treatment.  
However, the unintended consequence is that as a collectible, alternative currency tokens are NOT subject to the dreaded “Wash Sales” rule.  
Meaning, if you bought said token at high price and the price falls substantially, and you believe that the price could return to said high price, you can sell said token at the lower price, recognizing a loss on the sale of an asset, and then turn right around and repurchase said token at the same or similar price.  
That recognized loss could then be used, eventually, to offset any short-term capital gains, dollar-for-dollar.  
Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face, gives a new meaning to short-sightedness on the part of Uncle Sam.  I wonder if that was in their calculus when they determined to treat such assets as collectibles, as opposed to capital assets?",[],0

Probably wont get there, but sometimes you can profit even if it isn’t ITM, just due to the possibility. 

But again, options is mostly burning your money, for WSB plays I think shorting is the best, you do have to have an appetite for wide swings and wide stop losses, cause these things move wildy sometimes. Also I wouldn’t short GME, not because I think it isn’t a shit stock (it is), but because the price swings are so ridiculous it tends to blow up any sensible stop loss.

Your risk is never limited with any types of options, period. If you pay $100 premium for a naked call and it expires worthless you lose full $100

If you buy a call at $150 and sell a call at a higher strike for $50, your net debit is $100. If stock closes below both strikes then you lose full $100.

Now tell me how are you limiting the loss here by spread?

&#x200B;

>**I do my current average is around 60% per spread and these are just weekly ones**

You might get 60% average return weekly for a brief amount of time but it's not sustainable. I made 4000% on a week but I will not claim that I can do that in a consistent way for a long time. A 60% weekly return is basically

**(1.6)\^50 = 16,069,380,442% (considering there are 50 weeks of trading)**

That means if you invest $1 you will have 16 billion dollars by years end if you reinvest everything every week. Possible? NO.

Even if you do not reinvest the profit and use the same capital every week and withdraw all the profit, **that's still 3000% yearly return**. Again not possible.

I think the disclosure stuff has been happening because people that were inside of the government thought it was messed up that the tech wouldn't be shared to transform society and make things better.

I think the disclosure stuff has been happening because people that were inside of the government thought it was messed up that the tech wouldn't be shared to transform society and make things better. 

My guess is it's anti-gravity/magnetism paired with warp technology and powered by low energy nuclear reactions. Pretty sure our military and specifically the navy has been working on this tech for awhile. I saw some patent stuff that someone had posted at some point.

For the motivation of the short sellers, there's a lot of speculation about the future of the digital ad market with the coming privacy changes, but management seems to have a good handle on it. It blows my mind why retail investors get the idea that they know the digital ad market better than an entire management team running a billion dollar+ adtech company, but to each their own of course. Short sellers probably sold short due to IDFA changes in iOS, chrome cookie change, bloated valuation , and the lockup period expiration. The short borrow rate has been ticking higher though, so they are definitely being aggressive with their short sales. At the end of the day, what I see is a highly profitable company, growing at a nice rate, a strong management team, and a growth industry. Good long term hold in my book, but you are rolling the dice as even Google will admit that no one really knows what will happen when the third party cookie goes away.
