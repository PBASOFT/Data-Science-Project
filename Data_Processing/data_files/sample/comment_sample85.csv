is the movement we're seeing this week a Squeeze? Or a legit response to the reopening plans in the US which should see a legitimate drive to people returning to the theatre.

Either way, I think AMC overall is a good stock to invest in. at least the next year. Even if this is just a short squeeze, AMC SHOULD do very well once pandemic closures are over and we can watch movies in theatres again.

Even the novelty of it should drive revenues up and the stock price for the next few months while these opening plans resume.

Fifth time going to the well since February 25th, in four trips have netted 6,249.40 to the pot.  We'll see if I can buy 2 cover in a few days and make money.  Hints are that my broker is starting to play tricks again but so far no hard to borrow charges on GME.  Problem is AMC in the 20's makes sense if people start going back to theaters.  Many Wokesters see nothing wrong with Kowtowing to China as Cena did--he should do ALL his future pictures exclusively in Mandarin.

But GME at 235?  Ridiculous. In 2 years and 11 months it will be trading at 160 on its fundamentals alone!  But not 235--unless we have drastic inflation.  Ford Motor used to sell Roadsters at 295--several models in the mid-3-digits.  Price levels were different.

But for a meme stock like AMC I don't even know. Maybe a later expiration date?

4657,gzny281,2021-05-27,t1_gzmgqmr,wallstreetbets,"Mr. Rawlinson from Lucid pointed out something, which I agree with, that EV's are a technical ""arms race."" I said their business model will enable them to be far more profitable than any other automaker, not that they are currently.

Clearly if FSD works out, and frankly as an ""automaker"" they are the only one positioned I think to solve it (and I think in general compared to anyone else they are also better positioned here) the profits from that alone would dwarf any automaker's profits.

Besides that, their vertical integration, which they are well ahead of anyone else in that regard, from the manufacturing of parts that go into the car to selling cars direct means a more efficient pipeline and less places to share profits with.

On the battery front, they already are assumed to have the cheapest costs and with the 4680 batteries and the future development they laid out they may be headed to $50 per kWh, whereas others will be paying, perhaps double that amount for batteries.

Their build process is becoming more efficient and cheaper. For example converting the front and back to single casts eliminates 2/3rds (about 600 robots) of your body shop. That means less overhead costs, parts, and inherently a better car build.

Their battery efficiency, which will increase significantly with the 4680 cells and single casts, means less kWh's needed per car, which saves even more money.

I really did not want to get into details of this, rather my point was simply I think they will be more profitable, but from the above you can see some of my thought process here. I would think in every aspect listed above they are years ahead of any competitors. That translates into bigger than ordinary profits I think.

Beyond the above, their efforts in Energy storage and Solar Power should continue to see strong growth and as well that will translate into higher profits. EV's necessitate the need for home or grid energy storage and green energy production, so they both should see strong growth. Finally, we can get speculative, and wonder if they incorporate star link communications into their cars somehow to provide connectivity anyplace in the world. This is perhaps key to self-driving, especially if you are going to have cars driving in places where  the carriers have no service.",[],1

Now you know why I didn't short until this year--GME was just at ridiculous prices for now and demanded I sell short screeching its lungs out.

   BTW I do hate hedge funds because they are in fact Stock Market Pools and thus have been illegal since 1934.  Don't Tax Then--BUST 'EM!  Right now I lose only if I have to cover above 234 and I figure GME will go below that--its floor remember is 157: 550 million divided by 3.5 million shares.  It's a debt-free company with 300 million to spend making good with new managers that know how do that--it will just take them three years to get GME to sell at 160 on fundamentals which drive the technicals anyways.

But seeing as literally every single major firm and bank has similar, frequent violations in the last 12 years, it looks as though there is no need for collusion. It's just an unspoken rule they all know — purposely misreport your numbers to make a ton of money, and pay the miniscule fine to the company who takes 4 years to bring those violations to light anyways and buries them in boring legal jumbo.

That Tesla has laid out and is taking open concrete steps (e.g. their Texas factory that is being built is already producing single casts, likely for process and material testing right now) towards building cars that will be class leading for years to come is not relevant?

Agree, disagree, whatever. Just consider that every car company is trying to show their ""Tesla Killer"" without mentioning Tesla. They are terrified. Not sure why anyone would assume that Tesla is not a threat to the entire industry and decades of experience will win. Decades of experience building engines and transmissions are near worthless for EV's... Frankly the whole car (listen to Mr. Rawlinson from Lucid who mentions this) for an EV can be built differently, so not sure how important decades of experience building ICE vehicles helps in building EV's.

This table shows the interest rate that must be paid by a short seller of US:SOLO to the lender of that security. This fee is shown as an annual percentage rate (APR). Lenders are funds or individuals that own the security that have indicated to the broker that they are willing to lend it out. Dividends paid to a shorted security go to the owner/lender of the security, not to the borrower.

If you have a source to provide, then please do provide it, I'd love to see it. But just vaguely quoting ""the DD"" has about as much of an effect as quoting ""the Bible"" instead.

And yes, I'm well aware that FINRA takes years to finish investigating. That's why I'm just so curious about how you apparently know nothing changed about their behavior and that they're doing it now. It must be a hell of a source that you have. Too bad you still haven't shared it.
