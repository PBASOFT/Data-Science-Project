Few days ago bought some T puts worth only 30K and sold them next morning for 3.3 million.

In late January bought some far OTM GME calls with 30K for fun that turned into 27 million.

Bought SAVA calls and made 7.3 million

Bought TSLA calls the day before split announcement and turned 150K into 19 million. Same thing during S&P 500 inclusion except this time played big with 3 million that gave me a net profit of 228 million.

Hope you are going to be alright. 

Just to make a note for other apes and their future endeavors:

The stock of the company, CEO of which can end it with one tweet, is sitting near the all time high, like 4% off, and declining. It also gained something like 1,500% in just over a year to get there. The company had never made a profit before. The (trading) volume has been disappearing for months and, literally, the lowest it‚Äôs been in years. The guy goes ahead and buys calls with a strike ~6% out and break even price ~22% out. The guy sees a profit of ~15% in the next few days, but doesn‚Äôt take it. A week later the price starts to roll and volume actually picks up because people are selling. The guy holds hoping for a rebound. The due date is still ~6 months out, but the stock price keeps rolling for a month before it takes a breather. It does provide a couple of opportunities in the process to cut losses and get out of the trade, but the guy never takes it. About 2 months before expiry, the guy makes this post, down ~99%. The stock is down ~30% since the purchase and little hope for recovery.

Again, sorry for your loss, mate. I hope it runs in the time left and you recover some of the money.",[],0

I've worked customer service and multiple industries I'm going to tell you they're going to give you the circle jerk as much as I can until you decide to quit. So when dealing with customer service that is when you need the diamond hands. Don't give up keep pushing when you do that is when you get the answers. Sorry I don't have stock choices or advice because guess what I invest in stocks that I like personally companies that have values and things I like and other things that I invested in a long time ago are now doing good bad and the other. All I can say is do you love you and when you lose because the way you invested that's you it's no one else remember that but only invest what you can lose in cash Don't take margin ever. Never do it. I saw the one post about a kid taking his life because of what he chose to do. Don't do it Don't risk more than when you're willing to lose. At the end of the day your life matters more than a dollar. Money does not make you. And that's coming from someone who is addicted to money I love it it's a great thing. I am a gambleholic and I love money and itself. Stock market is not new to me been doing it since I don't know 20 something years ago. But I've learned to read what is going on in society and the specialists and stock markets and celebrities on a 1% scale because they drive things in certain ways but it's usually an up then a drastic down. This is very long if you actually have time to read it I give you a high five. But seriously if you're investing money be smart I think twice and be careful and get out before it drops.,[],0
1211,gz19dej,2021-05-22,t3_ni1fw5,wallstreetbets,"Attention All Apes, 

The time for action has come. 

If you‚Äôre tired of the hedge fund manipulation; if you‚Äôre angry about the malpractice of this stock; if you‚Äôre raging about the SEC‚Äôs inability to enforce the rules against these white collar criminals, then it‚Äôs time we stand in unison together. 

The hedgie scum are equipped, co-ordinated, and strategic in their efforts, and so must we to win this war. 

The MOASS is not guaranteed. Some will not make it back alive. But together we can storm the Citadel and bring the war to the enemy gates. 

Next week (W/C 24th May) will be a pivotal week for the Ape Army and to sustain interest in our objective. We need nothing less than diamond-handed elite special force Apes. 

I repeat: the squeeze is not guaranteed, but together we can wage a fair war. Gorillas in the mist, we shall cometh! 

The battle plan is simple: 

1. Apes between 18-25, buy what you can afford to lose on Monday 24th May;
2. Apes between 26-35, buy what you can afford to lose on Tuesday 25th May; 
3. Apes between 36-45, buy what you can afford to lose on Wednesday 26th May; 
4. Apes of 46+, buy what you can afford to lose on Thursday 27th May; 
5. All Apes, buy whatever remaining shares you can afford to lose on Friday 28th May.
6. HODL the damn line! 

We can only fight sustained co-ordinated hedgie attacks with a sustained co-ordinated Ape retaliation. Splinter cell Apes are exactly that: splintered and broken. 

If you‚Äôre with me, then let me hear it... Send word to your fellow Gorilla Gang. 

Together we are STRONG!

Your fellow Ape, 

Gen. HF Killa

I chased the guy who did it around in the dark outside, til he bounced off something and fell down.  I laughed at him and went back inside, got more drunk and left to hook up.

In the morning I went to meet up with the same group of friends for breakfast.  When I walked in they were calling me Dick Ripper.  Made no sense to me. 

My friend explained:

""Last night you tackled [Friend] into a grill and the side tray hit his dick and cut it halfway off.  He had to go get 7 stitches to put his weiner back on.  You just left and we had to call an ambulance.  He's still in the hospital.""

Stocks only go up


*This economic data looks grim,* I think to myself. *This is the right move.* I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 6/19 SPY 200p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.

I come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&P 500. 2700. Out of its bear market.

I hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. ""What am I-"" 

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he asks.

""Huh?"" I respond, confused.

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he demands, louder this time.

""I, uh... the coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's going to cause-"" **WHAM!** One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.

""It's priced in,"" he says coolly. ""So why did you short the domestic market?""

Dizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&P has climbed back to 2850. *Impossible*, I think to myself. ""Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 20 percent!"" I manage to answer. **WHAM!** Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.

""Repeat after me: stocks only go up,"" Powell demands.

I say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary *guh* escapes my mouth as it falls agape.

Powell frowns and continues, ""I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?""

I feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, ""GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-"" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.

""Stocks only go up,"" Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.

The first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.

""Stocks only go up,"" I say.",[],0

The idea is that a company sets up a central kitchen.  Then they deliver ""mostly"" cooked food to their distribution hubs around the city.  The kitchen itself can prepare any kind of food that is necessary.  Mexican, chinese, american, etc.  The central kitchen prepares it.  The hubs heat it up and do delivery.

- CEO pats himself on the back for ""saving the company"" by doing nothing and driving the company into the dirt for many years before covid, so badly that short interest was above 70%.  Hands out giant bonuses to himself on the dime of WSB

- issues more shares and promise not to sell them until more capital is needed, Adam Aron is just milking AMC dry and not trying to improve it

- unlike GME which has massive pivot potential, AMC execs took the money and ran while not vowing to change anything about what they were doing wrong that led their share price to crash and burn from its $30-$40 high

- one of their largest shareholders sees the writing on the wall and is sick of holding the bag, now is a perfect opportunity to jump ship at $12-14/share because it's clear to them AMCs heyday is over. 

Fuck Adam Aron, he got bailed out on good faith from the public and took the opportunity to line his fat pockets even more and beat AMC bloody for more cash.  I'm glad his largest shareholders are starting to abandon his awful ship too.  Unless someone that isn't a greedy slimy boomer takes over the company with a real vision for the future, it has no hope.","['GME', 'AMC']",0

Best thing about webull, you buy an options contract for the day, scalp it, sell it and the next day do it again. No PDT, just GFV, which means you can only do 1 trade a day with the cash you use.

Example: you have $100. You spend $50 on option, sell for $100, total is $150 but the $100 you made is T+1 so you can trade with that money again. You still have $50 cash available to trade for that day.

Hope that helps",[],0

If you expect to get your money back on the silver market-rate value  when you resell, you're going to have to wait a LONG time at current rates for your silver to rise to a resale value that will match what you paid .

Seriously dude - do you REALLY this bunch are buying and selling silver for you at ZERO PROFIT (like they **seem** to claim) .. They all work FREE ??. They don't get even PAID.. er .. so why do they BOTHER?   

really?

**On the other hand** if you a Post Apocalypse Survivalist and think fiat is going to become totally worthless, then you don't give a half-fuck HOW MUCH money you spend on a chunk of silver, right?  

But check it out, ask around, ya know?.. dollars might still be worth something in a few years? And you .. er .. ""might not"" be getting zero-charge market rate silver either. They make 10% of the silver value they send you just on  the postage, for starters.

Interest has to go up soon if you see the rise of prices in raw materials. Consumer goods will be affected by this and prices will keep rising.,[],0

Seriously, there are established patterns that stocks make (bull flag, bear flag, cup and handle etc) that can help. It can also be helpful to try to figure out the lower and higher resistance levels. This can help you figure out good buy in points or points where you should sell to mitigate loss (if you're a paper handed bitch of course). You can also look at volume, market cap, inflow and outflow of orders, look at the level 2 books to see bid and ask orders, and there's the various technical indicators like MACD, VWAP, RSI, etc which can help a bit too, but all any of this does is give you a more educated guess about how a stock will perform. If there was some formula that could accurately predict a stock's performance, we'd all be rich af. A time machine would also be very useful.

Me personally though, I just wake up before the market opens, do a line of coke off my own dick, take a slug of whiskey from the bottle I keep under my pillow, then buy large amounts of whatever this sub is recommending.

We often don‚Äôt listen to people speak; instead, we are thinking about what we are going to say while they are speaking. Don‚Äôt do this. Actually listen and pay attention; people can tell. Ask for more details when appropriate, as it often shows that you‚Äôre invested in whatever they are talking about. 

Don‚Äôt overshare. If you start talking about a topic and find your date isn‚Äôt interested, talk about something else. Do they show interest? Keep going. Let their reactions and emotions guide you. 

Give them time to speak, and focus on any mutual interests you have.

I know this all sounds very obvious, but most people don‚Äôt follow it. Also remember that dating is a numbers game. If you don‚Äôt get along, just move on. 

Also, while physical appearance is important, it‚Äôs not as important as you think. A good chunk of spouses didn‚Äôt find their partner physically attractive until a few dates in because attraction will grow with emotional attachment.

There were restrictions still in place on purchases going into Feb, and I had long exceeded the number of total shares you were allowed to have.  The whole debacle is what prompted me to cancel the transfer of additional funds into RH since I wasn't going to be able to use them to purchase more GME.  If they've since added customer support via phone, good for them, but that certainly wasn't an option to me back then or I would have jumped at the opportunity to resolve it much faster than it took, I had all my funds and shares locked up in RH with nary a repsonse, meanwhile was afraid to transfer out with the level of volatility we've seen with GME, and probably couldn't transfer out anyway with my whole account locked up.  I called every number I could find for RH on Google, including one that was apparently a cell belonging to a poor woman who had to field all these random RH customer calls.  I spam emailed them literally hundreds of times in chunks and over the course of weeks just to try and get them to respond. I take full responsibility for not researching the quality of a broker before doing business with them, that's on me.  But I never expected what happened would have occurred, and I certainly did not expect that a company would not offer any phone support for issues like mine.  I believe at the time the only support they had was for problems with options.  Oh well, lesson learned.  Don't believe me? That tells me that even if you've been a long time customer of RH's, you must never have encountered the type of problem I had or you'd know it was completely true.

Did you ever think that maybe it's a supply and demand issue and that the lie of a college degree is pushed by the same people? They push the idea that if you don't go to college you will be poor but it's actually the opposite. You are taught extremely left wing failed policies and to blame your failures on other's instead of teaching you how to succeed. Unless you are going to college in the STEM field you are wasting your money. They told this lie to my generation in the late 90's too. I decided that college was a waste of money for me personally and went out to make my own way. Years later I have more money than most of my peers that went with out the debt. If you actually learn how to manage your money and invest you can save tens of thousands of dollars or more by reading free books in a library.

The reason we have a lower standard of living is due to the Federal Reserve inflating the currency. Back when the boomers were growing up at least their money was tied to gold. Now everyone lives paycheck to paycheck and lives on debt. My grandparents generation actually had a thing called savings and didn't buy something unless they could pay cash. But now our currency inflates and everyone lives off credit cards.

This is a stupid question, but are there any active class action lawsuits against RH? I lost several hundred dollars last week between their glitchy UI and costumer service. They withdrew  1.2k from my checking account when they were supposed to take it from my RH balance. I bought shares before realizing what they had done and then they sold some of my positions without speaking to me in order to refund my checking account. I‚Äôve read similar stories online. 

Another time, they sold all of my position on one stock when I requested less than half of the shares to be sold. Their costumer service was very stern in this instance, basically saying I had no evidence. Now I screen record every transaction with them. 

I want out of RH but I don‚Äôt want to leave while I‚Äôm down. I‚Äôve been down since they openly conspired with Melvin and Citadel to shut down squeeze. 

There are other complaints I‚Äôve seen that seem to imply RH is operating beyond the boundaries of certain laws. 
 
I see posts about suing Citadel over the GME squeeze. It seems to me that RH is much more vulnerable than Citadel. As for me, I would just like to annihilate RH from my financial reality and the rest of the planet. Personally, I don‚Äôt like to be involved with lawsuits but I would certainly sign on to a class-action if it would A.) potentially bankrupt RH, B.) get me some of my money back w/o having to look at their stupid UI anymore.",['GME'],0

If fool believe that then sell so we can buy your position and in a year when it‚Äôs 5$ you can cry yourself to sleep. This game is a long game not a short game you can‚Äôt buy up crypto and expect to get Rich in a month or two. It‚Äôs going to take years to see the returns and it‚Äôs best to hold until atleast a year after purchase for lower tax rates especially with Biden in office. With Trump we would have double the crypto price right now it‚Äôs sickening but here we are we all maybe hodling well into Trumps 3rd Term (2)nd non stolen. The dems were slick and I give them that who would have known they would count ballots 7 days after an election ends but it‚Äôs in the past. I actually welcome a Biden admin and hope he does well and yea I Support Trump. Not for his mouth for his actions he is one you just have to ignore what he is saying. But Biden will do well after he gets out of his own way. Honestly I can‚Äôt believe how bad his admin is so far it‚Äôs truly sad it makes me sad and personally I think it goes to show how much we need Trump back. Without mail in ballots Trump wins in a landslide. I digress well played dems and enjoy what you voted for. He can‚Äôt even hold a press conference cause he will get in trouble I‚Äôve never in my life heard of that but ok the free worlds leader will get in trouble it‚Äôs more like if he talks he will get in trouble. Remember your not black if you vote for Trump that‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs words. Also what gets me is this man voted for all the laws that imprisoned blacks maybe blacks like pain must be masochistic. What dems really knew they were voting for was a dementia patient that is old as hell and they probably are going to poison him or something so cameltoe I mean Kamala heels up Harris can run our country into the dirt. So far so good I fully expect the legalization of attacking police next. Stay tuned!,[],1

+ You can sell the position (for a loss), then open up a spread further out in 2022. The spread for BUY 1000 CALL 1/21/22
and SELL 1005 CALL 1/21/22 was $.30 cents on Friday. You could get back some money as credit while you wait for this spread to ride out

7468,gz2havx,2021-05-22,t1_gz2ayqy,wallstreetbets,"There is a way you could get on top purposely losing money, but I think wash sales prevent this for now.

Say in 2020, I had $1.5m in three places - Google, Apple, Tesla, $500k each.

In 2021, Google is worth $600k, Apple is worth $600k and Tesla is worth $400k. I know that it's time to sell Google, and Tesla would probably go up in the future and this is just a temporary slump. If I sold Google and held Tesla and Apple, I pay taxes on $100k of realized gains.

However, if I sold Google and Tesla, and rebought Tesla immediately (or something like Tesla with the same temporary slump rationale), I effectively made $0 this year and pay no taxes because my $100k loss offsets $100k gains.

I can move the $600k from Google into another promising stock. Basically, I now have $600k to play around + $1m in securities = $1.6m, up $100k from last year, yet paid 0 taxes (maybe some trading fees).

Rinse and repeat for 5 years with different securities, and now I have a position worth $2m in the best stocks possible right now (not Google, Tesla and Apple) and I paid a grand total of $0 in taxes for these capital gains.

It is scalable, which means I could have a position of, say $5m, by the time I die, and I can pass that onto my kids who receive a basis step-up. Which means if they sold it, it acts as if they bought all of that at $5m, not my original $1.5m.

It's a brilliant way to build up your position, avoid a fuck ton of taxes, AND leave your kids a nice inheritance.","['AAPL', 'TSLA']",1

Last Mar 23, 2020 was lowest for Market, but still very few companies beat TQQQ (as given below) [https://imgur.com/xqssSfD](https://imgur.com/xqssSfD)

However, there is a major drop is coming within 45 days which may result 50% drop in TQQQ. Wise will remove Sell cash and wait for sidelines until you see TQQQ in blood bath!

That transports your whole team, compared to a speculative cost of $200,000 per person.  If you take into account that most private jets have the executives assistant and probably other senior executives and they leave on demand, suborbital is roughly 4x the cost per person.  Yes, there will be demand, but it will be very limited.

With limited demand, it's doubtful that regular routes would be run, thus it would likely be run as a charter.  With room for 6 passengers at a speculative cost of $100,000 per passenger (40% of today's cost which is a huge discount) it would be $1.2M return or 6x the cost of a private jet.  The posted numbers are 3 hours transatlantic which would net roughly 6 hours of time saved on a return trip.

I wonder why schools teach you that hyper is a 50% when I promise: at 49% you feel veeery hyperinflated. Even at 5% monthly you can see prices double at a minimun period of every year and half. Someone tell me if this is not to worry about.

According to the international bussiness standards, hiperinflation is defined by three requisites.  3% monthly makes you reach the cummulative 100% in three years. that is one of the requisites to be in a hyperinflated economy. 

Your country have an advantage: most of your printed money go around the world exporting inflation to other countries. You can verify it.
