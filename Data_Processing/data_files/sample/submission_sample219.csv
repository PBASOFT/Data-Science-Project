386,2021-05-21,stocks,"Oatly IPO happened yesterday. Market cap at close: ~ 12 billion USD. Pre-market it’s up 10%.

In comparison, Beyond Meat (BYND) currently sits at ~ 6,8 billion USD market cap.

Both have similar revenue. In 2020 Oatly’s revenue was 421,4 million USD. Beyond Meat’s 2020 revenue: 406,8 million USD. 

How does it makes sense that OTLY has almost double the market cap of BYND? Especially considering that Beyond Meat has a bit more specific (harder to replicate) product. It seems that many conpanies could produce plant milk if they wished so. 

Toughts? Another example of IPO valuation mania?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

493,2021-05-21,stocks,"I am a new investor and while I am learning more every day and looking into stuff more and more, Coca Cola has caught my eye. Basically, coca cola (I'll just say KO for now on) was shown to have a div/yield of around 3. On top of that, KO isn't going anywhere any time soon, and even though it's a gigantic thing, it's only at around 54 dollars per share. I'm thinking of buying a bit more shares of this than I normally would, around 19-20 or so, so I can get a decent amount of dividends and put those back into investing. Plus they pay out dividends very soon about next month, and quarterly at that. I have tried to play it as intelligently as I could, and if something may seem dumb, to me it made logical sense. I've mostly been investing in ETF's, with only Visa being my one blue collar company. I was wondering if it would be wise to then buy a few of KO as my next blue collar company, and buy more for the dividends aspect too. I do not want to invest in random stuff like the rip-toe currency stuff (can't say it because word filters are stupid), and I just want to be a long term investor. So again, as intelligently as I could think

My comparison, my portfolio right now is:  
2.51 shares of VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)  
3.02 shares of V (Visa)  
1.05 Shares of SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF)  
2.53 shares of VTV (Vanguard Value ETF)  
(I plan on buying a few shares of KO but here's where I come to ask if it's worth it to buy more, around 19-20 or just buy a few like I did with the others)

Thanks for the help and if you read this far, thanks for reading this far too. I've also noticed IRM for similar reasons, but I don't know much about IRM compared to Coca Cola.",nhpkn0,[],0
