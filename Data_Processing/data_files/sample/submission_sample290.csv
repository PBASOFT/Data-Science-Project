P/B is < 1 which means the stock is slightly undervalued compared to the company's book value. They have a high forward P/E. Institutional ownership is a whopping 51.3%, with big upticks in Q1 and Q2, which shows faith in the company from large, conservative investors. No real catalysts expected other than: they beat earnings, and haven't really had a good COVID recovery bump yet. Plus they have a decent dividend, and they're a real American company you can feel good about investing in. I think this is a good long term hold.

106,2021-05-22,pennystocks,"Hi folks,

I've been searching quite a lot about this ticker. People talk about it as if it was the next potential $TSNP. 

I do believe that I know which company will merge with GVSI : Road Runner Media Inc. **Why ?** 

Pretty basic, actually.

Look at the name of the two company officers (Richard Cutler and Randal Lanham). Randal also figure on the court paper for the custodianship.

**So what is road runner ?** 

« Road Runner Media, Inc. (RRM): A Technology company helping to resolve approximately 500,000 commercial vehicle accidents, resulting in over 5,000 mortalities in the USA annually. This is achieved through patented technology that enhances road and vehicle safety while accessing the existing $29 Billion Dollar Out Of Home (OOH) media market. RRM’s technology operates at the intersection of commercial vehicle fleets and Out Of Home Media, and consists of three (3) components: 1. A patented Vehicle Operational Indicator (VOI) is a rear-facing media display that operates in real-time as a “Digital Brake Light” (DBL), indicating when the vehicle operator brakes stops, selects turn signals, reverse and emergency flashers, enabling surrounding drivers to react accordingly. 2. The ability to display or integrate into Public Service Announcements (PSA) such as AMBER Alerts, and other federal and local government safety & emergency broadcast systems. 3. A proprietary Content Management System (CMS) enables real-time, local, and nationally targeted, messaging, and advertising to be transmitted to the display when the VOI and PSA are not being shown.» (Linkedin)

**They recently had partnership with Siemens technicians as it is stated in the picture above :** « We are excited to announce that [Road Runner Media, Inc.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/road-runner-media-inc/) will install our patented, rear-facing Digital Brake Light screens on 2,500 [Siemens](https://www.linkedin.com/company/siemens/) technicians vans across the U.S. The 46"" connected screens will enhance road safety and host brand advertising, giving marketers and agencies a new channel to reach consumer audiences on-the-move. » 

**They also had a debt financing recently of 60 millions :** 

« To pursue this idea, Lanham (who described himself as a “recovering attorney”) enlisted Chris Riley as CEO — Riley’s [experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisrriley/) includes several years as CEO of PepsiCo Australia and New Zealand. And the company announced this week that it has secured $62.5 million in debt financing from Baseline Growth Capital.

The idea of putting ads on moving vehicles isn’t new. There are, of course, ads on the tops of taxis, and [startups like Firefly](https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/firefly-strong-outdoor/) are also putting digital signage on top of Ubers and Lyfts. But Riley said Road Runner’s ruggedized, high-resolution LCD screens are very different, due to their size, quality and placement. »

For now, these are the infos that I found. I'm not quite sure what to think about it. I know that a lot of people are skeptical about this new way of adding adds to our driving systems. I am also sceptic about the financial aspect. I was in $GVSI but I sold all my position when I saw this. 

Currently, **GVSI is trading at 03 cents**, with a **market cap of 76 millions.** 

I'm really curious about what you guys think. Let me know !

1. For those aiming to purely make a quick and speculative play, skip to the ""Upcoming Catalysts and Timeline"" and ""TLDR"" section below.
2. \*Caveat. This is not financial advice nor am I liable for any of your investment decisions. I can literally bicep curl better than I write DD posts yet alone invest so please do so in your own terms.

# A. Preamble

$ONCT is one of the most underslept stocks in the biotech yet alone larger investing community, no question. Considering its solid clinical results and upcoming catalysts (literally in a few weeks), I don't see why it isn't getting the recognition it deserves.

ONCT is an early stage biotech specializing in targeting ROR1 expressing cancers. While cancer has always been a hot topic in this industry, ONCT is one of the *few* companies addressing it through the lens of ROR1. I'll explain more about ROR1 below but this isn't your run of the mill gene, protein, or whatever that other pharma companies are focusing on. VelosBio, another company focused on ROR1 cancers was acquired by Merck in 2020 for $2.8B ([https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/merck-inks-2-8b-velosbio-buyout-to-snag-anti-ror1-adc](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/merck-inks-2-8b-velosbio-buyout-to-snag-anti-ror1-adc)). The same for NBE-Therapeutics for $1.5B in 2020 by Boehringer Ingelheim ([https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/boehringer-inks-1-5b-nbe-buyout-joining-merck-ror1-adc-race](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/boehringer-inks-1-5b-nbe-buyout-joining-merck-ror1-adc-race)) . Looks like huge players in pharma are interested in ROR1 for some reason, and lucky for us, ONCT does *exactly* that.

# B. Cirmtuzumab for MCL and CLL (Blood Cancer)

https://preview.redd.it/jrh5iqzd67071.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=cad45ccd1668a57f107eaf0aeaf6c00bc786acda

A lot of things destroy cancer but those same things can also destroy our own healthy cells. **Cirmutzumab** is a potential first in class monoclonal antibody developed by ONCT and targets the ROR1 protein on the surface of cancer cells. ROR1 activity is associated with very **aggressive** symptoms ranging from metastasis to treatment resistance. Lucky for us, ROR1 is *highly* specific to a wide range of different cancers as seen in the figure below and is the very thing cirmtuzumab targets.

**Figure 1**. ROR1 Expression Across Different Tumors

https://preview.redd.it/v441lbhf67071.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa6e88427942443aea09ac3e48d5faf1e073de34

As seen in Figure 1, indications of interest are Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), both of which express ROR1 at extremely high levels. These are B-cell malignancies or hematologic cancers. Alright enough with the fluffy intros, **what does the data say?**

**Figure 2.** CIRLL Phase ½ Trial Data for MCL and CLL

https://preview.redd.it/ow3vwqhg67071.png?width=1514&format=png&auto=webp&s=665da36941ac844fa3247b756381ade612d94fb1

In a treatment design combining cirmtuzumab with ibrutinib, another treatment for hematologic malignancies, the **objective response rate** for MCL was **87%** and **92%** for CLL (Figure 2). So why was cirmtu incorporated with ibrutinib to begin with? Unfortunately, a large number of older patients develop resistance to ibrutinib and hematological disease like MCL can be extremely aggressive with a low 5-year survival rate ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7281539/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7281539/)). The combination not only exceeded the efficacy of standalone ibrutinib therapy for MCL with a historical ORR of around 65% but also did so in high-risk populations that were **heavily pre-treated with other therapies**. The data is non-negotiable (Figure 3).

**Figure 3**. Overview of Results in Sub-Populations. CR stands for complete response while PR stands for partial response.

https://preview.redd.it/6duwxg9h67071.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=f28331fe2273759d751b460cb710b582f0855c0b

Like I said before, a lot of things can attack cancer albeit at the expense of our own cells. Safety is all the more important for cancer and older patients with potentially compromised immune function. There were **0 discontinuations or dose limiting toxicities from cirmtuzumab**. So we potentially have a promising new therapy that targets a range of cancers effectively while minimizing treatment side-effects. Sounds like a solid win to me.

As a side note, ONCT recently expanded their indications to other cancers such as breast cancer. In a trial conducted in UC San Diego, patients with HER2 negative metastatic or locally advanced unresectable breast cancer were treated with cirmtuzumab + paclitaxel. This is an **extremely aggressive form of breast cancer** with patients receiving a **median of 6 prior therapies**. The study reported an objective response rate of around 57% which beats the historical rate at around 30% for this subgroup of patients. I will admit, the share price took a hit after this announcement. I venture to say this was a combination of people selling the news and people feeling discouraged with the seemingly low response rate of 57% without realizing that these patients were being treated for **aggressive and treatment resistance breast cancer**.

ONCT is also in dialogue with the **FDA for a potential accelerated approval study for MCL.** Now, clinical trials can last years so will we have patent protection once this therapy is approved? Yup, **patent protection extending all the way to 2033**.

# C. TK216 for Ewing Sarcoma

https://preview.redd.it/pxd7rhai67071.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fa1075705c3a7ab94fac97e2dfc3ca4cfae0105

To pivot, ONCT is also developing a treatment called **TK216** for Ewing Sarcoma. Ewing sarcoma is a very rare pediatric cancer and the 2nd most common pediatric bone cancer. The current standard of care is absolutely abysmal and is based on chemotherapy and invasive surgical procedures. I seriously can't stress how pitiful current treatments are for this disease.

TK216 targets a family of proteins called ETS factors that are directly implicated in Ewing sarcoma and other cancers. So what does the data say about TK216? Well, in a phase ½ trial conducted on patients with relapsed Ewing sarcoma and who received on average **4 prior therapies**, TK216 accomplished a **9% complete response rate** and **43% disease control rate**. Looks crappy right? Until you dig around and look at the response rates of approved therapies for this disease, you won't realize how **phenomenal** these results are. The FDA seems to agree and has assigned TK216 with an **orphan drug designation for Ewing Sarcoma**.

**Figure 4**. TK216 Clinical Response Rate in Relapsed or Refractory Ewing Sarcoma

https://preview.redd.it/ibaa2klj67071.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=52b0601afed2f424f774e83ce15c5bb52e834186

# D. *** Upcoming Catalysts

Here's a brief overview on the expected milestones and timeline

https://preview.redd.it/946b3zik67071.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=f353cf54506b071c6bb20e24598f58d298312d44

**Most importantly** **and the reason why I'm writing this post right now**, ONCT will be presenting its most updated results for cirmtuzumab on MCL and CLL patients and TK216 on Ewing sarcoma in the **2021 ASCO Conference on June 4th and 7th**. This is **highly anticipated data** in what is the world's leading cancer conference, and I expect a huge run up to the conference. Just for reference, ONCT experienced a 78.1% surge in price after releasing an update on its phase ½ trial for cirmtuzumab back in November of 2020. Moreover, the embargoed abstracts for these results were released **today**.

# E. May 19th Data Updates

On May 19th, ONCT released its embargoed abstracts containing the most recent updates concerning cirmtuzumab and TK216. I'd encourage you to look into the updated data yourself:

1. Cirmtuzumab ([https://investor.oncternal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oncternal-therapeutics-presents-updated-interim-data-cirmtuzumab](https://investor.oncternal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oncternal-therapeutics-presents-updated-interim-data-cirmtuzumab)).
2. TK216 ([https://investor.oncternal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oncternal-therapeutics-presents-updated-interim-data-tk216](https://investor.oncternal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oncternal-therapeutics-presents-updated-interim-data-tk216)).

While the details of each trial will be discussed at the conference, I want to mention some key results.

**Cirmtuzumab for MCL May 19th Update**:

1. Objective response rate of **83%** in **heavily pre-treated patients with MCL, beating the historical ORR of 66%.**
2. Complete response rate of **39% for MCL, beating the historical CR rate of 20%.**
3. Median progression-free survival and overall survival **not reached.**
4. **Excellent safety profile** with slight improvements compared to historical treatment with ibrutinib.

**Cirmtuzumab for CLL May 19th Update:**

1. Objective response rate of **94%** in **heavily pre-treated patients with CLL.**
2. Median progression-free survival and overall survival **not reached.**
3. **Excellent safety profile** with slight improvements compared to historical treatment with ibrutinib.

**TK216 for Ewing Sarcoma May 19th Update:**

1. **2 patients with complete response** with a follow up of over 1 year each.
2. Stable disease reached for **35.5%** of patients.
3. Updated safety profile showing that TK216 was well-tolerated with no unexpected off-target toxicities or deaths.
4. Patients had **metastases at study entry and heavily pre-treated with a median # of 3 prior systemic therapies**

I wanted to spend more time writing a thorough DD highlighting additional factors such as the management team, details on market potential, expansion into CAR-T therapy, etc. but I wanted to at least post something up before the expected run up to the ASCO conference. If you are interested, I will be happy to write a part II and follow up to this post.

TLDR

1. Promising data on hematological cancers and Ewing sarcoma to be released in **June 4th and 7th,** making this a possible short-term play. Historically, large surges in price with each data release.
2. Embargoed abstracts for #1 released today with excellent data.",ngpzbi,[],0

The company issued an offering recently which led its stock to drop from 10$ a share down to about 3$ where it bottomed out.

Since then the daily chart has been curling up, it has been very bearish up until this point. All of the indicators are very extended, bottomed out and converging on bullish. As of three days ago green volume has started coming in more and more. Currently as of Friday sitting at 2x average volume.
AEI has a low float of 6m, and currently receiving higher than average volume as it curls back up. Its sitting at 4.21$ after hours, but on the 30min chart it is very extended and I would expect a pullback to the 4$ mark and hold that as new support. If it hold 4$ there isn't anything stopping it to 6$. Especially if it receives more volume, with a 6m float, this stock could go crazy and I want to be in it if and when it does!

RSI, MACD, and Stochastics and Volume all indicate a nice run up in the very near future and I will absolutely watch to size into a position around the 4$ mark.",niq76u,[],0
