second, he could very well be correct that TSLA is overvalued... it went up 700% in a single year, doesnt take a genius to know its overvalued. Burry shorted TSLA last year, didnt go well for him.

the key difference between the average retail investor and him though, is he is playing with other people's money. he can afford to wait YEARS. he still get paid millions managing the fund even if it loses money during all those years. Haven't watched that movie? he literally had power to lock up his clients funds when it was bleeding out of money. it wasnt his money, he could be as selfish as he wanted. so the question is, can you do the same? do you have the power to wait for years for a potentially wrong bet? that if the bets go wrong, very wrong, you still end up making money?

Ah, the mandatory ""new paradigm"" post. A sure sign we are at the height of the bubble. Solid companies such as MSFT and Google will be fine of course. The vast majority of the newish trendy ones that came into being during the cheap money period of the last decade are probably doomed. 

Also the term ""tech"" has pretty much lost all meaning now. When people say ""Tech"" nowadays they always mean the rising of the IT field and computer technology during the last 30 years. The problem here is that this type of ""Tech"" is not the future, it's already the present and has been for awhile. It's ubiquitous. Everyone owns a smartphone and a computer today. A bicycle was once a cutting-edge tech too once, now it's just a mundane item. Same with the automobile and the airplane. Every new ""tech"" has a growth phase and then it reaches a plateau or declines eventually. ""IT tech"" has been growing for over 30 years, its cool growth phase is probably coming to an end sooner rather than later.. I mean when everyone owns a smartphone already how are you going to sell more? If everyone uses google already every day, how are you going to sell more ads?

second, he could very well be correct that TSLA is overvalued... it went up 700% in a single year, doesnt take a genius to know its overvalued. Burry shorted TSLA last year, didnt go well for him.

the key difference between the average retail investor and him though, is he is playing with other people's money. he can afford to wait YEARS. he still get paid millions managing the fund even if it loses money during all those years. Haven't watched that movie? he literally had power to lock up his clients funds when it was bleeding out of money. it wasnt his money, he could be as selfish as he wanted. so the question is, can you do the same? do you have the power to wait for years for a potentially wrong bet? that if the bets go wrong, very wrong, you still end up making money?

Ah, the mandatory ""new paradigm"" post. A sure sign we are at the height of the bubble. Solid companies such as MSFT and Google will be fine of course. The vast majority of the newish trendy ones that came into being during the cheap money period of the last decade are probably doomed. 

Also the term ""tech"" has pretty much lost all meaning now. When people say ""Tech"" nowadays they always mean the rising of the IT field and computer technology during the last 30 years. The problem here is that this type of ""Tech"" is not the future, it's already the present and has been for awhile. It's ubiquitous. Everyone owns a smartphone and a computer today. A bicycle was once a cutting-edge tech too once, now it's just a mundane item. Same with the automobile and the airplane. Every new ""tech"" has a growth phase and then it reaches a plateau or declines eventually. ""IT tech"" has been growing for over 30 years, its cool growth phase is probably coming to an end sooner rather than later.. I mean when everyone owns a smartphone already how are you going to sell more? If everyone uses google already every day, how are you going to sell more ads?

With the influx of new retail investors who were, with all respect to them, naive and looking for fast payoffs, a lot of them turned to SPACs, thinking they'd all pop off. Chamath did a great job at selling to this crowd.

Early investors like Chamath get the advantage because they get significant portions of the company for way cheaper than IPO. As he became the ""SPAC guy,"" investors took anything he offered and ran it up, without even knowing the companies attached to them. And then he sold for profit and left the underlying to rot.

Most of this became obvious when he publicly announced that he'd never sell SPCE, and then dumped his positions about a month later, after making himself a nice profit. SPCE, of course, is a bad company at best, and a NKLA at worst. He has similar motives with the rest of his companies as well.

I have no issue with people making money on the market, that's the whole point, but it left a bad taste in my mouth that he brands himself as a friend to the retail investor, but sells them a bunch of low quality junk and uses them as liquidity to get out himself.",gyk6eku,t1_gyjqss6,['SPCE'],1

659,2021-05-18,StockMarket,"It will go exactly the same way it did the last time - the big and leading investor will turn 100k+ into millions and the little retail ones will pay for it. The following is a warning to the people that just blindly follow. You can definitely gamble and win, but at least be reasonable enough what you enter.

The main difference is to have the same effect as it had last time you'd need to reach the same short interest with the same 15 times leverage and not to forget your starting point is now not 10-20$ but 167$. 

Let's assume they are stupid enough to actually leverage their short positions still as strong with 15 times (which is insanely unlikely after many got burned, though even more hedgies made a ton of money on it), the positions are this time way smaller (makes sense, you can buy way more positions on 10$ than you can on 167$). Let's keep it simple and just say that the position is now 15 times smaller in amount of shares, but same in value (it would be 16.7 times, but as I said, simple).

We will also assume the main short positions were previously at 20$, which is really generous considering the year started at 17$ and it went down to \~7$ in it's history. To understand why this is really important you have to take about margin requirements, interest and leverage, but again I'll keep it simple because all of these things would make it worse for the retail investor to cause a second squeeze. If you didn't realize it already, everything I put together so far is put into high favor of the retail investor, meaning if the following sounds unlikely or even impossible to happen, then just imagine how unlikely it actually is without a favor.

The main squeeze happened previously assumed at 350$ and 150$, at both cases a massive volume went into GME while buying was restricted on most retail brokers. In the first case it reached 500$, in the second case it reached back to 350$. The 150 to 350 jump was by far more significant and most likely the majority of the squeeze. That means the squeeze was achieved with a difference of 150-20=130$. To achieve the same effect on 167$ starting position you would need to reach 297$. This sounds very achievable, doesn't it? Except that the 297$ assumes the same amount is shorted than it was on 20$, which obviously isn't the case. While the same amount of money could have went in, the positions are way less, meaning the losses are way less. So let's go back to get 15 times smaller positions I mentioned before. Just in case someone can't follow:

If you short Gamestop for 1000$ at a share price of 20$, you have 50 open positions. If the price now goes to 40$, then your positions are at -20$, per position. That means you are down 1000$ as a hedge fund. Now we amplify this by the 15 leverage that was reported on these positions and those 50 positions are now a loss of -15,000$. Sounds small but don't forget I only used 50 open positions (as in, 50 shorted shares), while reality was way beyond millions. What you should actually look at that their position of 1000$ now lost them 15,000$, and that while the share price was only at 40$. For 150$ that's a loss of 130$ per share, or 50x130=6500, times 15 for the leverage, is 97,500$ in losses. On only 50 shorted shares. And not to forget, these have interest to a certain extend (usually big accounts pay way less interest or even no interest if they don't require margin to hold up the position).

Now that we talked about what happened we have to talk about what needs to happen here for the same effect. We will use the same example to make it clear for everyone, but instead of using 20$ as a share price it's now 167$ and the same 1000$ used. When you open a short position now worth 1000$ in total, that's only 6 open positions. That's it. Not like the 50 before. While the same money is used, it costs now way more. But if the same money is used, does this matter? Let's play it through. In the first example above this we went from 20$ to 40$, so let's go up 20$ now. We reach 187$, a loss of 20$ per share. 6x20=120, 15 times leverage = 1,800$. That's it. Before we had a loss of -15,000$, now it would only be a loss of 1,800$. That means to reach the same level we had before, you have to adjust for the difference in amount, so let's do that. We can't force them to buy more, so all you can do is aim for a higher stock price that the loss for the 1000$ investment in both examples is the same. Oh and of course that's not for the case of a 20$ difference, at 40$ nothing happened. What we care about is the 150$ (which is again in favor of the investor the lowest point possible to compare with, a real point would rather be 300-350$ which would make it way more impossible to achieve).

If you couldn't follow, our goal is to calculate what cost the share price has to reach that the 6 positions at 167$ have an impact as strong as the 50 positions at 20$. This on it's own means nothing, but once you get to that territory there is a high chance history repeats, unless they learned and improved their strategy.

Let's add together what we know:

\-We need to reach a price of 297$ to be in the same price difference as previously

\-Since way less shares were shorted now, we have to make up to reach the same loss by increasing the share price, since we can't force them to use more capital to open more positions

We take the 6500$ in losses we had in the first example pre-leverage (since we care about the stock price) and now divide it by 6, the new amount of positions we were able to open at a price of 167. That comes down to 1083.33$ you have to reach as a LOSS, not share price. For the share price we have to add the 167 cost on top since that's the starting point, so 1250$. 

If you didn't follow this, here is the TL&DR explanation: For a hedge fund to see the same amount of losses, assuming the position size is the same but quantity is less due to way higher price, the stock GME would need to reach a price of 1250$. 

There are many factors that have to be considered here:

1: While there is a world that exactly the same mistakes were done, it's very unlikely

2: They already played dirty the last time, if it would get to the point again that will repeat but way worse, probably also with way less media coverage because they learned their lessons to get better at playing their own game

3: The 1250$ is a real low role. The main reason for that is that the assumption is the same investment, but after some hedge funds got burned badly there is a high chance new short positions are way smaller. My entire example was with the same amount of money used, but that's very unlikely.

4: The main reason the squeeze was so succesfull was the 15 times leverage used, amplifying everything by a shit ton. Yet again I would be highly surprised if they did the same amount again. Even just a reduction from 15 times to 10 times means you have to reach a 33% higher share price, which is a ton considering my for the retail investor highly favored calculation is already at 1250$.

5: Since this is a repeat and not a new thing, strategies were most likely adjusted. There is a high chance that shorting is followed by buying, meaning this can easily turn into a win-win for them. They can sell high after a certain subreddit hypes it up like crazy, and then sell at a small lose when it comes back down again. Just as a reminder, the last time it went down to it's 30s. 

So yep, good luck everyone who is involved.",gykz700,t3_nekqvi,['GME'],0

The most obvious is to split each group up by skill level.

In order to be comparing ""apples to apples"" ... the skill level of the groups has to be the same!  


Time frame is also a critical factor.

Comparing active trading to holding long term ... long term MAY be the winner ... in the LONG term.  However, in the short term, the result will depend more on the market!  

It really boils down to having the skills & tools to do short term trading.  Then working very  hard to make it work.  Day starts between 4 and 6 AM ... so you are ready for the opening bell.  A break will come if you are lucky.  But back at it no later than 2 PM until after the closing bell.

921,2021-05-18,StockMarket,"II. Naked Short Selling   
A. Background   
Many issuers and investors have   
complained about alleged ‚Äò‚Äònaked short   
selling,‚Äô‚Äô especially in thinly-capitalized   
securities trading over-the-counter.

27 Naked short selling is selling short   
without borrowing the necessary   
securities to make delivery, thus   
potentially resulting in a ‚Äò‚Äòfail to   
deliver‚Äô‚Äô securities to the buyer.  
Naked short selling can have a   
number of negative effects on the   
market, particularly when the fails to   
deliver persist for an extended period of   
time and result in a significantly large   
unfulfilled delivery obligation at the   
clearing agency where trades are   
settled.

28 At times, the amount of fails   
to deliver may be greater than the total   
public float. In effect the naked short   
seller unilaterally converts a securities   
contract **(which should settle in three**   
**days after the trade date)** into an   
undated futures-type contract, which   
the buyer might not have agreed to or   
that would have been priced differently.   
The seller‚Äôs failure to deliver securities   
may also adversely affect certain rights   
of the buyer, such as the right to vote.   
More significantly, naked short sellers   
enjoy greater leverage than if they were   
required to borrow securities and   
deliver within a reasonable time period,   
and they may use this additional   
leverage to engage in trading activities   
that deliberately depress the price of a   
security.

29 The Commission recently brought an   
enforcement action against certain   
parties, alleging manipulative naked   
short selling, in a scheme sometimes

termed as a ‚Äò‚Äòdeath spiral.‚Äô‚Äô These   
schemes generally involve parties   
arranging financings in public   
companies that are unable to obtain   
more conventional financing in the   
capital markets due to their precarious   
financial condition. The party providing   
financing receives from a public   
company debentures that are later   
convertible into the stock of the issuer.   
The terms typically provide that the   
conversion ratio will be tied to a fixed   
value of the aggregate underlying shares   
(typically a discount from the market   
price of the security at the time of the   
conversion rather than a conversion   
price per share).

30 In some cases the   
parties providing financing have   
engaged in extensive naked short selling   
designed to lower the price of the   
issuer‚Äôs stock, thus realizing profits   
when the debentures are converted to   
cover the short sales.

31  
Naked short selling has sparked   
defensive actions by some issuers   
designed to combat the potentially   
negative effects on shareholders, brokerdealers, and the clearance and   
settlement system.

32 Some issuers have   
taken actions to attempt to make transfer   
of their securities ‚Äò‚Äòcustody only,‚Äô‚Äô thus   
preventing transfer of their stock to or   
from securities intermediaries such as   
the Depository Trust Company (DTC) or   
broker-dealers. A number of issuers   
have attempted to withdraw their issued   
securities on deposit at DTC, which   
makes the securities ineligible for bookentry transfer at a securities depository.33 Withdrawing securities   
from DTC or requiring custody-only   
transfers undermine the goal of a   
national clearance and settlement   
system, designed to reduce the physical   
movement of certificates in the trading   
markets.",gym2eg3,t1_gylz299,[],1

All that says is that if you do locates (or say you did but didn‚Äôt, which our brokers won‚Äôt let us do as they handle it) and you can‚Äôt end up borrowing the shares then you may be forced to borrow them before executing short sales in the future. You normally do a locate when entering the order, but not all locates turn into a borrow as your order conditions may not get hit. So sometimes when you go to actually borrow the shares a couple hours later you find out that they aren‚Äôt available anymore because the party that had them sold them already.

If you do a locate, short the stock, then cover it 10 mins later you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. Everything will work out in clearing on that.",gym2fco,t1_gym1jry,[],0

963,2021-05-18,StockMarket,"Just an aside on cutting your losses. It is a lesson I learned the hard way.

An example:  I invested 20k in one particular high flying tech stock in 2000 at the height of the market.  It took a dive, like everything tech in 2001.  When the stock was down 50%, I invested another 5k -- averaging down, I thought.  It was a MISTAKE, I should have taken the 10k loss and moved on.  I did not.  I held and did nothing for 5 years.

But, alas, the misery (and this lesson) continues.  After revisiting my initial research and updating my DD on the company, I was still enamored with the company and its products -- another mistake.  In 2007, I invested another 5k at a price point significantly lower than 2001.   However,  I  did not learn my lesson from 2001. When the market tanked again in 2008, and the stock was down 50%, I invested another 5k -- averaging down, again.  BIG MISTAKE -- again! 

In summary, I invested a total of 35k in a 'wiz-bang' single tech stock between 2000 and 2008.  Today (2021) I am 'holding the bag' on 33k in unrealized losses.  IF I the discipline to cut my losses and ignore 'pie in the sky' dreams, I would have taken a 10k realized loss in 2001 instead of sitting on a 33k unrealized loss in 2021.
