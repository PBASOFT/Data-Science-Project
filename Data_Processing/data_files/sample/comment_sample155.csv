I think in the June FOMC JPOW finally will come out and say that they will consider tapering months later, when they expect economy to pick up and get back. JPOW talking about tapering will be big deal and the market will react. So far JPOW has been like: yeah, now is not the time to even talk about tapering. But at the back end, they have taking measures to tighten - like increasing Reverse Repo exchanges. Anyway, that's just my theory. And I have been wrong a lot of times. üòÖü§†",gzbkr37,t3_nk6ucy,[],0

No one is willing to short AMC or anything else to anywhere near the levels that they did with GME in January, because they know that wsb is watching and will target any stock with a high short interest.

And when you look at market cap, AMC right now is higher than it was at the peak in January.  Even though the price per share was higher, the company has diluted the absolute fuck out of their shares and there's now over 490 million shares outstanding. So retail has a harder job ahead of them if they want to buy up all the shares and force it even higher. And don't forget that the company still has another \~30 million shares they could sell, which again makes a squeeze even harder.

Despite all this, and despite the company facing a tough road ahead (even with theaters opening and even after selling literally hundreds of millions of shares), the company is valued at about 10x what it was pre-pandemic. The company's liabilities exceed its assets by over $2 billion, it's still losing a shitton of money, its rent and debt costs are increasing to the point where even if attendance returned to 100% of pre-COVID immediately, they would likely still be losing money at a rate where they're in danger of bankruptcy within a couple years.

Therefore, Karp sells some of his new exercised shares to pay for the tax on his options. Palantir by the way is extremely profitable and this is easily proven by looking at their margins on their q1 2021 report. If you don't count stock based comp then they would be profitable now.

>Jim Cramer is a bad guy. He has a show on the business channel, and he is also a stock trader. He is a good guy, and he tells people what stocks are good to buy and what stocks are bad to buy. He does this through his own personal opinion, but he has a very good track record. I have read his books and I have watched his show. He‚Äôs very entertaining to watch but he gets a little on your nerves sometimes. He yells at his guests a lot, but he is very knowledgeable. He is a good guy, and I would say that he is a leader.  
  
I think that the most important thing for a hero is to be a good person. I think that a hero must always do what is right and be a gentleman/woman.

Thats why many stocks that are doing good also fall. Because they usually had their run before and are correcting.

Its shitty but if you play differently you can profit from these, on the way up and down. Everything that gets overreaction from the market usually corrects. If it goes very high, you can expect to go lower , if it goes too low it will recover.

*FAQ*

*What does this mean?*

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

*Why did you do this?*

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

Rudeness towards other Redditors,
Spreading incorrect information,
Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

*Am I banned from the Reddit?*

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

*How can I prevent this from happening in the future?*

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",gzbnoem,t1_gzbn9wx,[],0

This is a big yikes and red flag to me. They're beta testing a mass scale product end of MARCH and expect to be producing them at scale in SEPT??

Assuming 2 months of beta testing puts us roughly at today, there's no way 3-4 months from now they have incorporated any significant feedback...if there are any major design changes required, it will push their timeline out months.

That's just how it works in the government contracting world. Usually ends up as a nothing burger. 

While I do believe there is merit in maybe breaking the contract up a bit more, I don't think the majority of these types of contracts are truly a one company gets all. 

Usually when awarded a massive contract, they are required to subcontract out a set amount of it to other companies. So it would be along the lines of msft +3 others. 

That being said, if pltr is to get any slice, it won't be directly. It'll probably be through IBM(if they can get in) They recently signed a true partnership with them for ai cloud stuff. Not like the superficial we made a add on for aws, that people hyped up. 

From what I've seen from news, it's all  unsubstantiated and reads like sports media. Unamed player in the lockeroom rumor type articles. 

Marketing teams and in house lawyers business as usual. 

Tbh, if anyone has the clout to do the unusual and screw msft out of this contract it will be Bezos. New hq in NoVa and owning the Washington post will be huge for him in the decades to come. 

Pltr also doesn't have the right clearance for this particular contract.

3181,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"Hedge fund sells call option contracts on stocks they believe will go down. Call option gives the buyer the option to purchase a stock at a given price. Buyer pays a fee for this privilege. If the stock goes down like they predict, buyer will not want to exercise their right to buy the stock at the old market price, since the price has now dipped. Contracts will expire. Hedge fund profits from the fees on the contracts as they expire. On the flip side, the stock may go up, and the buyer of the call option will be able to exercise their right to buy at any time before expiration date. Stock goes up, buyer can buy it for a cheaper than market price (set by the option contract), buyer profits from the increase in stock value, minus the fees for the contracts. It‚Äôs basically gambling on a stocks future price. Except in terms of potential loss from both scenarios, the buyer will lose a maximum of whatever the contract fees are (if the stock drops) and there is no limit to the sellers losses (if the stock goes up).

Put option contracts are essentially the opposite of all this.",gzbt8o5,t1_gzb8jd8,[],0

3799,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"A burst of bets against Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc., the company founded by billionaire Richard Branson, over the past month has ratcheted up the temperature for short-sellers after the company delivered a successful test flight over the weekend.

Nearly 14 million shares of the Las Cruces, New Mexico-based company were sold short over the past 30 days, meaning the stock‚Äôs Monday surge after a test flight has dealt short-sellers millions of dollars in losses, data compiled by financial analytics company S3 Partners show. With short interest sitting at $949 million, more than a fifth of shares available for trading are sold short and that could prompt bears to cover their bets, S3 Partners said.

That increase in short selling has already resulted in mark-to-market losses of $427 million for bears this year -- with $366 million of those losses occurring over the last eight days, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, wrote in a report Monday. With short bets against the company getting more crowded and as losses increase, the company appears to be ripe for a short squeeze, he wrote.",gzbv86d,t3_nkb27e,[],0

i asked some streamer i watch to quickly check it out, and he mentioned that there is basically no volume (prob why it doesnt move with adr like you mentioned, though i still need to research more about what an adr is, but i think i got the gist)

another thing he mentioned was that it trades with its 21 moving day average, so hes guessing a short term dip/correction https://imgur.com/x9vDgRE im not a trader so i dont understand this shit and im not even sure if my screenshot has the right moving average

it might be worth it to pay some randoms $5 to get some outside perspective on this, atleast personally i feel more assured when i know whats potentially the downsides to a stock i like

Another thing about inflation, do we know if this things dividend is ""decided"" in usd or won? As in if the dollar goes down will the dividend go up? or will korean owners dividend go down?

for example so they get 0,61usd which would be less won if the usd tanks, but if we get 600won and next year that is ie 0,70usd. i think thats how that would work right?

ill read up some more, but if it dips like it usually does its about time i get in, at this point if it goes back down to $12 the lost money will hurt less than the regret if it goes to $16",gzbveo5,t1_gz9rep8,[],0

3911,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,"I was somewhat right about the price drop, at least. But it looks like they haven't done too much of a shelf offering after the last year. I suppose when your stock is hovering around 75 cents, you'd have to be crazy to dilute it anymore.

In the end, a lot of the supporters really pushed the narrative that all the stock offerings wouldn't dilute the shareholders, but it really seemed to.

I'd like to see how many shares have changed hands over this past 3 months, because that could mean a lot of people consistently lost money on this investment.

I'd watch out for two things: one, are they doing anything illegal? Again, I'm not 100% on this, but for me the red flags are all there. Huge stock offerings leading up to times of massive liquidity injections and the suspicious and absurd options plays right before the company releases some news leads me to believe this could very well have been the company shorting its own stock by selling overly priced and wildly out of the money options leading up to the shelf offering in February.

The second thing is, do they even have the potential to raise very much in price anymore? It's not everyday that you have a multibillion dollar market cap on a penny stock, but when you do, I'd say \*avoid\*.

That being said, if you really like that 420 play, and you don't mind throwing down less than $100 for 100 shares, then just know it has absolutely no potential for a squeeze of any kind unless the company now buys back their stocks at a fraction of the cost at which they sold them in the first place. This is again a red flag for me, but I'm not hear to say the stock will go up or down. Oddly enough, I made money when it went up, and when it went down. 

Definitely glad to come back and revisit this though. This stock probably taught me the most of what I know about stocks, just based on the intuition that I had to explore to figure it out.

I'd also watch to see if they even have a good product. If you're an old enough Canadian to buy their products, and that's something you're interested in, I'd start there.

""There are different possible scenarios. One is that the economy zooms into a positive spiral of fast-tracked economic growth, other possibilities are not so rosy, like runaway inflation leading into a a rapid economic contraction and eventually a recession. This time though in an abrupt boom and sudden busy manner. Another scenario is multiple bubbles forming in the economy covering different sectors, Eg., real estate, mortgage loans, consumer credit, etc. then default rates accelerating as interest rates spike, followed by a liquidity and credit crunch that would lead the country into a recession as well. Every possible outcome will be greatly exacerbated though proportionally to the gargantuan excess of artificial liquidity we are under right now.""

Lost everything, went down to $10K. Sold the stock I bought cheap in March and my Ethereum for a 60% gain at $400 for another $50K determined to get back into it.

With short interest sitting at $949 million, more than a fifth of shares available for trading are sold short and that could prompt bears to cover their bets, S3 Partners said.

That increase in short selling has already resulted in mark-to-market losses of $427 million for bears this year -- with $366 million of those losses occurring over the last eight days, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, wrote in a report Monday.

We are a major supplier for Boeing, Northrup, Lockheed, Raytheon, etc. This is a really bold play. There is such a huge potential for downside here.

Boeing doesn't make shit. All their assembly-level components are made by large companies like mine. The industry is having such a fucking hard time sourcing parts right now due to covid. Small machine shops going under or are unable to ramp back up post-covid.

What this means for us is that we can't build a single, flight-critical component that needs to be on an airframe to fly because our supplier can no longer make a $20 shaft. 

So, we can't sell a $40,000 part because we can't get our hands on a $20 part. That also means Boeing can't sell a $450M plane because they can't get their hands on our $40,000 part. 

This is happening all over right now. Shit's fucked.

I genuinely think US manufacturing is going to be fucked for a while, once people get wind of how bad it is. Everyone is talking about the silicon shortage, but you can't find a fucking company to CNC and treat a shaft at scale right now.

Someone came back to it because they remembered my SPCE shares which of course did very well today. That was the first bit of green I have seen in a long time. I also bought and sold DKNG today (held for a couple hours), that was a nice little jumper.

I have to say it makes me happy that someone thinks I am a pro, because I assure you I am not. I'm a mom who does kinda normal-ish stuff. I guess anonymity is important here, but I'm just a regular chick. However, I did start trading in my 20s. I bought AOL and MSFT. I made a lot of money, sold, and then went to real estate. I have an old post on here somewhere and I talk about that whole story (lost a ton of money when I got divorced). 

To be honest, I have nothing beta-weighted and I don't hold any EFTs at the moment. I just have a lot of money. So I can take a $40k loss, but it was only 6% which is tolerable. Sometimes I do sell at a loss if I don't think a company is going to make it back. I absolutely  cost average down quite a bit and that saves me because I can claw my way out. 

Someone who is massive into fundamentals asked me today to teach them to trade and I'm thinking I have no idea really how to teach someone. I buy companies based on a couple things.... do I like the company, is it fundamentally sound, are they actually making money, is anyone talking about this company and is it favorable, are they in an industry that is coming alive or dying, what do the analysts think, where are they located (I stay away from companies in places I feel are sketchy), and then of course hype has become part of the equation.

Problem is you‚Äôre playing with a volatility option. Volatility options calls are more expensive than puts (just check your option chain) because they are there to mitigate tail risk (the risk of market crashing or aliens). The problem is you‚Äôre paying way OTM options where most of the value is coming from volatility or vega.

What happens after the reverse split is that all of a sudden you are not holding as many contracts. When that happens, the volatility of your position goes down (since you‚Äôre profiting 10x less from any market crashes). What happens usually at this point is that UVXY swan dives until it lands at a place right for its volatility.

Hydrogen is wayyyy less dense than typical fuel. Meaning you can only store so much energy with a tank of the same size. 

Generally 2 ways to solve this problem.
1. Have a bigger hydrogen tank - which is going to cost you a freak ton as metal isn‚Äôt cheap. 
2. Compress the hydrogen since it‚Äôs a gas. In this case, you will need thicker walls for your tank so that it can withstand the higher internal pressure. Plus, you will need failsafes in case pressure in the tank gets too high. Again, this translates into higher cost. 
3. And this is the most obvious one. Use batteries which Tesla has freaking proven will scale.

Why anyone would want to drive a vehicle with filled with highly explosive gas that can explode once your safety measures fails on demand is beyond me. I for one wouldn‚Äôt.

This happened many years ago. I had a classmate in college who carried the Bin-Sultan last name, he was one of many princes in the Saudi Royal family. For some reason Harvard rejected him, and he was stuck in my college hoping to get transferred to Harvard. We got pretty close, not friends, but hung out together at times.  

Once Al Waleed bin Talal Al Saud was talking on CNBC. Al Waleed is one of the most known (in finance) members of the Saudi royal family. His net worth at the time was in tens of billions. At one point he owned 15% of Citibank, which he was later forced to sell, he owned 20% of the Four Seasons, over 40% of Plaza Hotel, 5% of Apple, etc, etc. When seeing Al Waleed, my classmate said ""Al Waleed is just a loudmouth kid in the family, the real ""bosses"" are letting him run around and have fun. His net worth is nothing compared to the riches that elder family members have, but you'll never hear about them"".",gzcczlj,t1_gzan2dj,['AAPL'],1

Not sure where it's at on the 200 MA as my focus is on the 13,8,5 setup on the minute.  And when you focus on that, take a look at the huge move it made right at Close.  On both Price and Volume!  In fact when I look at that Close of 21.44 and the move it last made here after hours, of 21.70, it looks good.  So if it doesn't come out screaming it might very well take a dip and then take a move north.  Who knows though?  It all depends on who or whom are driving the volume.

Many companies have their employees buying in, in 3 scenario:

1- It's a cycle thing : Every year the company will buy back a small portion of it's all shares for the purpose of cheaper participation model or stock options. Statistically some will take the deal and the insider ratio increases.

2- It's an employment thing: Some companies insist that new employees should be given a certain amount of shares to make them ""involved in the company"" and employment recently skyrocketed (that's a more long term thing but it's worth mentioning)

3- Company is going bankrupt and is trying to maintain its share price by moving Top-exec/major investor shares to the employees, allowing those execs to pull-out.
