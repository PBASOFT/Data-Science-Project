If is a stock cannot do that, it’s dead weight and the money better invested in another stock.

If a stock looses a significant amount of its value, usually there is a reason to it. There is no reason to think that the value recovers fast.

But the market is growing for >20 years and so are Index Fonds. That is the Performance that every stock has to compete with. There is no reason to sit on a loss and wait  when there are many options to negate the loss.

In a professional environment,  the Maximum loss decides how many shares will be bought in the first place.

Reacting trends is important to make long term money. 

After 20 years of investment, i still loose money on many stocks.
The important thing is, that I got stopped out before I loose to much.  I may come back when they are trending again.

I know there is an ongoing fight between trend following scene and fundamental analysis folk. I guess it’s a valid argument hat the fundamentalists usually jump on the train early and make more money on a promising stock.

But it’s also true that many of them sit on their stocks for years and decades because „fundamentals are good and it’s undervalued“. 

Truth is, good fundamentals are worth nothing if you are the only one noticing it. You need the the trend at some point.
If the fundamentals are that good, the trend might come at some point. But that might take many years - time that the money would be better spend in trending investments or etf „parking spots“.",[],1

A candlestick on its own is just a candlestick.  That's why most of candlestick charting is about recognizing candlestick patterns, not just single candlesticks.  But then you have to see how the pattern fits into the larger context.  For example, a random hammer candle in the midst of a downtrend without any other signals is just a random hammer candle.  But if that same candle appears at a key level of support, or touches a lower trendline, and comes with twice the average volume, then you have a potential reversal signal.",[],0

Short sellers, like everyone else, want to make money, and taking the opposite position, they are prone to the same sort of profit taking & sentiment based selling as the rest of the market. If you, as a bull trader, saw that a major blue chip stock - say, a bank - was collapsing, what would be your normal response? Probably to take profits and cut your over all exposure to the market. This is the exact same reaction faced by bear traders when they see a massive short squeeze - they'll buy to cover a bunch of their positions to take profits & reduce short exposure.

This leads to their respective short stocks going up as the artificial weight is lifted, which then attracts swing traders, adding to the momentum. And that becomes a major rally - not because of any underlying fundamental, but because of market forces.",[],0

Obviously that hasn’t passed or even been introduced yet but if it does pass could effect them. It’s why MO went from $52 to $47, although it’s been recovering nicely. 

Second, while I agree on the weed play, keep in mind it’s under anti-trust review from the FTC because of the large interest it acquired in JUUL (the weed play). I assume if they lose they will have to divest themselves of JUUL and we lose our covert weed play to some degree, though I still think MO will get involved after federal legalization. 

In short, if you are okay with those risks, then it’s a good buy in price now and has potential later with weed legalization, but those are some decent sized risks.

In a Roth IRA, every dollar that you put in (you already paid income tax on). You can withdraw all of the amount you put in (Contributions) at any time, no fees, no penalties, no questions asked. But the GAINS in your Roth IRA is the portion that you can start withdrawing at age 59.5. If you try to withdraw earlier than that, you will pay tax&penalty.  However, there are a few exceptions that you can withdraw early, such as when you're a first time home buyer. Also you can withdraw money early from your 401K through your Roth IRA (kind of a loophole, called Roth IRA conversion ladder), but that's a bit more complex.  

Overall, a Roth IRA is one of the absolute best financial vehicles you can have, and I highly recommend maxing it out every single year, and not to withdraw an (even the original amounts you put in). Lemme know if you have any questions..",[],0

Personally, I'd sell off Carnival first out of all of these if you're green on it. United next. You're picking winners in a crowded and desperate market there and (I think) the reality of reopening won't live up to the anticipation that the stock market built in. Real estate depends on what sector you're in, is it residential building or commercial? If commercial I see less upside than residential construction but not a bad thing to hold onto.

I'd personally hold Disney, the management is excellent, the price is on what seems like a durable positive trend, and with reopening I expect a lot of good news coming for them (disclosure, I have stock in DIS).

If you’re intrinsically interested in investing and want to dive deeper, then I’d put some time into learning how to interpret a company’s financial statements, learn how to evaluate the fair price of a company, etc. In the long-term, it’ll be important to be invested in companies you like at the right price. There’s lots of information you can find to add these valuation tools to your toolbox. 

If you want a more passive approach that allows you to not think as much about it, then I’d focus more of your resources into broad market etf’s like VOO/VTI. In fact, both VOO and VTI have considerable overlap. A lot of people would suggest you just invest in one, and I think most would suggest VTI. However, there’s significant overlap and the difference in gains will be minimal. Another etf that could compliment VTI/VOO is an international-exclusive etf like VXUS. Not everyone invests in international etf’s though, so it’s just your personal preference. If you do, I would still keep a majority of it in VTI/VOO (like 80:20 or at most 70:30)

What they have are a bid, ask, and last.  The last is what is commonly referred to as the price, and it is the last price the stock traded at.  However you cannot make a trade at that price.  If you are buying you can only buy at the ask or higher meaning you can only buy at the price someone is willing to sell to you at.  You can set a limit and refuse to buy above a certain price but if the ask is higher than that your order will not be filled.  The same thing is true of selling but that is based on the highest bid.  What this means is that the price can change without any trades happening.  You can see this on very illiquid markets like out of the money options where both the bid/ask are well above or below the last meaning you will never get the last price for a new trade.  This also happens when a stock is halted.  When it resumes it will usually open a lot higher or lower than where it was previously trading.  The same thing could happen over the weekend if there is news.  Granted there will be trading in pre/post market but that is not happening over the weekend just Friday afternoon or Monday morning.",[],0

If the stock stays flat also it's not worthwhile imo as market averages 10% a year.    
    
In my honest opinion viac is going to rise also though so you get a dividend and you get appreciation of share price so returns will be higher.    
    
Dividend companies normally drop in share price after issuing dividends also. Because cash is removed from the company and given to shareholders. So as a company they have less money so they're worth less (in theory it should drop by exactly 0.24 dollars on 15th June - but you get it in cash as a shareholder.)",[],0

You need to start big and not small. You need to save for retirement, but first....  Learn basics to investing and not just doing short term trades of single stocks.

You need a retirement account, tax advantaged and put assets into market index funds that are safer. It isn't going for the big scores at once, but it safe to put larger assets into. You will get more back, by not feeling a need to be shy with only small amounts of money. It isn't the big score, but the advantage is you can safely put more money into it and time is your friend. The longer it is invested, the more it gains.

Then take a small portion of money on the side and you can work on individual stock trades. Don't risk so much that you can't lose it and were depending on that amount for retirement.
