Checking back after a few weeks and seeing it higher than you expected is an amazing feeling. You dont get that if you check it everyday and watch it slowly move up.

Its honestly liberating to know you have made good solid choices and dont have to watch it like a hawk everyday. If your choices are good, you wont be coming back to a massacre, and if it is lower, you know its only temp.

There is a bit of an addiction going on when you see it go up or down everyday. You become a lot more emotionally invested in it, and it hurts more when you see red on it, even if that red is only temp. 

Not watching it for weeks lets you get some distance, clarity, and you arent as attached or feel the pain as acutely when it goes red.

Not really.  The ""potential"" people kept claiming was that it would be the main electric car provider and beat out everybody else, but all the major brands have brand loyalty, better infrastructure, and are poised to pump out EVs when there's actually significant demand.

Their other ""potential"" would be their self driving, which is not even close to ""full self driving"" as it is so titled.  The fact alone that it's called ""full self driving"" in its current state should be a huge red flag.  That's be like calling a roomba a personal AI assistant.  Scumbag marketing

Their other ""potential"" is their solar capabilities.  Bailing out your failing company in what many deemed an illegal move, is not a plus.  

The only thing Tesla really has going for it at this point is their charging infrastructure and some nice looking cars (though with poor build quality concerns).  That ""potential"" does not justify the 1500 P/E that they had.",gyi05l9,t1_gyhh1ta,['AI'],1

420,2021-05-17,stocks,">but the potential of growth sort of justified it's hype

Not really.  The ""potential"" people kept claiming was that it would be the main electric car provider and beat out everybody else, but all the major brands have brand loyalty, better infrastructure, and are poised to pump out EVs when there's actually significant demand.

Their other ""potential"" would be their self driving, which is not even close to ""full self driving"" as it is so titled.  The fact alone that it's called ""full self driving"" in its current state should be a huge red flag.  That's be like calling a roomba a personal AI assistant.  Scumbag marketing

Their other ""potential"" is their solar capabilities.  Bailing out your failing company in what many deemed an illegal move, is not a plus.  

The only thing Tesla really has going for it at this point is their charging infrastructure and some nice looking cars (though with poor build quality concerns).  That ""potential"" does not justify the 1500 P/E that they had.",gyi05l9,t1_gyhh1ta,['AI'],1

Similarly, multiple expansion is a partial explanation for the explosion in growth names we saw following the covid crash, as interest rates plummeted -- increasing the relative value of those future earnings. 

With regard to Apple specifically, it actually has $130B in debt. It took on this debt because the interest rate is low, so it can use this money to buy back its own shares, on the assumption that its earnings will grow much faster than the interest rate on that debt. This allows Apple to increase its earnings per share, even through years where its earnings don't increase much (between major phone cycles, for example), with minimal financial risk.

Any other major auto company can outcompete Tesla on product today.

1. Software has no capabilities of choosing who will die or live in a near-sighted accident situations. - Legal issue.

To encounter point 1, I think we can eliminate human driving in the near future. By using central HD spatial data and install more IoT sensors ( geo fence, smart traffic control), we can achieve near 100% non human driving. The 5G will be crucial here. But there will be way less traffic, less accident, less death). With enough proves ( death rate statically), most of us will switch to full self driving car if it is free.

To encounter point 2, I think car insurance companies do not contribute to the growth of society. If I remember correctly, they even lobby the lawmaker to mandate this driver must have insurance law.

I feel more confident in buying Apple cause I have a long history of realized and unrealized gains with this stock. I’ve probably traded it dozens of times and by some miracle always been able to get in at a lower price than where I sold except for one time, which was when stocks sold off in March 2020. I could have gotten in lower but a “friend” convinced me that the sell off was nowhere close to over and I waited too long before buying back in. 

I currently have a January 2023 LEAPS in ICLN that I’m down 70% on (-$830). It was ITM when I bought it but it was really bad timing, right when all the clean energy and growth stocks started crashing. I thought I was buying the dip but it just kept dipping. Luckily it’s the smallest LEAPS I ever bought and it’s not a big portion of my portfolio but it is still annoying. I’m just going to hold in case it comes back. It needs to get back to $32 in order to just break even, which I guess isn’t totally out of the question, so I don’t think all hope is lost just yet.

I wouldn't be surprised if it continues to drop lower but now that it's lower than its reference point of 250, I think it might be at fair value for right now. But there are some major risks and uncertainty. Competitors that offer better deals and more coins will likely go public as well and bring competition COIN probably can't handle. I think as crypto market continues to grow, coin will definitely gain apart of that growth, however I really can't see any coin being mass adopted until a few years out, maybe a bit sooner.

Elon is definitely not helping right now. Most people still think all crypto is a scam and worthless, it'll take a while before most people even understand what blockchains are and what they're used for.

808,2021-05-18,stocks,"I am super bullish on COIN! Coinbase is one of the top 5 most profitable exchanges in the world. Coinbase might make more money than Nasdaq. Coinbase is going to be huge because this is the first time we are able to directly play crypto in the equity market. Why I like COIN is that it is a play on Bitcoin AND all the other coins out there...whereas bitcoin is just a play on bitcoin, so you are getting all the other coins for free. COIN is heavily (96%) tied to the price of bitcoin, which is very hard to predict. Another advantage of COIN being the first crypto exchange coming onto the market first is that they potentially can use their stock as currency to buy any other competitors. And you don't have to believe in the crypto party line and the dangers of fiat currency and how you need an alternative, because central banks all over the world are printing money like crazy - even if you think this is nonsense, we know that there is a market for this kind of nonsense because gold bugs have been saying the same thing for decades. In other words, crypto has a natural constituency. Like gold, people buy it as a kind of inflation insurance and gold's strength is its scarcity - its supply only increases about 1% per year and it is getting harder and harder to find more - that sounds a lot like Bitcoin to me and I think it is totally legitimate to believe that crypto, in general, can rival gold as a storehold of value.",gyika59,t3_ner6xo,[],0

You should realize that as long as Theranos was able to court a $9 billion dollar evaluation on pure speculation that their mouse trap was going to be leagues ahead of competitors based on words from a CEO, Tesla can be definitely valued at some crazy market cap too. It's whether or not the mass delusion has been figured out yet.

Even at today's value the share price can't be rationalized. It's purely cult of personality and the illusion of potential continued EV leadership and growth.

I've been working in Auto for 12 years and have been at a leading firm within the EV industry. Tesla has nothing that any other major manufacturer cannot do. They were first yes but a money making machine they are not. 

Also, Tesla cannot compete at scale by producing better cars. 

They provide worst quality cars at the behest of speed to manufacture. They absolutely oversell on what it does today (Autopilot) and continues to sell a feature that will likely never come to market (Level 5 autonomous) on their current hardware because it'd be incapable of actually meeting regulatory standards of the future.

I've learned reddit can be a great contrary indicator. The reddit hivemind is usually wrong based on the principle of being ""greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy"". A lot of new investors pile into the trends and don't really know what they're talking about. 

My stock portfolio is only down like 4% from it's ATH so I feel like I'm doing pretty well.

You can try to pin blame on whatever you want in 2007, but ultimately that was a tailspin from a liquidity binge that started with massive monetary easing after 9/11. They tried to reign it in and the banks that were leveraged to the hilt got shaken out. The banks are not as leveraged, but there are massive asset bubbles out there today. Bitcoin is currently worth more than JPM, GS and XOM combined. Come on. Will it pop tomorrow? Probably not, but I've staked my bet on oil because it is a highly price inelastic commodity that takes off when the economy is hot and the money supply explodes like it did in the post 9/11 era. The Fed sees the house of cards and isn't going to pump the brakes until inflation really heats up. It will be interesting to see if they can buy yields down indefinitely, though.

A leveraged ETF needs to adjusted daily and if the index goes sideways for long, there is a huge drag on the leveraged ETF returns and returns get negative. Here the base index is now at same price as 14 years ago.

I don't think it will recover to it's pre Covid levels.

That's one of the reason I sold the 70 call to buy the 75 call, so I had another $500 cash to put toward Apple. I don't want too great of a percent of my portfolio to be in one stock, but I'll buy it one more time if we see another significant dip.  If that were to happen I would probably go for a cheaper but more risky call with a higher strike. For example, if it dipped to 100 I might buy a strike of 125 which should be really cheap if that were to happen. Because at that point I think it would have dipped so much that it would have a really good chance of seeing a recovery.

1313,2021-05-18,stocks,"Let's simplify the issue to a basic example. This is usually a good way to get the crux of the question.

Let's say I establish a shell company and I contribute 100k in cash to shareholder equity. Nothing else. If I were to sell this shell company, I would always receive 100k for that company, as it has 100k in cash in assets and 100k in shareholder equity (let's not assume transactional costs, value of the name or anything else, let's just look at the balance sheet). Any owner could immediately reduce the equity by 100k and pay himself 100k in cash. Therefore the company is worth 100k. Owning the company is essentially the same as owning 100k in cash.

Now let's say that instead I use the company to buy back 50% of the shares from me for 50k. I will receive 50k in cash, the company receives 50% of its shares. If I were now to sell the company, I would get 50k for it, as the company has 50k in cash in assets and 50k in equity. The fact that the company could sell 50% of its shares means nothing for its valuation. Just as the technical fact, that the company could raise 1M or 1B does not make the shell company worth 1M or 1B. If it did raise 1B in cash, yes its valuation would go to 1B, but not just because it owns its own shares.

If in this example the company had retained its valuation of 100k after buying back 50% of its shares for 50k, I would have just made 50k out of thin air. As I physically received 50k for selling my shares to the company, yet still own the entire company. It's not logical that I just increased my wealth by doing nothing else than exchange shares with my own company.

Honestly this is beyond ludicrous where this sub has gotten to. If a company uses its cash to decrease share holder equity, thereby returning wealth to its shareholders, fundamentally the valuation of the company goes down. How could anyone think it wouldn't? If a company pays dividend from its cash, their valuation goes down. If a company pays wages to its employees, the valuation of the company goes down. It's a cost to the company. Money leaving the company. It's a 1-1 change between cash outflow and valuation.

Now, obviously investor sentiment and other factors not fundamentally tied to the balance sheet of the company have an effect on valuations on a stock market. Raising cash could scare away previous investors or it could create stronger belief in its growth. Paying investors through dividends or share buybacks could both improve the return on assets or it could put the company in trouble (liquidity issues, hamper growth etc). But what I am assuming here is that board decisions regarding capital allocations are (near) optimal and marginal changes in capital structure do not have a fundamental underlying impact on the company. All that changes is cash on hand.",gyjen23,t1_gyhqcz2,[],0
