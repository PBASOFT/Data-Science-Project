Plug Power finally removed the overhang of uncertainty after restatement and as I expected there was no misconduct or abuse of internal controls. Plug reached all-time high of 73.18$ in January 26 but unfortunately they reported some issue in their cash value that called for restatement.

On May 10 it reached the low of 20.07$ and now this week the restatement was completed and it actually showed increased in revenue for the Q1. 

I am bullish about Plug Power despite Cramer trying to put it down simply because he didn‚Äôt like that Plug had to do restatement ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Anyway, share your thoughts on comments. What do you think?",nfz4w0,[],0

2545,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Gold is for the most part useless. Similar to other nameless 'inflation hedges' that provide almost 0 current real world value. Might as well be beanie babies. However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

2551,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Just a quick heads up, retards! We are getting famous! My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

2561,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now.

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

2573,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Is there a fund where I can inverse Cathie Wood? I have followed Ms. Wood since she appeared on We Study Billionaires. From the minute I heard the interview I realized that this person had no clue what she was talking about. To the credit of the Podcast hosts they mentioned that ARKK would have issues with outflows leading to lower stock prices in a later Podcast, which they have. I should have shorted it, but I'm not rich. Here are some of her stances:

&#x200B;

She predicts CoinBit $500,000.

She is all-in on Tesla.

She thinks gene editing is a sound investment at this time.

She has decreased her position in Netflix.

&#x200B;

I think that the increase size of her fund will continue to limit her ability to invest in anything interesting. The longshots in her portfolio which have had massive success are often successful because her fund's investment has massively increased their market cap.  She has also tied herself so tightly to Tesla that she can never hop off that ride. She's tied to the autopilot whether it goes to the moon or into a tree. I'm not denying that she has had good results during this bull market, but I think a fund that goes the other direction will do very well over the next 5 years.

2581,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Alright ladies and gentlemen.... mostly just gentlemen. Hopefully y'all ain't gentle because this time we going HARD! I will be talking about Switch. A company that provides data centers to some of the world's most secure clientele.

  
What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

2586,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,[],0

Sector rotation, tech bubble fear, jump in 10-year treasury rate marked the beginning of inflation fear. And mistrust in FED that JPOW will not raise interest rate until at least 2023.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months.

2592,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,[],0

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

Most of what's on CNBC is entertainment or whatever obvious thing is happening in the world of boomer market makers. But sometimes there's a nice nugget of info to play with. I think there was one yesterday.

On Fast Money, after the segment with the chart guy, Nadine Terman of Solstein capital says (around 7:55 on the YT video, no link because mods will remove the post) that there was a possible ""hedge fund breaking down"" adding to the volatility yesterday. It's pretty clear that this isn't Archegos or Citadel level yet, but something to watch out for.

The question is this:  We know UWMC  is paying 5.5% interest on its $700b senior notes just issued and is paying 5.3% dividend on shareholders' money.  That captial is a drop in the bucket when it comes to making $54b of loans  which also are made at mortage rates of perhaps 2.5%. You can't borrow money at 5.5% and lend it at 2.5%  for long. 
Now I no stranger to REITs but people keep denying that UWMC  is a REIT. Of course it is - it just elects to be taxed as an LLC  rather than REIT.
REITs issue CMOs and all manner of instruments to raise the bulk of the cash they need to make loans and manage to contrive it in such a way that they pay lower interest rate in that borrowing than the interest received on mortgage loans. When they sell the CMOS they are moreover off-book (non-recourse) with the REIT  merely servicing them for a small fee.

Can somebody point to where UWMC is doing the same,  or what are they doing to get $54b of cash at less than mortgage rate. Are they selling bundles of loans to Freddie Mac or what?",ngmtae,[],0

The Fed is the enemy of the bottom 50% & the friend of the top 1%. It rewards those with access to large capital & it punishes those that don‚Äôt with price distortions in the real economy. 

 

Let me start with I am one of the bottom 50 % : But this time ,this bottom 50 % wil get the rewards .

Let's start with Fundamentals ,then dig our mistakes and try not to repeat again ,and lastly final count down : Tic Toc :

1- Fundamental : What is the real story today  ? 

Reverse repo usage just surpassed Covid crash highs. We are effectively out of repo market collateral, Fed is cornered, and there is no place to park $1TN more in reserves.

The market understood this harsh reality : Fed can't do 18 more months of QE;

2. Our last days favorite subject : Somebodies call it beast , somebody says transitory , but I call it my best friend  ""INFLATION "" 

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

In fact this is a reality that all of us knows , but until now Fed always insist to use TRANSITORY . Because ƒ±nflation is something that you do not see . Inflation is something that you feel . I am sure all of us less or more were feeling in last days . 

SO HEADLINE FOR METAL OWNERS : FED ADMITTED THAT INFLATION MAY NOT BE TRANSITORY 

Please don't blame especially silver owners because they are waiting 10 years this moment to come  and what a wonderful to hear from : 

From  Fed  :""A number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and, if so, these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year.""

 Assuming you are in the right form of Silver investment , Lets dig on silver ( right form of silver allocated Silver ETFS( PSLV , ZSƒ∞L )  plus all kind of silver bars , coins , junk whatever shinny staff ) 

"" It is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions. ""

Now we are ready as 50 % bottom to soar while inflation our best friend already here , yields are not increasing due to above reasons 

&#x200B;

Sƒ∞LVER THE INVESTMENT OF DECADE NOW FULLY READY : 

 There are many ways to mess things up even if one is right on the larger trend. This Silver bull market  is the true opportunity of our lifetime. The real one. And it is here since 12.5 months. Set aside time to learn. Don¬¥t mess this up. And don¬¥t wake up to it in 2 years time. 

We got the big breakout last week, this week  using closing prices.  I am expecting [$SILVER](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SILVER&src=cashtag_click) to move at least 10x from here in long term , which means that silver juniors will move 30x - 40x from here, with the best moving way over 100x.  This is life-changing money if played right.

 I think that is what we have here for silver. It has charged itself for a good move now. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN? Now  we are in 9 th month so Tƒ∞C TOC

We‚Äôve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17 to $14.38 high on 5/17.  Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19 with freaky similar volume changes) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22.......

Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28.

Cheap way to place a bet if the squeeze doesn‚Äôt materialize that could be a >10x return based on how cheap the <$10 puts are for 5/21 and 5/28 put options.

If you are holding stock, max gains you are getting for $20 is ~2x but this could be the real money maker with puts sub $10 priced at $0.01-$0.05 that could go to $0.5+ if the stock slides similar to the March slide.

2607,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"Sundial‚Äôs investment strategy could be the bright spot for investors to hang their hats on going forward. George stated, ‚ÄúI am pleased with our investment track record, which began with our internal program and is evolving to include partnership with third party capital.‚Äù¬† He added, ‚ÄúOur strong financial position, unique cultivation facility and focus on premium inhalables have positioned us for improved performance in the second half of 2021 and beyond.‚Äù

The company remains focused on making operational improvements. It‚Äôs also continuing to developing even higher potency cannabis strains. Sundial plans to begin marketing some of these new strains beginning in the fourth quarter of this year.

Sundial continued to invest in its evolving library of strains, utilization of data insights and continuous improvement in the Olds facility to achieve higher potency and more consistent quality metrics. Sundial received its first laboratory results for its new extended library of genetics and will prioritize the strains with higher THC potency results. The Company plans to commercialize these new strains in Q4 2021.

Following the cultivation restructuring efforts commenced in mid-2020, potency and quality metrics have continued to be a focus in 2021. In¬†February 2021, Sundial harvested its highest potency flower since the Olds facility‚Äôs inception with Top Leaf‚Äôs LA Kush Cake initial lots producing potency in excess of 28% THC. The product has seen strong velocity in sales during the first quarter with some stores selling out in two days. Sundial has seen higher potency, yields and terpenes through the first quarter, increasing its average potency results by approximately 15%, year over year.

Sundial‚Äôs commitment to premium products remains steadfast, and the Company will become more selective and limit accessibility of its discount segment products to select customers, where the economics are attractive. The price dynamics of the discount segment are not sustainable for Sundial‚Äôs portfolio and assets. The Company will focus on its most profitable and higher margin SKUs, while continuing to further simplify its supply chain and rationalize SKUs across all brands and formats to help better position and optimize its products.

Sundial continues to work on research and development and a purposeful and robust innovation pipeline focused on inhalable products. Sundial launched two concentrates SKUs in the first quarter of 2021 and the Company implemented an approach targeted on the most profitable segments of its portfolio including Sundial‚Äôs new partnerships with Simply Solventless Concentrates Ltd. and Stigma Grow, in the development of additional concentrates offerings.

While continuing to focus on branded sales, Sundial has seen an increased sales trend in the wholesale market due to its focus on cultivation excellence and other licensed producers divesting from cultivation practices.

Sundial‚Äôs cultivation and production costs were reduced to an average of¬†$4 million¬†per month in the first quarter 2021 from¬†$10 million¬†per month in the first quarter of 2020 through efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives. Cultivation and production costs have stabilized through the first quarter of 2021.

Sundial‚Äôs facility in Olds amended its licence for standard processing authorizing the activity of sale for cannabis extract, cannabis topical and edible cannabis products, in addition to the previously granted licences for standard cultivation and for sale for medical purposes.

¬†

CWEB Analyst‚Äôs have initiated a BUY Rating for Sundial Growers Inc. (NASDAQ:¬†SNDL) and potential upside of $6-$8 in 2021. The fundamentals of the company are to strong and cash on hand is unrestricted cash balance of approximately¬†$752.7 million without any debt. We believe Q2 and Q3 will be the real break for the company with more positive cash flow and new contracts.¬†Sundial¬†(NASDAQ:¬†SNDL) recorded its first-ever adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 million in¬†Q1 2021¬†compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $5.6 million in the prior quarter.

However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

**SPY Results:**

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

2930,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. 

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

2955,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,[],0
2956,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Ever since the Feb peak, the sell pressure has been high and news pieces coming out one after another to give investors reason to sell. Sector rotation, tech bubble fear, jump in 10-year treasury rate marked the beginning of inflation fear. And mistrust in FED that JPOW will not raise interest rate until at least 2023.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

2959,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

2961,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,[],0

Most of what's on CNBC is entertainment or whatever obvious thing is happening in the world of boomer market makers. But sometimes there's a nice nugget of info to play with. I think there was one yesterday.

On Fast Money, after the segment with the chart guy, Nadine Terman of Solstein capital says (around 7:55 on the YT video, no link because mods will remove the post) that there was a possible ""hedge fund breaking down"" adding to the volatility yesterday. It's pretty clear that this isn't Archegos or Citadel level yet, but something to watch out for. 

Personal take: I'd have cash on hand short-term (until end of summer) to take advantage of extended volatility and wait for PowPow to either put his foot down or start anti-stimmy talks.

2970,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"So nobody will answer me, just calling me names,  suggesting they don't have an answer either.
The question is this:  We know UWMC  is paying 5.5% interest on its $700b senior notes just issued and is paying 5.3% dividend on shareholders' money.  That captial is a drop in the bucket when it comes to making $54b of loans  which also are made at mortage rates of perhaps 2.5%. You can't borrow money at 5.5% and lend it at 2.5%  for long. 
Now I no stranger to REITs but people keep denying that UWMC  is a REIT. Of course it is - it just elects to be taxed as an LLC  rather than REIT.
REITs issue CMOs and all manner of instruments to raise the bulk of the cash they need to make loans and manage to contrive it in such a way that they pay lower interest rate in that borrowing than the interest received on mortgage loans. When they sell the CMOS they are moreover off-book (non-recourse) with the REIT  merely servicing them for a small fee.

Can somebody point to where UWMC is doing the same,  or what are they doing to get $54b of cash at less than mortgage rate. Are they selling bundles of loans to Freddie Mac or what?",ngmtae,[],0

The Fed is the enemy of the bottom 50% & the friend of the top 1%. It rewards those with access to large capital & it punishes those that don‚Äôt with price distortions in the real economy. 

 

Let me start with I am one of the bottom 50 % : But this time ,this bottom 50 % wil get the rewards .

Let's start with Fundamentals ,then dig our mistakes and try not to repeat again ,and lastly final count down : Tic Toc :

1- Fundamental : What is the real story today  ? 

Reverse repo usage just surpassed Covid crash highs. We are effectively out of repo market collateral, Fed is cornered, and there is no place to park $1TN more in reserves.

The market understood this harsh reality : Fed can't do 18 more months of QE;

2. Our last days favorite subject : Somebodies call it beast , somebody says transitory , but I call it my best friend  ""INFLATION "" 

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

In fact this is a reality that all of us knows , but until now Fed always insist to use TRANSITORY . Because ƒ±nflation is something that you do not see . Inflation is something that you feel . I am sure all of us less or more were feeling in last days . 

SO HEADLINE FOR METAL OWNERS : FED ADMITTED THAT INFLATION MAY NOT BE TRANSITORY 

Please don't blame especially silver owners because they are waiting 10 years this moment to come  and what a wonderful to hear from : 

From  Fed  :""A number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and, if so, these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year.""

 Assuming you are in the right form of Silver investment , Lets dig on silver ( right form of silver allocated Silver ETFS( PSLV , ZSƒ∞L )  plus all kind of silver bars , coins , junk whatever shinny staff ) 

"" It is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions. ""

Now we are ready as 50 % bottom to soar while inflation our best friend already here , yields are not increasing due to above reasons 

&#x200B;

Sƒ∞LVER THE INVESTMENT OF DECADE NOW FULLY READY : 

 There are many ways to mess things up even if one is right on the larger trend. This Silver bull market  is the true opportunity of our lifetime. The real one. And it is here since 12.5 months. Set aside time to learn. Don¬¥t mess this up. And don¬¥t wake up to it in 2 years time. 

We got the big breakout last week, this week  using closing prices.  I am expecting [$SILVER](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SILVER&src=cashtag_click) to move at least 10x from here in long term , which means that silver juniors will move 30x - 40x from here, with the best moving way over 100x.  This is life-changing money if played right.

 I think that is what we have here for silver. It has charged itself for a good move now. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN? Now  we are in 9 th month so Tƒ∞C TOC

Cheap way to place a bet if the squeeze doesn‚Äôt materialize that could be a >10x return based on how cheap the <$10 puts are for 5/21 and 5/28 put options.

George stated, ‚ÄúI am pleased with our investment track record, which began with our internal program and is evolving to include partnership with third party capital.‚Äù¬† He added, ‚ÄúOur strong financial position, unique cultivation facility and focus on premium inhalables have positioned us for improved performance in the second half of 2021 and beyond.‚Äù

The company remains focused on making operational improvements. It‚Äôs also continuing to developing even higher potency cannabis strains. Sundial plans to begin marketing some of these new strains beginning in the fourth quarter of this year.

Sundial continued to invest in its evolving library of strains, utilization of data insights and continuous improvement in the Olds facility to achieve higher potency and more consistent quality metrics. Sundial received its first laboratory results for its new extended library of genetics and will prioritize the strains with higher THC potency results. The Company plans to commercialize these new strains in Q4 2021.

Following the cultivation restructuring efforts commenced in mid-2020, potency and quality metrics have continued to be a focus in 2021. In¬†February 2021, Sundial harvested its highest potency flower since the Olds facility‚Äôs inception with Top Leaf‚Äôs LA Kush Cake initial lots producing potency in excess of 28% THC. The product has seen strong velocity in sales during the first quarter with some stores selling out in two days. Sundial has seen higher potency, yields and terpenes through the first quarter, increasing its average potency results by approximately 15%, year over year.

Sundial‚Äôs commitment to premium products remains steadfast, and the Company will become more selective and limit accessibility of its discount segment products to select customers, where the economics are attractive. The price dynamics of the discount segment are not sustainable for Sundial‚Äôs portfolio and assets. The Company will focus on its most profitable and higher margin SKUs, while continuing to further simplify its supply chain and rationalize SKUs across all brands and formats to help better position and optimize its products.

Sundial continues to work on research and development and a purposeful and robust innovation pipeline focused on inhalable products. Sundial launched two concentrates SKUs in the first quarter of 2021 and the Company implemented an approach targeted on the most profitable segments of its portfolio including Sundial‚Äôs new partnerships with Simply Solventless Concentrates Ltd. and Stigma Grow, in the development of additional concentrates offerings.

While continuing to focus on branded sales, Sundial has seen an increased sales trend in the wholesale market due to its focus on cultivation excellence and other licensed producers divesting from cultivation practices.

Sundial‚Äôs cultivation and production costs were reduced to an average of¬†$4 million¬†per month in the first quarter 2021 from¬†$10 million¬†per month in the first quarter of 2020 through efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives. Cultivation and production costs have stabilized through the first quarter of 2021.

Sundial‚Äôs facility in Olds amended its licence for standard processing authorizing the activity of sale for cannabis extract, cannabis topical and edible cannabis products, in addition to the previously granted licences for standard cultivation and for sale for medical purposes.

¬†

CWEB Analyst‚Äôs have initiated a BUY Rating for Sundial Growers Inc. (NASDAQ:¬†SNDL) and potential upside of $6-$8 in 2021. The fundamentals of the company are to strong and cash on hand is unrestricted cash balance of approximately¬†$752.7 million without any debt. We believe Q2 and Q3 will be the real break for the company with more positive cash flow and new contracts.¬†Sundial¬†(NASDAQ:¬†SNDL) recorded its first-ever adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 million in¬†Q1 2021¬†compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $5.6 million in the prior quarter.

However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

3200,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Just a quick heads up, retards! We are getting famous! My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

I hope, you‚Äôre happy now, u/memetron9000!

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

3210,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. 

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

3230,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Alright ladies and gentlemen.... mostly just gentlemen. Hopefully y'all ain't gentle because this time we going HARD! I will be talking about Switch. A company that provides data centers to some of the world's most secure clientele.

  
What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,[],0

Sector rotation, tech bubble fear, jump in 10-year treasury rate marked the beginning of inflation fear. And mistrust in FED that JPOW will not raise interest rate until at least 2023.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen. 

At the same time, the indexes are still hover around all time high. Remember how excited this sub was when SPY edging $400 and we are now still at $410. Meanwhile small growth stocks have 5% - 10% up and down days regularly and overall down 30% - 50% from ATH.

3239,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

3241,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,[],0

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

Most of what's on CNBC is entertainment or whatever obvious thing is happening in the world of boomer market makers. But sometimes there's a nice nugget of info to play with. I think there was one yesterday.

On Fast Money, after the segment with the chart guy, Nadine Terman of Solstein capital says (around 7:55 on the YT video, no link because mods will remove the post) that there was a possible ""hedge fund breaking down"" adding to the volatility yesterday. It's pretty clear that this isn't Archegos or Citadel level yet, but something to watch out for.

The question is this:  We know UWMC  is paying 5.5% interest on its $700b senior notes just issued and is paying 5.3% dividend on shareholders' money.  That captial is a drop in the bucket when it comes to making $54b of loans  which also are made at mortage rates of perhaps 2.5%. You can't borrow money at 5.5% and lend it at 2.5%  for long. 
Now I no stranger to REITs but people keep denying that UWMC  is a REIT. Of course it is - it just elects to be taxed as an LLC  rather than REIT.
REITs issue CMOs and all manner of instruments to raise the bulk of the cash they need to make loans and manage to contrive it in such a way that they pay lower interest rate in that borrowing than the interest received on mortgage loans. When they sell the CMOS they are moreover off-book (non-recourse) with the REIT  merely servicing them for a small fee.

2. Our last days favorite subject : Somebodies call it beast , somebody says transitory , but I call it my best friend  ""INFLATION "" 

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

In fact this is a reality that all of us knows , but until now Fed always insist to use TRANSITORY . Because ƒ±nflation is something that you do not see . Inflation is something that you feel . I am sure all of us less or more were feeling in last days . 

SO HEADLINE FOR METAL OWNERS : FED ADMITTED THAT INFLATION MAY NOT BE TRANSITORY 

Please don't blame especially silver owners because they are waiting 10 years this moment to come  and what a wonderful to hear from :

We got the big breakout last week, this week  using closing prices.  I am expecting [$SILVER](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SILVER&src=cashtag_click) to move at least 10x from here in long term , which means that silver juniors will move 30x - 40x from here, with the best moving way over 100x.

3256,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"Sundial‚Äôs investment strategy could be the bright spot for investors to hang their hats on going forward. George stated, ‚ÄúI am pleased with our investment track record, which began with our internal program and is evolving to include partnership with third party capital.‚Äù¬† He added, ‚ÄúOur strong financial position, unique cultivation facility and focus on premium inhalables have positioned us for improved performance in the second half of 2021 and beyond.‚Äù

The company remains focused on making operational improvements. It‚Äôs also continuing to developing even higher potency cannabis strains. Sundial plans to begin marketing some of these new strains beginning in the fourth quarter of this year.

Sundial continued to invest in its evolving library of strains, utilization of data insights and continuous improvement in the Olds facility to achieve higher potency and more consistent quality metrics. Sundial received its first laboratory results for its new extended library of genetics and will prioritize the strains with higher THC potency results. The Company plans to commercialize these new strains in Q4 2021.

Following the cultivation restructuring efforts commenced in mid-2020, potency and quality metrics have continued to be a focus in 2021. In¬†February 2021, Sundial harvested its highest potency flower since the Olds facility‚Äôs inception with Top Leaf‚Äôs LA Kush Cake initial lots producing potency in excess of 28% THC. The product has seen strong velocity in sales during the first quarter with some stores selling out in two days. Sundial has seen higher potency, yields and terpenes through the first quarter, increasing its average potency results by approximately 15%, year over year.

Sundial‚Äôs commitment to premium products remains steadfast, and the Company will become more selective and limit accessibility of its discount segment products to select customers, where the economics are attractive. The price dynamics of the discount segment are not sustainable for Sundial‚Äôs portfolio and assets. The Company will focus on its most profitable and higher margin SKUs, while continuing to further simplify its supply chain and rationalize SKUs across all brands and formats to help better position and optimize its products.

Sundial continues to work on research and development and a purposeful and robust innovation pipeline focused on inhalable products. Sundial launched two concentrates SKUs in the first quarter of 2021 and the Company implemented an approach targeted on the most profitable segments of its portfolio including Sundial‚Äôs new partnerships with Simply Solventless Concentrates Ltd. and Stigma Grow, in the development of additional concentrates offerings.

While continuing to focus on branded sales, Sundial has seen an increased sales trend in the wholesale market due to its focus on cultivation excellence and other licensed producers divesting from cultivation practices.

Sundial‚Äôs cultivation and production costs were reduced to an average of¬†$4 million¬†per month in the first quarter 2021 from¬†$10 million¬†per month in the first quarter of 2020 through efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives. Cultivation and production costs have stabilized through the first quarter of 2021.

Sundial‚Äôs facility in Olds amended its licence for standard processing authorizing the activity of sale for cannabis extract, cannabis topical and edible cannabis products, in addition to the previously granted licences for standard cultivation and for sale for medical purposes.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

**SPY Results:**

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

3764,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. 

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

3789,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,[],0
3790,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Ever since the Feb peak, the sell pressure has been high and news pieces coming out one after another to give investors reason to sell.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

3793,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

3795,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,[],0

Most of what's on CNBC is entertainment or whatever obvious thing is happening in the world of boomer market makers. But sometimes there's a nice nugget of info to play with. I think there was one yesterday.

On Fast Money, after the segment with the chart guy, Nadine Terman of Solstein capital says (around 7:55 on the YT video, no link because mods will remove the post) that there was a possible ""hedge fund breaking down"" adding to the volatility yesterday. It's pretty clear that this isn't Archegos or Citadel level yet, but something to watch out for. 

Personal take: I'd have cash on hand short-term (until end of summer) to take advantage of extended volatility and wait for PowPow to either put his foot down or start anti-stimmy talks.

3804,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"So nobody will answer me, just calling me names,  suggesting they don't have an answer either.
The question is this:  We know UWMC  is paying 5.5% interest on its $700b senior notes just issued and is paying 5.3% dividend on shareholders' money.  That captial is a drop in the bucket when it comes to making $54b of loans  which also are made at mortage rates of perhaps 2.5%. You can't borrow money at 5.5% and lend it at 2.5%  for long. 
Now I no stranger to REITs but people keep denying that UWMC  is a REIT. Of course it is - it just elects to be taxed as an LLC  rather than REIT.
REITs issue CMOs and all manner of instruments to raise the bulk of the cash they need to make loans and manage to contrive it in such a way that they pay lower interest rate in that borrowing than the interest received on mortgage loans. When they sell the CMOS they are moreover off-book (non-recourse) with the REIT  merely servicing them for a small fee.

Can somebody point to where UWMC is doing the same,  or what are they doing to get $54b of cash at less than mortgage rate. Are they selling bundles of loans to Freddie Mac or what?",ngmtae,[],0
3805,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets," Measurable data leads to one inescapable conclusion: 

The Fed is the enemy of the bottom 50% & the friend of the top 1%. It rewards those with access to large capital & it punishes those that don‚Äôt with price distortions in the real economy. 

 

Let me start with I am one of the bottom 50 % : But this time ,this bottom 50 % wil get the rewards .

Let's start with Fundamentals ,then dig our mistakes and try not to repeat again ,and lastly final count down : Tic Toc :

1- Fundamental : What is the real story today  ? 

Reverse repo usage just surpassed Covid crash highs. We are effectively out of repo market collateral, Fed is cornered, and there is no place to park $1TN more in reserves.

The market understood this harsh reality : Fed can't do 18 more months of QE;

2. Our last days favorite subject : Somebodies call it beast , somebody says transitory , but I call it my best friend  ""INFLATION "" 

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

In fact this is a reality that all of us knows , but until now Fed always insist to use TRANSITORY . Because ƒ±nflation is something that you do not see . Inflation is something that you feel . I am sure all of us less or more were feeling in last days . 

SO HEADLINE FOR METAL OWNERS : FED ADMITTED THAT INFLATION MAY NOT BE TRANSITORY 

Please don't blame especially silver owners because they are waiting 10 years this moment to come  and what a wonderful to hear from : 

From  Fed  :""A number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and, if so, these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year.""

 Assuming you are in the right form of Silver investment , Lets dig on silver ( right form of silver allocated Silver ETFS( PSLV , ZSƒ∞L )  plus all kind of silver bars , coins , junk whatever shinny staff ) 

"" It is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions. ""

Now we are ready as 50 % bottom to soar while inflation our best friend already here , yields are not increasing due to above reasons 

&#x200B;

Sƒ∞LVER THE INVESTMENT OF DECADE NOW FULLY READY : 

 There are many ways to mess things up even if one is right on the larger trend. This Silver bull market  is the true opportunity of our lifetime. The real one. And it is here since 12.5 months. Set aside time to learn. Don¬¥t mess this up. And don¬¥t wake up to it in 2 years time. 

We got the big breakout last week, this week  using closing prices.  I am expecting [$SILVER](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SILVER&src=cashtag_click) to move at least 10x from here in long term , which means that silver juniors will move 30x - 40x from here, with the best moving way over 100x.  This is life-changing money if played right.

 I think that is what we have here for silver. It has charged itself for a good move now. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN? Now  we are in 9 th month so Tƒ∞C TOC

3810,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"Sundial‚Äôs investment strategy could be the bright spot for investors to hang their hats on going forward. George stated, ‚ÄúI am pleased with our investment track record, which began with our internal program and is evolving to include partnership with third party capital.‚Äù¬† He added, ‚ÄúOur strong financial position, unique cultivation facility and focus on premium inhalables have positioned us for improved performance in the second half of 2021 and beyond.‚Äù

The company remains focused on making operational improvements. It‚Äôs also continuing to developing even higher potency cannabis strains. Sundial plans to begin marketing some of these new strains beginning in the fourth quarter of this year.

Sundial continued to invest in its evolving library of strains, utilization of data insights and continuous improvement in the Olds facility to achieve higher potency and more consistent quality metrics. Sundial received its first laboratory results for its new extended library of genetics and will prioritize the strains with higher THC potency results. The Company plans to commercialize these new strains in Q4 2021.

Following the cultivation restructuring efforts commenced in mid-2020, potency and quality metrics have continued to be a focus in 2021. In¬†February 2021, Sundial harvested its highest potency flower since the Olds facility‚Äôs inception with Top Leaf‚Äôs LA Kush Cake initial lots producing potency in excess of 28% THC. The product has seen strong velocity in sales during the first quarter with some stores selling out in two days. Sundial has seen higher potency, yields and terpenes through the first quarter, increasing its average potency results by approximately 15%, year over year.

Sundial‚Äôs commitment to premium products remains steadfast, and the Company will become more selective and limit accessibility of its discount segment products to select customers, where the economics are attractive. The price dynamics of the discount segment are not sustainable for Sundial‚Äôs portfolio and assets. The Company will focus on its most profitable and higher margin SKUs, while continuing to further simplify its supply chain and rationalize SKUs across all brands and formats to help better position and optimize its products.

Sundial continues to work on research and development and a purposeful and robust innovation pipeline focused on inhalable products. Sundial launched two concentrates SKUs in the first quarter of 2021 and the Company implemented an approach targeted on the most profitable segments of its portfolio including Sundial‚Äôs new partnerships with Simply Solventless Concentrates Ltd. and Stigma Grow, in the development of additional concentrates offerings.

While continuing to focus on branded sales, Sundial has seen an increased sales trend in the wholesale market due to its focus on cultivation excellence and other licensed producers divesting from cultivation practices.

Sundial‚Äôs cultivation and production costs were reduced to an average of¬†$4 million¬†per month in the first quarter 2021 from¬†$10 million¬†per month in the first quarter of 2020 through efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives. Cultivation and production costs have stabilized through the first quarter of 2021.

Sundial‚Äôs facility in Olds amended its licence for standard processing authorizing the activity of sale for cannabis extract, cannabis topical and edible cannabis products, in addition to the previously granted licences for standard cultivation and for sale for medical purposes.

¬†

CWEB Analyst‚Äôs have initiated a BUY Rating for Sundial Growers Inc. (NASDAQ:¬†SNDL) and potential upside of $6-$8 in 2021. The fundamentals of the company are to strong and cash on hand is unrestricted cash balance of approximately¬†$752.7 million without any debt. We believe Q2 and Q3 will be the real break for the company with more positive cash flow and new contracts.¬†Sundial¬†(NASDAQ:¬†SNDL) recorded its first-ever adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 million in¬†Q1 2021¬†compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $5.6 million in the prior quarter.

- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

To the credit of the Podcast hosts they mentioned that ARKK would have issues with outflows leading to lower stock prices in a later Podcast, which they have. I should have shorted it, but I'm not rich. Here are some of her stances:

She thinks gene editing is a sound investment at this time.

She has decreased her position in Netflix.

I think that the increase size of her fund will continue to limit her ability to invest in anything interesting.

4019,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Alright ladies and gentlemen.... mostly just gentlemen. Hopefully y'all ain't gentle because this time we going HARD! I will be talking about Switch. A company that provides data centers to some of the world's most secure clientele.

  
What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,[],0

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

4030,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,[],0

Most of what's on CNBC is entertainment or whatever obvious thing is happening in the world of boomer market makers. But sometimes there's a nice nugget of info to play with. I think there was one yesterday.

On Fast Money, after the segment with the chart guy, Nadine Terman of Solstein capital says (around 7:55 on the YT video, no link because mods will remove the post) that there was a possible ""hedge fund breaking down"" adding to the volatility yesterday. It's pretty clear that this isn't Archegos or Citadel level yet, but something to watch out for.

The question is this:  We know UWMC  is paying 5.5% interest on its $700b senior notes just issued and is paying 5.3% dividend on shareholders' money.  That captial is a drop in the bucket when it comes to making $54b of loans  which also are made at mortage rates of perhaps 2.5%. You can't borrow money at 5.5% and lend it at 2.5%  for long. 
Now I no stranger to REITs but people keep denying that UWMC  is a REIT. Of course it is - it just elects to be taxed as an LLC  rather than REIT.
REITs issue CMOs and all manner of instruments to raise the bulk of the cash they need to make loans and manage to contrive it in such a way that they pay lower interest rate in that borrowing than the interest received on mortgage loans. When they sell the CMOS they are moreover off-book (non-recourse) with the REIT  merely servicing them for a small fee.

Can somebody point to where UWMC is doing the same,  or what are they doing to get $54b of cash at less than mortgage rate. Are they selling bundles of loans to Freddie Mac or what?",ngmtae,[],0

2. Our last days favorite subject : Somebodies call it beast , somebody says transitory , but I call it my best friend  ""INFLATION "" 

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

In fact this is a reality that all of us knows , but until now Fed always insist to use TRANSITORY . Because ƒ±nflation is something that you do not see . Inflation is something that you feel . I am sure all of us less or more were feeling in last days . 

SO HEADLINE FOR METAL OWNERS : FED ADMITTED THAT INFLATION MAY NOT BE TRANSITORY 

Please don't blame especially silver owners because they are waiting 10 years this moment to come  and what a wonderful to hear from : 

From  Fed  :""A number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and, if so, these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year.""

I am expecting [$SILVER](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SILVER&src=cashtag_click) to move at least 10x from here in long term , which means that silver juniors will move 30x - 40x from here, with the best moving way over 100x.

George stated, ‚ÄúI am pleased with our investment track record, which began with our internal program and is evolving to include partnership with third party capital.‚Äù¬† He added, ‚ÄúOur strong financial position, unique cultivation facility and focus on premium inhalables have positioned us for improved performance in the second half of 2021 and beyond.‚Äù

The company remains focused on making operational improvements. It‚Äôs also continuing to developing even higher potency cannabis strains. Sundial plans to begin marketing some of these new strains beginning in the fourth quarter of this year.

Sundial continued to invest in its evolving library of strains, utilization of data insights and continuous improvement in the Olds facility to achieve higher potency and more consistent quality metrics. Sundial received its first laboratory results for its new extended library of genetics and will prioritize the strains with higher THC potency results. The Company plans to commercialize these new strains in Q4 2021.

Following the cultivation restructuring efforts commenced in mid-2020, potency and quality metrics have continued to be a focus in 2021. In¬†February 2021, Sundial harvested its highest potency flower since the Olds facility‚Äôs inception with Top Leaf‚Äôs LA Kush Cake initial lots producing potency in excess of 28% THC. The product has seen strong velocity in sales during the first quarter with some stores selling out in two days. Sundial has seen higher potency, yields and terpenes through the first quarter, increasing its average potency results by approximately 15%, year over year.

Sundial‚Äôs commitment to premium products remains steadfast, and the Company will become more selective and limit accessibility of its discount segment products to select customers, where the economics are attractive. The price dynamics of the discount segment are not sustainable for Sundial‚Äôs portfolio and assets. The Company will focus on its most profitable and higher margin SKUs, while continuing to further simplify its supply chain and rationalize SKUs across all brands and formats to help better position and optimize its products.

Sundial continues to work on research and development and a purposeful and robust innovation pipeline focused on inhalable products. Sundial launched two concentrates SKUs in the first quarter of 2021 and the Company implemented an approach targeted on the most profitable segments of its portfolio including Sundial‚Äôs new partnerships with Simply Solventless Concentrates Ltd. and Stigma Grow, in the development of additional concentrates offerings.

While continuing to focus on branded sales, Sundial has seen an increased sales trend in the wholesale market due to its focus on cultivation excellence and other licensed producers divesting from cultivation practices.

Sundial‚Äôs cultivation and production costs were reduced to an average of¬†$4 million¬†per month in the first quarter 2021 from¬†$10 million¬†per month in the first quarter of 2020 through efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives. Cultivation and production costs have stabilized through the first quarter of 2021.

Sundial‚Äôs facility in Olds amended its licence for standard processing authorizing the activity of sale for cannabis extract, cannabis topical and edible cannabis products, in addition to the previously granted licences for standard cultivation and for sale for medical purposes.

CWEB Analyst‚Äôs have initiated a BUY Rating for Sundial Growers Inc. (NASDAQ:¬†SNDL) and potential upside of $6-$8 in 2021. The fundamentals of the company are to strong and cash on hand is unrestricted cash balance of approximately¬†$752.7 million without any debt.

4534,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,[],0

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit‚Äôs Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‚Äòbuy‚Äô recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit‚Äôs Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‚Äòbuy‚Äô recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

5175,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Gold is for the most part useless. Similar to other nameless 'inflation hedges' that provide almost 0 current real world value. Might as well be beanie babies. However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

5191,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. 

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

5216,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,[],0

5220,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

5222,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,[],0

Most of what's on CNBC is entertainment or whatever obvious thing is happening in the world of boomer market makers. But sometimes there's a nice nugget of info to play with. I think there was one yesterday.

On Fast Money, after the segment with the chart guy, Nadine Terman of Solstein capital says (around 7:55 on the YT video, no link because mods will remove the post) that there was a possible ""hedge fund breaking down"" adding to the volatility yesterday. It's pretty clear that this isn't Archegos or Citadel level yet, but something to watch out for. 

Personal take: I'd have cash on hand short-term (until end of summer) to take advantage of extended volatility and wait for PowPow to either put his foot down or start anti-stimmy talks.

5231,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"So nobody will answer me, just calling me names,  suggesting they don't have an answer either.
The question is this:  We know UWMC  is paying 5.5% interest on its $700b senior notes just issued and is paying 5.3% dividend on shareholders' money.  That captial is a drop in the bucket when it comes to making $54b of loans  which also are made at mortage rates of perhaps 2.5%. You can't borrow money at 5.5% and lend it at 2.5%  for long. 
Now I no stranger to REITs but people keep denying that UWMC  is a REIT. Of course it is - it just elects to be taxed as an LLC  rather than REIT.
REITs issue CMOs and all manner of instruments to raise the bulk of the cash they need to make loans and manage to contrive it in such a way that they pay lower interest rate in that borrowing than the interest received on mortgage loans. When they sell the CMOS they are moreover off-book (non-recourse) with the REIT  merely servicing them for a small fee.

Can somebody point to where UWMC is doing the same,  or what are they doing to get $54b of cash at less than mortgage rate. Are they selling bundles of loans to Freddie Mac or what?",ngmtae,[],0

The Fed is the enemy of the bottom 50% & the friend of the top 1%. It rewards those with access to large capital & it punishes those that don‚Äôt with price distortions in the real economy. 

 

Let me start with I am one of the bottom 50 % : But this time ,this bottom 50 % wil get the rewards .

Let's start with Fundamentals ,then dig our mistakes and try not to repeat again ,and lastly final count down : Tic Toc :

1- Fundamental : What is the real story today  ? 

Reverse repo usage just surpassed Covid crash highs. We are effectively out of repo market collateral, Fed is cornered, and there is no place to park $1TN more in reserves.

The market understood this harsh reality : Fed can't do 18 more months of QE;

2. Our last days favorite subject : Somebodies call it beast , somebody says transitory , but I call it my best friend  ""INFLATION "" 

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

In fact this is a reality that all of us knows , but until now Fed always insist to use TRANSITORY . Because ƒ±nflation is something that you do not see . Inflation is something that you feel . I am sure all of us less or more were feeling in last days . 

SO HEADLINE FOR METAL OWNERS : FED ADMITTED THAT INFLATION MAY NOT BE TRANSITORY 

Please don't blame especially silver owners because they are waiting 10 years this moment to come  and what a wonderful to hear from : 

From  Fed  :""A number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and, if so, these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year.""

 Assuming you are in the right form of Silver investment , Lets dig on silver ( right form of silver allocated Silver ETFS( PSLV , ZSƒ∞L )  plus all kind of silver bars , coins , junk whatever shinny staff ) 

"" It is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions. ""

Now we are ready as 50 % bottom to soar while inflation our best friend already here , yields are not increasing due to above reasons 

&#x200B;

Sƒ∞LVER THE INVESTMENT OF DECADE NOW FULLY READY : 

 There are many ways to mess things up even if one is right on the larger trend. This Silver bull market  is the true opportunity of our lifetime. The real one. And it is here since 12.5 months. Set aside time to learn. Don¬¥t mess this up. And don¬¥t wake up to it in 2 years time. 

We got the big breakout last week, this week  using closing prices.  I am expecting [$SILVER](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SILVER&src=cashtag_click) to move at least 10x from here in long term , which means that silver juniors will move 30x - 40x from here, with the best moving way over 100x.  This is life-changing money if played right.

 I think that is what we have here for silver. It has charged itself for a good move now. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN? Now  we are in 9 th month so Tƒ∞C TOC

We‚Äôve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17 to $14.38 high on 5/17.  Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19 with freaky similar volume changes) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22.......

Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28.  If AMC goes on a similar slide to the March slide, there will be massive returns on these ridiculously cheap put options (9.9% decline today and the sub $10 puts barely moved in price on both the 5/21 and 5/28 expiration dates.

Cheap way to place a bet if the squeeze doesn‚Äôt materialize that could be a >10x return based on how cheap the <$10 puts are for 5/21 and 5/28 put options.

If you are holding stock, max gains you are getting for $20 is ~2x but this could be the real money maker with puts sub $10 priced at $0.01-$0.05 that could go to $0.5+ if the stock slides similar to the March slide.

5237,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"Sundial‚Äôs investment strategy could be the bright spot for investors to hang their hats on going forward. George stated, ‚ÄúI am pleased with our investment track record, which began with our internal program and is evolving to include partnership with third party capital.‚Äù¬† He added, ‚ÄúOur strong financial position, unique cultivation facility and focus on premium inhalables have positioned us for improved performance in the second half of 2021 and beyond.‚Äù

The company remains focused on making operational improvements. It‚Äôs also continuing to developing even higher potency cannabis strains. Sundial plans to begin marketing some of these new strains beginning in the fourth quarter of this year.

Sundial continued to invest in its evolving library of strains, utilization of data insights and continuous improvement in the Olds facility to achieve higher potency and more consistent quality metrics. Sundial received its first laboratory results for its new extended library of genetics and will prioritize the strains with higher THC potency results. The Company plans to commercialize these new strains in Q4 2021.

Following the cultivation restructuring efforts commenced in mid-2020, potency and quality metrics have continued to be a focus in 2021. In¬†February 2021, Sundial harvested its highest potency flower since the Olds facility‚Äôs inception with Top Leaf‚Äôs LA Kush Cake initial lots producing potency in excess of 28% THC. The product has seen strong velocity in sales during the first quarter with some stores selling out in two days. Sundial has seen higher potency, yields and terpenes through the first quarter, increasing its average potency results by approximately 15%, year over year.

Sundial‚Äôs commitment to premium products remains steadfast, and the Company will become more selective and limit accessibility of its discount segment products to select customers, where the economics are attractive. The price dynamics of the discount segment are not sustainable for Sundial‚Äôs portfolio and assets. The Company will focus on its most profitable and higher margin SKUs, while continuing to further simplify its supply chain and rationalize SKUs across all brands and formats to help better position and optimize its products.

Sundial continues to work on research and development and a purposeful and robust innovation pipeline focused on inhalable products. Sundial launched two concentrates SKUs in the first quarter of 2021 and the Company implemented an approach targeted on the most profitable segments of its portfolio including Sundial‚Äôs new partnerships with Simply Solventless Concentrates Ltd. and Stigma Grow, in the development of additional concentrates offerings.

While continuing to focus on branded sales, Sundial has seen an increased sales trend in the wholesale market due to its focus on cultivation excellence and other licensed producers divesting from cultivation practices.

Sundial‚Äôs cultivation and production costs were reduced to an average of¬†$4 million¬†per month in the first quarter 2021 from¬†$10 million¬†per month in the first quarter of 2020 through efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives. Cultivation and production costs have stabilized through the first quarter of 2021.

Sundial‚Äôs facility in Olds amended its licence for standard processing authorizing the activity of sale for cannabis extract, cannabis topical and edible cannabis products, in addition to the previously granted licences for standard cultivation and for sale for medical purposes.

¬†

CWEB Analyst‚Äôs have initiated a BUY Rating for Sundial Growers Inc. (NASDAQ:¬†SNDL) and potential upside of $6-$8 in 2021. The fundamentals of the company are to strong and cash on hand is unrestricted cash balance of approximately¬†$752.7 million without any debt. We believe Q2 and Q3 will be the real break for the company with more positive cash flow and new contracts.¬†Sundial¬†(NASDAQ:¬†SNDL) recorded its first-ever adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 million in¬†Q1 2021¬†compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $5.6 million in the prior quarter.

5240,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,[],0

BSV is the most shorted coin. If we pump the price up all of the shorters will be forced to cover their positions and the price will skyrocket. Also, if you look at the ownership of large amounts of BSV coins, the majority are owned by very long term wallets who have never touched their coins in years and years. This means that the supply of coins is very low and it will not be hard to pump the price. This is our chance at gamestop2.0 but this time it'll be bigger. So let's pump it and take what is ours.

Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter.

I would like you all to understand, however, that buying call options on the Teucrium Corn fund that tracks a mix of Corn futures could lead to a profitable trade. It is an accessible and liquid way to trade the price of corn. Corn the US crop that has had its highs and lows over a long history but continues to have massive demand worldwide for a variety of uses and it is not slowing. Instead, weather risks, drought risks, execution risks, and other supply chain bottlenecks have impacts on the prices in the short and mid term and sometimes the long term. 
BEFORE you make any investment decision in Corn, let‚Äôs run through these important things:
1. WHO grows corn?
The 2 leading producers of corn include the US at 1 and China at 2 that is over 50% of total production. 
2. WHO consumes Corn?
Well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs The US and China accounting for over 50% of total consumption 
3.WHO is the top exporter?
The US is the top exporter
4.WHO is top importer?
China is the top importer by far (Mexico was for years until this year and commitments for next year)
5. Risks?
As with every investment there is always downside risk! The downside risk here could be from many different factors, however, these are less likely and at current corn prices already priced in. 
These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil. 
-The absence of supply chain disruptions which, let‚Äôs face it, is not the theme so far in 2021.

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit‚Äôs Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‚Äòbuy‚Äô recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

¬†
What was it like in the last moments of the Titanic? The blissful sleep of many in beds, the simple smoke on the deck, or the tipple of brandy in the smoking room. All of this catastrophically undermined by the unwavering mass of nature‚Äôs immovable strength, a piece of the cold heart of the earth itself, which with some strange justice strikes back at the callous and overconfident nature of man in its dominance of the world. Massive, unwavering, indestructible, Unsinkable. I can only imagine there was a moment of calm after the crash. Although many were flung from beds and decks, there will have been a moment of levity: ‚ÄúPerhaps we are fine‚Äù, they would think, ‚Äúthere must be something wrong with the engine‚Äù, ‚Äúmaybe we bumped into something, at least its over‚Äù. 
¬†

Have you ever been in a moment of sudden trauma, where something so bad has happened, you end up trying to convince yourself that reality is fine. That the world will return to 10 seconds ago. That nothing bad can possibly happen to you like this. You take every piece of evidence you see around you that tells you that it is fine, and you embrace it so tightly that if it could breathe it would have choked to death long ago.

¬†
Reality is cruel, so much so that we choose to ignore it. From a wrapper on the floor, to a sudden death in the family. in that moment we often choose to ignore the issue at hand. We simply ‚Äúkeep going‚Äù, like worker bees to our pollen we keep going about out our honey business, while the forest burns around us.

¬†
Why this overdramatic analogy? Those on the Titanic would not have seen themselves as part of the greatest fallacy of modern mankind at the time. They would not understand they were about to break new ground in modern horrors, of safety failures that would define an industry. They were scared and only saw the room around them fill with water. They would see only the space on a lifeboat for themselves and their family. They would not know a hole as large as a bus was in their ship, they would not know the unbreakable had just had its spine snapped like a twig under a boot. They would not know, nae could never know, that the ‚ÄòUnskinable‚Äô, the ‚ÄòToo Big To Fail‚Äô, had just ‚Äòfailed‚Äô.

¬†
We do not have an iceberg to grand us such a luxury as a starting bell to signify the last round of this bulls world. Nothing so obvious and dramatic you would think. Yet look back at 2008, or 1999. Bubbles that popped, dirty laundry that came to the surface. ‚ÄúHow were we so blind, it was so obvious that it was about to happen‚Äù they say. With the benefit of the view we know that ¬†Bear Sterns was such an easy indicator of the end. Yet now, now we look back and we see that we struck the iceberg. We see the hole in our ship, and we see that the first to take those lifeboats are the rich. Who at their last moments stole those life jackets, and took boats that had so much room for more, yet they took them to themselves. So that they may be comfortable when the ice waters of debt come ever close to our ship. We all could have lived, those boats could have fit 4 times more. But they will never share. They will never warn.
¬†

We do not have their foresight, we do not have the data, nor the expertise, nor the resources to see the end coming. We can only ‚Äúfeel‚Äù and guess. Take what little information we have left. For when the last ship sunk, the captain, our wonderful governments did not see it coming. They used us to keep the boat up as long as they could, and we died and died and died, so that those precious rich few may live, and be rescued to go on living.
¬†

I may be wrong, we all may be wrong, but a note strikes me that we have hit our iceberg. We hit it long ago, and now we are dead in the water. Those icy depths hang beneath us, beckoning for our souls to calm their restless temperaments. The denial of the end haunts us all, even those who believe it has come have nagging thoughts ‚Äúsurely it won‚Äôt be that bad, surely it will pass quickly and we can go back home, they wouldn‚Äôt let it all sink‚Äù. They will let you die, and not just so they can live, so they can live comfortably.
But this time theirs a small difference. We cannot prove it conclusively, we only have our best and brightest who steer us right, but we see that their lifeboats were bets, bets against the inevitable that they knew about. They were going to use the corpses of the dead, the GME, the AMC and the many others to float them to safety, while the rest freezes and dies, or burns with the glorious wreck. But we grabbed those boats and told them NO, these are for everyone, we save as many as we can, and you will pay for the bill, for steering us so callously into death.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

6748,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"So about me: Got into trading last year, was unemployed, don't have trader tax status

So my question is regarding deducting a large capital loss last year against a large capital gain this year and if there is a 3k cap on that if i don't have trader tax status?

for example, if last year (2020), let's say i had 20k in capital loss from stocks. Now this year (2021), let's say i have 100k in capital gains. CAn i deduct the full 20k capital loss from last year to this year's 100k capital loss, making my taxable capital gain income essentially 80k? OR since i just a regular trader with no trader tax status with the IRS, i can only deduct 3k of that capital loss this each and the remainder carries over each year, making this year's taxable capital gain income 97k?

I'm reading online and there is so many conflicting info. Some say that it's 3k max each year, and you will only be able to deduct 3k until you deduct the full capital loss through the years, every year. Others say that only up to 3k of the 20k loss is deductible if it is against ""Regular income"", but if you have a huge capital gain this year (like 100k in this example), you can deduct the full 20k for this year.

I know, before you guys say go to speak to an expert cpa and etc...yes yes i know, i will.. But i am still also wanting to hear advice or answer of anyone who's been in this situation before.

6781,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,[],1

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

LAS CRUCES, N.M.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SPCE) (‚ÄúVirgin Galactic‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), a vertically integrated aerospace and space travel company, today confirmed that the next rocket-powered test flight of SpaceShipTwo Unity will be conducted on May 22, pending weather and technical checks. This follows the completion of a maintenance review of VMS Eve, the mothership jet aircraft designed to carry SpaceShipTwo to an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet.

‚ÄúFollowing a detailed inspection and thorough analysis of our mothership, Eve, we have cleared our Spaceflight System for our upcoming flight. I want to thank our incredibly talented team of engineers, maintenance crew, quality inspectors and support staff for their diligence and hard work, which is testament to our commitment to safety and the integrity of our flight test program,‚Äù said Michael Colglazier, Chief Executive Officer of Virgin Galactic.

Virgin Galactic regularly monitors its vehicles to verify their condition and inform timing of future upgrades and modifications that can improve performance or reduce future maintenance work. A post-flight inspection of VMS Eve in early May called for further engineering analysis to assess a known maintenance item in the tail of the vehicle, which was scheduled to be addressed during the next maintenance period. This analysis has been completed with the Company determining structures healthy, clearing Eve for flight.

The upcoming VSS Unity test flight will be crewed by two pilots and will carry research payloads as part of the NASA Flight Opportunities program. A key objective of the upcoming flight will be to test the remedial work that has been completed on VSS Unity to lower the EMI levels experienced on the December 12, 2020 flight when the onboard computer halted ignition of the rocket motor. The flight will also incorporate all original test objectives, including assessment of the upgraded horizontal stabilizers and flight controls during the boost phase of the flight, evaluating elements of the customer cabin, and testing the live stream capability from the spaceship to the ground.

Following this May flight, and in line with normal procedures, the team will complete an extensive data review, which will inform the next steps in the test flight program.",ngx67o,['SPCE'],1

Another thing that I noticed was that the large spikes were only attributed to changes from medium to high regimes.

And small spikes are associated with changes from low to high

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

9275,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Gold is for the most part useless. Similar to other nameless 'inflation hedges' that provide almost 0 current real world value. Might as well be beanie babies. However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

**Keypath IPO is another Macquarie (Australian Investment Bank) listing and is only to being listed as a path for the private equity owners and key staff to cash out their shares. The IPO values the company at around USD800million yet shows no path to ever achieving profitability.  Beware.**

Keypath IPO

Keypath Education is a US based education business that is soon to IPO in  Australia - not sure why they don't do it in the USA...

Keypath Education has been building its business since 2014 (7 years) and is  yet to turn a profit. Each year Keypath Education adds additional  programs (Masters) to drive additional student enrollments and revenue.  Additions of programs requires investment in learning design. The more  Keypath Education invests in learning design the greater its future  growth will be as this means new programs are being developed or  existing programs are being refreshed.

High overheads

Old  programs grow stale and over time drive lower revenue, so ever  increasing investment in programs is required to drive revenue growth  year on year.

The second part of  Keypath Education driving revenue growth is through marketing. Keypath  Education primarily drives student enrollments via online marketing  primarily Google and Facebook, but also a range of online sources.  Keypath Education is operating in a highly competitive market which  results in high marketing costs as a proportion of revenue. Higher  marketing spend drives higher enrollments which drives revenue. If  marketing spend is reduced enrollments reduce.

**Covid black swan to the rescue**

The  covid pandemic was a black swan event which saw a large portion of its  largest market (Australia) in lockdown for a good part of half a year  which the government paying people to not work and doubling welfare  payments to unemployed. This saw a large spike in enrollments over 2020  and 2021 as people turned to study to improve chances of re-entering the  workforce or to upskill while they were under lockdown.

Keypath‚Äôs  financial statements for the years 2020, 2019 and 2018 Statement of  Cash Flows shows increasing investment in its program offering  (Additions of amortizable assets), with investments increasing 50% over  the three years. Meanwhile existing programs also see increasing  depreciation as the investment in those programs depreciates in value.

However  the financial statements for the half year ended 31 December 2020 shows  something interesting. While revenues have increased substantially  (70%) marketing spend only increased 42%. This means the marketing spend  over the 6 months ended Dec 2020 was much more ""effective"" than that in  the six months ended Dec 2019. Additionally salaries and wages, which  reflect investment in people to generate sales and retain existing  students only grew 43% - in line with marketing.

What  this means is that Keypath Educations recent jump in revenue is not  sustainable and was only due to the Covid pandemic as people were left  with little to do but study.

What  this means is Keypath Education saw a windfall gain in enrollments due  to Covid without a resulting higher investment in either marketing or  staff to enroll those students. Keypath Education was converting  marketing spend at a rate far higher than in previous periods. This is  an abnormal situation and is unlikely to continue as people return to  work and life returns to normal.

**Diminishing investment in the business**

Further  Keypath Education's additions to amortizable intangible assets was  lower in the Dec 2020 half than in prior periods. This means Keypath  Education invested less in its business. As new courses see diminishing  enrollments as they mature this under investment in building and  maintaining courses will show itself over the coming years. If Keypath  Education isn‚Äôt building and maintaining its existing programs at ever  higher rates its revenue will eventually plateau then decline.

Keypath's  main revenue drivers is number of new students and its ability to  retain existing students. However if you read the offer documents both  of these drivers are completely absent, instead is hundreds of pages of  fluff about minimal investment in technology to market itself as a  ""tech"" business. It's nothing more than a sales and marketing arm of  universities. Definitely not a true tech business. The rest of the offer  document is fluff about diversity and how Keypath Education isn't just  like every other Online Program Management business in a very crowded  market.

What Keypath‚Äôs IPO  represents is a private equity firm that is desperate to exit a loss  making business that cannot turn a profit. The Covid epidemic saw a  windfall temporary increase in enrollments, which combined with reduced  investment in its product and reduced marketing and staff spend gives  the impression of a business about to turn a profit. This could not be  further from the truth.

**Recent jump in revenue not sustainable**

As  life returns to normal, the unemployment rates in Australia and the USA  are driven below 5% and 4% online education will become less appealing  and driving new enrollments will become much more competitive, requiring  substantially more investment in refreshing programs and higher  marketing and staff spend to convert leads to enrolments and retain them  in study.

Further Keypath  Education's Dec 2020 results are inflated by gains on currency  revaluation and movements in the AUD to the USD over the 6 months, this  adds approximately 1.5m to its bottom line, which in future periods  won't be recurring.

In their  attached financial statements Note 6 Amortization of intangibles (2020,  2019 and 2018 years). This note reflects that the amortization expense  on intangibles (namely, its course development) is forecast to decrease  substantially from 2021 through to 2025. If no future investment is made  this points to a downward investment in the future of the business in  order to drive short-term profitability and the share price at the  expense of the long-term growth of the business.

**Keypath Australia is running out of growth**

Keypath  Education has drawn a large portion of its growth from being one of the  first movers into the Australian market with which Keypath Education  found little competition. This allowed Keypath Education to add from  FY15 to FY18 three partners, then another three in FY 19. However this  slowed to two new partners and FY20 and in FY21 only one partner was  added. There is diminishing opportunities for Keypath to growth in  Australia with much of the low hanging fruit in terms of partners and  programs already developed.

**Future of exiting programs**

Page  70 of the prospectus illustrates the expiry of Keypath Education's  contracts. A full 74% of contracts will expire over the next six years.  Over this time university partners, boosted by Covid pushing their  programs online are going to find ways to reduce costs and learn how to  deliver successful online programs themselves.

There  is no guarantee these contracts once they expire will roll forward to  longer contracts and if they do, the universities are likely to demand  better terms once the industry is at maturity than they did in the  growth phase for OPM over the last six years. This is a major risk for  Keypath, as just as it is moving towards smaller losses it might find  its revenue streams dry up, with increased competition and lower margins  offered by its existing partners.

**Keypath in Canada and UK**

Keypath  Education's business in the UK and Canada has been a failure. Keypath  found the Canadian and UK markets not conductive to the type of rapid  growth a private equity business seeks in new markets. This has resulted  in little revenue growth in these markets and little prospect for  future growth.

**KeypathEdge fake ""eductech""**

Keypath  Education markets itself as an ‚Äúedutech‚Äù business to boost its tech  credentials. However the fact is Keypath has little sophisticated  technology, much of its platforms are based on Microsoft platforms or  other purchased software used for course development. Keypath is not a  ‚Äòtech‚Äô business, it is more accurately described as a marketing and  sales business which is where the vast majority of its expenditure sits.  This is why it has high operating costs but relatively small  investments in technology.

**Another Macquarie Bank Pump and Dump**

Keypath  Education is highly over valued based on its proposed offer price. This  will be a float like Macquarie Bank's other recent famous IPO Nuix  which was tainted by inflated numbers, fraud and has tanked and will be  very unlikely to return to its IPO 'valuation'.

Keypath  has no path to profit, requires massive investment just to keep pumping  out new courses and due to the intense competition in the industry must  spend a massive proportion of its revenues on marketing and staff to  keep students from dropping out after finding the online learning  experience less than satisfactory.

Usually a company like GM should be trading at a multiple, instead they are trading for half the market cap of total earnings. Not saying this is the only factor but is definitely there. The EV vehicle transitions followed by announcements, release dates, increased earnings, new jobs all could be leading factors why GM stock reaches $90.

My plays are as follow: 

1. BUY GM OPTION $90 TARGET EXPIRATION JAN 2022 x 10 contracts
2. BUY GM OPTION $90 TARGET EXPIRATION JAN 2023 x 10 contracts

GM has the infastructure to support a massive takeover of EV, Tesla can barely deliver cars to people that ordered them 6 months ago. The market cap difference is $650 Billion. When GM siphons some of that market cap you can see GM stock trading anywhere from $150 to $300 making traders profits of anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million in profits. Check Options profit calculator for that option play and look at profit targets of $90 to $300. It will show what each option will be worth at each price level

9867,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Gold is for the most part useless. Similar to other nameless 'inflation hedges' that provide almost 0 current real world value. Might as well be beanie babies. However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

I hope, you‚Äôre happy now, u/memetron9000!

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ‚Äôs results are very similar to SPY‚Äôs results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

¬∑ In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

¬∑ Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

¬∑ QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

9883,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. 

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

She has decreased her position in Netflix.

I think that the increase size of her fund will continue to limit her ability to invest in anything interesting.

9903,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Alright ladies and gentlemen.... mostly just gentlemen. Hopefully y'all ain't gentle because this time we going HARD! I will be talking about Switch. A company that provides data centers to some of the world's most secure clientele.

  
What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either.

It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",ngftx1,[],0

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen.

9912,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

9914,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns.",nghmhm,[],0

Most of what's on CNBC is entertainment or whatever obvious thing is happening in the world of boomer market makers. But sometimes there's a nice nugget of info to play with. I think there was one yesterday.

On Fast Money, after the segment with the chart guy, Nadine Terman of Solstein capital says (around 7:55 on the YT video, no link because mods will remove the post) that there was a possible ""hedge fund breaking down"" adding to the volatility yesterday. It's pretty clear that this isn't Archegos or Citadel level yet, but something to watch out for.

The question is this:  We know UWMC  is paying 5.5% interest on its $700b senior notes just issued and is paying 5.3% dividend on shareholders' money.  That captial is a drop in the bucket when it comes to making $54b of loans  which also are made at mortage rates of perhaps 2.5%. You can't borrow money at 5.5% and lend it at 2.5%  for long. 
Now I no stranger to REITs but people keep denying that UWMC  is a REIT. Of course it is - it just elects to be taxed as an LLC  rather than REIT.
REITs issue CMOs and all manner of instruments to raise the bulk of the cash they need to make loans and manage to contrive it in such a way that they pay lower interest rate in that borrowing than the interest received on mortgage loans. When they sell the CMOS they are moreover off-book (non-recourse) with the REIT  merely servicing them for a small fee.

George stated, ‚ÄúI am pleased with our investment track record, which began with our internal program and is evolving to include partnership with third party capital.‚Äù¬† He added, ‚ÄúOur strong financial position, unique cultivation facility and focus on premium inhalables have positioned us for improved performance in the second half of 2021 and beyond.‚Äù

The company remains focused on making operational improvements. It‚Äôs also continuing to developing even higher potency cannabis strains. Sundial plans to begin marketing some of these new strains beginning in the fourth quarter of this year.

Sundial continued to invest in its evolving library of strains, utilization of data insights and continuous improvement in the Olds facility to achieve higher potency and more consistent quality metrics. Sundial received its first laboratory results for its new extended library of genetics and will prioritize the strains with higher THC potency results. The Company plans to commercialize these new strains in Q4 2021.

Following the cultivation restructuring efforts commenced in mid-2020, potency and quality metrics have continued to be a focus in 2021. In¬†February 2021, Sundial harvested its highest potency flower since the Olds facility‚Äôs inception with Top Leaf‚Äôs LA Kush Cake initial lots producing potency in excess of 28% THC. The product has seen strong velocity in sales during the first quarter with some stores selling out in two days. Sundial has seen higher potency, yields and terpenes through the first quarter, increasing its average potency results by approximately 15%, year over year.

Sundial‚Äôs commitment to premium products remains steadfast, and the Company will become more selective and limit accessibility of its discount segment products to select customers, where the economics are attractive. The price dynamics of the discount segment are not sustainable for Sundial‚Äôs portfolio and assets. The Company will focus on its most profitable and higher margin SKUs, while continuing to further simplify its supply chain and rationalize SKUs across all brands and formats to help better position and optimize its products.

Sundial continues to work on research and development and a purposeful and robust innovation pipeline focused on inhalable products. Sundial launched two concentrates SKUs in the first quarter of 2021 and the Company implemented an approach targeted on the most profitable segments of its portfolio including Sundial‚Äôs new partnerships with Simply Solventless Concentrates Ltd. and Stigma Grow, in the development of additional concentrates offerings.

While continuing to focus on branded sales, Sundial has seen an increased sales trend in the wholesale market due to its focus on cultivation excellence and other licensed producers divesting from cultivation practices.

Sundial‚Äôs cultivation and production costs were reduced to an average of¬†$4 million¬†per month in the first quarter 2021 from¬†$10 million¬†per month in the first quarter of 2020 through efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives. Cultivation and production costs have stabilized through the first quarter of 2021.

Sundial‚Äôs facility in Olds amended its licence for standard processing authorizing the activity of sale for cannabis extract, cannabis topical and edible cannabis products, in addition to the previously granted licences for standard cultivation and for sale for medical purposes.

9931,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US.",ngrqqf,[],0
9934,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!",ngulnq,[],1
9935,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"So, I am ready to make a long term investment and I had this idea:

SpaceX will revolutionize how Humans interact with Space over the next 10-30 years. If this statement stands true, what companies other than SpaceX (because it is not publicly tradeable) will benefit heavily from this fact?

Rocket suppliers/material suppliers/someone in the supply chain etc. What does SpaceX need that someone else will provide (and is already positioned to do so) that could benefit heavily from SpaceX expanding it's business?

Any thoughts?",nguxep,[],0

9942,2021-05-20,wallstreetbets,"I believe GM stock is undervalued by half at least. Usually a company like GM should be trading at a multiple, instead they are trading for half the market cap of total earnings. Not saying this is the only factor but is definitely there. The EV vehicle transitions followed by announcements, release dates, increased earnings, new jobs all could be leading factors why GM stock reaches $90.

My plays are as follow: 

1. BUY GM OPTION $90 TARGET EXPIRATION JAN 2022 x 10 contracts
2. BUY GM OPTION $90 TARGET EXPIRATION JAN 2023 x 10 contracts

GM has the infastructure to support a massive takeover of EV, Tesla can barely deliver cars to people that ordered them 6 months ago. The market cap difference is $650 Billion. When GM siphons some of that market cap you can see GM stock trading anywhere from $150 to $300 making traders profits of anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million in profits. Check Options profit calculator for that option play and look at profit targets of $90 to $300. It will show what each option will be worth at each price level

$ASO went public back in October and has been steady climbing since then. Other sporting goods stores like $DKS are in the $80 per share price range. They have been around for decades, have a solid business model, and don‚Äôt price gouge in times of high demand.
