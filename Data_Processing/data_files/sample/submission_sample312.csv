14,2021-05-20,investing,"New Investor - Everything I've read says to buy a mutual fund with low expense ratios as the fees add up and you compound more money with lower fees. 

While I understand and agree with the previous statement, I am conflicted. When comparing a fund with a 0.015% expense ratio vs one with 0.7%, the fund with higher expense ratio comes out ahead when it out performs the lower expense ratio fund by 0.625%. 

When looking at Fidelity mutual funds it appears that most funds with a higher expense ratios out perform ones with lower expense ratios by significantly more than 0.625%. Examples:

&#x200B;

**Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX):** 

\-Expense ratio 0.015%, 1yr +45.97%, 5yr +23.41%, 10yr +14.16%

**Fidelity Select Software and IT Services Portfolio (FSCSX)**

\-Expense ratio 0.7%, 1yr +51.28%, 5yr +28.61%, 10yr +21.23%

&#x200B;

In this example, and in several higher expense ratio mutual funds I looked at, it appears beneficial to pay the higher expense ratio. I do know I'm not accounting for risk here but, being youngish, I am not too worried about it at this point. I also understand the 1 year growth is a bad marker of growth due to the COVID.

172,2021-05-10,investing,"Hi all,  


I've been a lurker and got some nice ideas form here, so thanks for that. Now it's the time for me to give something back. 

I discovered in the weekend that Magnachip is being bought up in a 29$ per share deal while the price of the stock is just 24$ per share. ([https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/](https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/))  


The deal has a definitive agreement and ""The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals"". Also ""The transaction is fully backed by equity commitments and not contingent on any financing conditions. ""  


The way I see it it's a 20% win in less than 6 months (they said second half of the year, so most probably will be sometime September-October-November). The risks are small:

Shareholders might oppose- but this is highly unlikely given the company is 78% own by institutions and the board of directors approves the deal.  
Regulatory things might kick in: this again I think it's low because we are talking about a 1 bil company, not something the size of ARM.

195,2021-05-10,investing,"Before we get into the juicy details, think for yourself: What are you shooting for? What is your financial goal? How risk-sensitive are you? Answering these questions will help to set you up for eventual success and develop your individual asset allocation strategy accordingly.

Let’s get to the facts: actively trading stocks, and timing market entries and exits come with inherent risks. Missing the best 10 days in the market between 2010 and 2020 would mean an overall decline of 33% (see [*Bank of America chart*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/this-chart-shows-why-investors-should-never-try-to-time-the-stock-market.html) below). Moreover, it is unlikely you sell your assets right before a crash and buy back at the bottom. In most cases, the worst days are followed by the best days which would put you back on square one holding your cash waiting for the crash.

### Strategies to Pick Stocks

Although stock-picking follows a more active approach, long-term investing means being active 1% of the time while leaving your portfolio alone for the other 99%. It is important to keep in mind that less than 10% of all public companies drive 100% of long-term stock-market returns. Therefore your mission is to find the 10% and patiently ride the wave.

Some hands-on advice:

* **Limited diversification**, as you cannot continuously research each company you are invested in on a regular basis. The range of 10-15 stocks is healthy, otherwise, go back to the previous section and consider passive investing.
* **Flexible & innovative companies** can adapt their business model and expand their market potential. The companies with today’s highest market caps all have this trait in common.
* **Don’t ignore what is familiar**, in 1966 Walt Disney was valued at $80 million and they just produced Mary Poppins turning over $30 million alone on that movie. The company was well-known and anyone could have picked up a few shares. $1000 invested back then would average you over $4 million today.
* **Know your strengths** and profit from them. If you are mathematically gifted then focus on the fundamentals. If you work in the industry and know the competitive landscape and product lineup, do that. Find your own style of investing.
* **Google is your friend**, look up the approval rate of the CEO on Glassdoor, read job reviews, check the company’s premises on Google street view and go on the investor relations site of the company. You need to do your own due diligence because nobody physically audits the business you invest in.
* **Leadership and the CEO** are decisive for the long-term success of a company. If the leader of a company is also its founder and owns lots of stock in it, the interests are aligned with the other shareholders and hence money is invested more efficiently.
* **Human** **resource management** such as low employee turnover, revenue per employee, diversity, inclusion, and so forth.
* **Deep dive into the company**: How does it create revenue? What is its market potential? Market growth versus the overall market potential of S&P500? What are the competitive advantages? Cashflow structure? Insider selling? Check on earnings calls, shareholder letters, and sweat the fundamentals a little bit.
* **Impact**: Does this company contribute to a better future?
* **Don’t overpay** because even great companies can be too expensive when too much of their future earnings potential is already priced in. Microsoft’s revenue was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999 and still, the stock had lost 50% of its value in that timeframe.
* **Avoid** owning a stock you can’t explain or you lack conviction in.
* **Double down** on companies that you are convinced are great investments for the long run even if you already own shares. If the business proves viable and returns are increasing, then it is likely to follow that trajectory in the near future.
* **Hold & wait**: trade as little as possible to avoid taxes and to enjoy the runups. The shorter you hold an asset the greater the chance that you have to close the position at a loss. The magic of compound interest will do the rest for you.
* **“Don’t lose money”** – Warren Buffett & treat every dollar as an investment.

I believe that beating the market is possible if you are patient and willing to invest time. After all, the business world is like a car race. In the last quarter of the race, it becomes more evident who might win, and your odds can be calculated with minimized risk exposure. Then you invest in the top-performing racers and still reap much of the benefits.

Keep in mind that most stocks underperform the market. The outsized gains of a few winners are pushing your portfolio higher and make up for any losses on the way.

## Cash

Oh, sweet cash sitting ducks in my account, what am I going to do with you? At current rates of around 1% (if even) it would take 70 years to double my money. By that time it is more likely that I am buried 6 feet underground. I wouldn't even get to experience my slim gains.

Yet there is some upside to holding a percentage of your overall portfolio in cash. Besides, you can’t pay your expenses off by handing out your stocks. Holding some cash is in both active and passive investing approaches detrimental. I advise holding approximately 5-15% of cash as it allows you to:

* Leave your portfolio in peace
* Remain calm during market volatility
* Jump in when prices are low and be opportunistic in the markets

Buying stocks in times of recession has historically brought about outsized gains for investors. It is worth remembering, the more it hurts holding some cash in market booms the more likely you will profit from a swift down-market. The best time to hold cash is when it really hurts to do so. Holding cash allows you to be prepared, and you don’t have to worry about timing the market.

* “I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” the chair and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said.
* Though he agreed with the early steps the Fed took during the pandemic, he said the policies have continued for too long.

Federal Reserve policies aimed at keeping markets and the economy afloat during the pandemic could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC on Tuesday.

The chairman and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said the Fed’s insistence on holding interest rates down and buying trillions in bonds even though markets are thriving and the economy is booming is a long-term risk.

“I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” Druckenmiller said during a”Squawk Box” interview.

Though he does not take issue with the Fed’s initial actions to combat the pandemic-related threats, Druckenmiller said the central bank has kept its foot on the accelerator too long.

He asserted that the Fed has continued its policies to help underwrite the spending binge in Congress, which has allocated more than $5 trillion in stimulus and is contemplating trillions more in infrastructure-related spending.

Over the long haul, he said, the policies and the heavy debts and deficits they support will threaten the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency. That status means the dollar is accepted for transactions and as a store of wealth anywhere and is widely held by central banks around the world.

“If they want to do all this and risk our reserve currency status, risk an asset bubble blowing up, so be it. But I think we ought to at least have a conversation about it,” Druckenmiller said.

“If we’re going to monetize our debt and we’re going to enable more and more of this spending, that’s why I’m worried now for the first time that within 15 years we lose reserve currency status and of course all the unbelievable benefits that have accrued with it,” he added.

To be sure, others have warned in the past that Fed excesses could threaten the dollar, but the greenback has retained its position in the world.

One reason for that is there have been no other viable alternatives introduced.

Druckemiller has entertained the thought that a challenge could come from the crypto world. He said in the CNBC interview that the ultimate solution could be “some kind of ledger system invented by some kids from MIT or Stanford” though he conceded that “I don’t know what it will be.”

However, he noted that in the early days of the pandemic, other foreign governments already voiced their concerns about the dollar by selling Treasurys, the opposite of what normally would happen in a crisis when ultra-safe U.S. debt is generally seen as a haven.

Indeed, foreign holdings of government bills, notes and bonds actually have decreased, falling by $127 billion or nearly 2% over the past year, according to Treasury Department data. Foreigners hold nearly one-third of the public portion of the $28.2 trillion U.S. debt.

Druckenmiller said central banks have been the root of a lack of confidence in dollar stability.

“The problem has been clearly identified. It’s [Fed Chair[ Jerome Powell and the rest of the world’s central bankers,” he said. “There’s a lack of trust.”

Druckenmiller’s comments came a day after he and Duquesne partner Christian Broda said in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal that Powell “needs to recognize the likelihood of future political pressures on the Fed and stop enabling financial and market excesses.”

Similarly, former New York Fed President William Dudley wrote in Bloomberg News that markets are underestimating how much the central bank will have to raise interest rates in the years ahead to keep up with the inflation it is trying to foster.

The Fed itself, in its semiannual Financial Stability Report last week, said it worried about risks coming from soaring asset prices.

Druckenmiller told CNBC he has “no doubt whatsoever that we are in a raging mania in all assets.”

**Keypath IPO is another Macquarie (Australian Investment Bank) listing and is only to being listed as a path for the private equity owners and key staff to cash out their shares. The IPO values the company at around USD800million yet shows no path to ever achieving profitability.  Beware.**

&#x200B;

Keypath IPO

Keypath Education is a US based education business that is soon to IPO in  Australia - not sure why they don't do it in the USA...

Keypath Education has been building its business since 2014 (7 years) and is  yet to turn a profit. Each year Keypath Education adds additional  programs (Masters) to drive additional student enrollments and revenue.  Additions of programs requires investment in learning design. The more  Keypath Education invests in learning design the greater its future  growth will be as this means new programs are being developed or  existing programs are being refreshed.

High overheads

Old  programs grow stale and over time drive lower revenue, so ever  increasing investment in programs is required to drive revenue growth  year on year.

The second part of  Keypath Education driving revenue growth is through marketing. Keypath  Education primarily drives student enrollments via online marketing  primarily Google and Facebook, but also a range of online sources.  Keypath Education is operating in a highly competitive market which  results in high marketing costs as a proportion of revenue. Higher  marketing spend drives higher enrollments which drives revenue. If  marketing spend is reduced enrollments reduce.

**Covid black swan to the rescue**

The  covid pandemic was a black swan event which saw a large portion of its  largest market (Australia) in lockdown for a good part of half a year  which the government paying people to not work and doubling welfare  payments to unemployed. This saw a large spike in enrollments over 2020  and 2021 as people turned to study to improve chances of re-entering the  workforce or to upskill while they were under lockdown.

Keypath’s  financial statements for the years 2020, 2019 and 2018 Statement of  Cash Flows shows increasing investment in its program offering  (Additions of amortizable assets), with investments increasing 50% over  the three years. Meanwhile existing programs also see increasing  depreciation as the investment in those programs depreciates in value.

However  the financial statements for the half year ended 31 December 2020 shows  something interesting. While revenues have increased substantially  (70%) marketing spend only increased 42%. This means the marketing spend  over the 6 months ended Dec 2020 was much more ""effective"" than that in  the six months ended Dec 2019. Additionally salaries and wages, which  reflect investment in people to generate sales and retain existing  students only grew 43% - in line with marketing.

What  this means is that Keypath Educations recent jump in revenue is not  sustainable and was only due to the Covid pandemic as people were left  with little to do but study.

What  this means is Keypath Education saw a windfall gain in enrollments due  to Covid without a resulting higher investment in either marketing or  staff to enroll those students. Keypath Education was converting  marketing spend at a rate far higher than in previous periods. This is  an abnormal situation and is unlikely to continue as people return to  work and life returns to normal.

**Diminishing investment in the business**

Further  Keypath Education's additions to amortizable intangible assets was  lower in the Dec 2020 half than in prior periods. This means Keypath  Education invested less in its business. As new courses see diminishing  enrollments as they mature this under investment in building and  maintaining courses will show itself over the coming years. If Keypath  Education isn’t building and maintaining its existing programs at ever  higher rates its revenue will eventually plateau then decline.

Keypath's  main revenue drivers is number of new students and its ability to  retain existing students. However if you read the offer documents both  of these drivers are completely absent, instead is hundreds of pages of  fluff about minimal investment in technology to market itself as a  ""tech"" business. It's nothing more than a sales and marketing arm of  universities. Definitely not a true tech business. The rest of the offer  document is fluff about diversity and how Keypath Education isn't just  like every other Online Program Management business in a very crowded  market.

What Keypath’s IPO  represents is a private equity firm that is desperate to exit a loss  making business that cannot turn a profit. The Covid epidemic saw a  windfall temporary increase in enrollments, which combined with reduced  investment in its product and reduced marketing and staff spend gives  the impression of a business about to turn a profit. This could not be  further from the truth.

**Recent jump in revenue not sustainable**

As  life returns to normal, the unemployment rates in Australia and the USA  are driven below 5% and 4% online education will become less appealing  and driving new enrollments will become much more competitive, requiring  substantially more investment in refreshing programs and higher  marketing and staff spend to convert leads to enrolments and retain them  in study.

Further Keypath  Education's Dec 2020 results are inflated by gains on currency  revaluation and movements in the AUD to the USD over the 6 months, this  adds approximately 1.5m to its bottom line, which in future periods  won't be recurring.

In their  attached financial statements Note 6 Amortization of intangibles (2020,  2019 and 2018 years). This note reflects that the amortization expense  on intangibles (namely, its course development) is forecast to decrease  substantially from 2021 through to 2025. If no future investment is made  this points to a downward investment in the future of the business in  order to drive short-term profitability and the share price at the  expense of the long-term growth of the business.

**Keypath Australia is running out of growth**

Keypath  Education has drawn a large portion of its growth from being one of the  first movers into the Australian market with which Keypath Education  found little competition. This allowed Keypath Education to add from  FY15 to FY18 three partners, then another three in FY 19. However this  slowed to two new partners and FY20 and in FY21 only one partner was  added. There is diminishing opportunities for Keypath to growth in  Australia with much of the low hanging fruit in terms of partners and  programs already developed.

**Future of exiting programs**

Page  70 of the prospectus illustrates the expiry of Keypath Education's  contracts. A full 74% of contracts will expire over the next six years.  Over this time university partners, boosted by Covid pushing their  programs online are going to find ways to reduce costs and learn how to  deliver successful online programs themselves.

There  is no guarantee these contracts once they expire will roll forward to  longer contracts and if they do, the universities are likely to demand  better terms once the industry is at maturity than they did in the  growth phase for OPM over the last six years. This is a major risk for  Keypath, as just as it is moving towards smaller losses it might find  its revenue streams dry up, with increased competition and lower margins  offered by its existing partners.

**Keypath in Canada and UK**

Keypath  Education's business in the UK and Canada has been a failure. Keypath  found the Canadian and UK markets not conductive to the type of rapid  growth a private equity business seeks in new markets. This has resulted  in little revenue growth in these markets and little prospect for  future growth.

**KeypathEdge fake ""eductech""**

Keypath  Education markets itself as an “edutech” business to boost its tech  credentials. However the fact is Keypath has little sophisticated  technology, much of its platforms are based on Microsoft platforms or  other purchased software used for course development. Keypath is not a  ‘tech’ business, it is more accurately described as a marketing and  sales business which is where the vast majority of its expenditure sits.  This is why it has high operating costs but relatively small  investments in technology.

**Another Macquarie Bank Pump and Dump**

Keypath  Education is highly over valued based on its proposed offer price. This  will be a float like Macquarie Bank's other recent famous IPO Nuix  which was tainted by inflated numbers, fraud and has tanked and will be  very unlikely to return to its IPO 'valuation'.

Keypath  has no path to profit, requires massive investment just to keep pumping  out new courses and due to the intense competition in the industry must  spend a massive proportion of its revenues on marketing and staff to  keep students from dropping out after finding the online learning  experience less than satisfactory.

760,2021-05-20,investing,"So, I posted a topic about me thinking of using my equity to buy a property, but this is a different question. Im just trying to find, after doing research, why do people consider this even a good idea.  
Im hoping this is the correct area to post this, but im trying to determine why would people touch their equity to buy another home when you have also have to pay that equity back during a long term investment?  


Reason I ask is, I am trying to see how this is even a benefit when usually equity plus the new mortgage price is still higher than the average price around town. I can understand 20% of your own money because you dont pay that back and it sits as an investment in a home, but equity, I am having a hard time seeing how this even clears rent + equity return. 

&#x200B;

example, im looking into cape coral (would like to be a future investment when I retire) with 20% down its about 900 a month but to rent it out in that area specifically is about 1400. so with equity and mortgage, its about that price and possibly more. SO how can possibly pulling equity for an investment be good for investments?",ngyccv,[],1

893,2021-05-10,investing,"Before we get into the juicy details, think for yourself: What are you shooting for? What is your financial goal? How risk-sensitive are you? Answering these questions will help to set you up for eventual success and develop your individual asset allocation strategy accordingly.

Let’s get to the facts: actively trading stocks, and timing market entries and exits come with inherent risks. Missing the best 10 days in the market between 2010 and 2020 would mean an overall decline of 33% (see [*Bank of America chart*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/this-chart-shows-why-investors-should-never-try-to-time-the-stock-market.html) below). Moreover, it is unlikely you sell your assets right before a crash and buy back at the bottom. In most cases, the worst days are followed by the best days which would put you back on square one holding your cash waiting for the crash.

### Strategies to Pick Stocks

Although stock-picking follows a more active approach, long-term investing means being active 1% of the time while leaving your portfolio alone for the other 99%. It is important to keep in mind that less than 10% of all public companies drive 100% of long-term stock-market returns. Therefore your mission is to find the 10% and patiently ride the wave.

Some hands-on advice:

* **Limited diversification**, as you cannot continuously research each company you are invested in on a regular basis. The range of 10-15 stocks is healthy, otherwise, go back to the previous section and consider passive investing.
* **Flexible & innovative companies** can adapt their business model and expand their market potential. The companies with today’s highest market caps all have this trait in common.
* **Don’t ignore what is familiar**, in 1966 Walt Disney was valued at $80 million and they just produced Mary Poppins turning over $30 million alone on that movie. The company was well-known and anyone could have picked up a few shares. $1000 invested back then would average you over $4 million today.
* **Know your strengths** and profit from them. If you are mathematically gifted then focus on the fundamentals. If you work in the industry and know the competitive landscape and product lineup, do that. Find your own style of investing.
* **Google is your friend**, look up the approval rate of the CEO on Glassdoor, read job reviews, check the company’s premises on Google street view and go on the investor relations site of the company. You need to do your own due diligence because nobody physically audits the business you invest in.
* **Leadership and the CEO** are decisive for the long-term success of a company. If the leader of a company is also its founder and owns lots of stock in it, the interests are aligned with the other shareholders and hence money is invested more efficiently.
* **Human** **resource management** such as low employee turnover, revenue per employee, diversity, inclusion, and so forth.
* **Deep dive into the company**: How does it create revenue? What is its market potential? Market growth versus the overall market potential of S&P500? What are the competitive advantages? Cashflow structure? Insider selling? Check on earnings calls, shareholder letters, and sweat the fundamentals a little bit.
* **Impact**: Does this company contribute to a better future?
* **Don’t overpay** because even great companies can be too expensive when too much of their future earnings potential is already priced in. Microsoft’s revenue was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999 and still, the stock had lost 50% of its value in that timeframe.
* **Avoid** owning a stock you can’t explain or you lack conviction in.
* **Double down** on companies that you are convinced are great investments for the long run even if you already own shares. If the business proves viable and returns are increasing, then it is likely to follow that trajectory in the near future.
* **Hold & wait**: trade as little as possible to avoid taxes and to enjoy the runups. The shorter you hold an asset the greater the chance that you have to close the position at a loss. The magic of compound interest will do the rest for you.
* **“Don’t lose money”** – Warren Buffett & treat every dollar as an investment.

I believe that beating the market is possible if you are patient and willing to invest time. After all, the business world is like a car race. In the last quarter of the race, it becomes more evident who might win, and your odds can be calculated with minimized risk exposure. Then you invest in the top-performing racers and still reap much of the benefits.

Keep in mind that most stocks underperform the market. The outsized gains of a few winners are pushing your portfolio higher and make up for any losses on the way.

## Cash

Oh, sweet cash sitting ducks in my account, what am I going to do with you? At current rates of around 1% (if even) it would take 70 years to double my money. By that time it is more likely that I am buried 6 feet underground. I wouldn't even get to experience my slim gains.

Yet there is some upside to holding a percentage of your overall portfolio in cash. Besides, you can’t pay your expenses off by handing out your stocks. Holding some cash is in both active and passive investing approaches detrimental. I advise holding approximately 5-15% of cash as it allows you to:

* Leave your portfolio in peace
* Remain calm during market volatility
* Jump in when prices are low and be opportunistic in the markets

Buying stocks in times of recession has historically brought about outsized gains for investors. It is worth remembering, the more it hurts holding some cash in market booms the more likely you will profit from a swift down-market. The best time to hold cash is when it really hurts to do so. Holding cash allows you to be prepared, and you don’t have to worry about timing the market.

I've been a lurker and got some nice ideas form here, so thanks for that. Now it's the time for me to give something back. 

I discovered in the weekend that Magnachip is being bought up in a 29$ per share deal while the price of the stock is just 24$ per share. ([https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/](https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/))  


The deal has a definitive agreement and ""The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals"". Also ""The transaction is fully backed by equity commitments and not contingent on any financing conditions. ""  


The way I see it it's a 20% win in less than 6 months (they said second half of the year, so most probably will be sometime September-October-November). The risks are small:

Shareholders might oppose- but this is highly unlikely given the company is 78% own by institutions and the board of directors approves the deal.  
Regulatory things might kick in: this again I think it's low because we are talking about a 1 bil company, not something the size of ARM.

915,2021-05-20,investing,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Wednesday its investment institute is planning to evaluate and onboard an actively managed cryptocurrency strategy for its wealthy clients, the latest move by a major U.S. bank toward accepting digital currencies.

In a report titled “The investment rationale for cryptocurrencies”, the Wells Fargo Investment Institute (WFII) said it views digital assets as an alternative investment for qualified investors through a professionally managed fund.

""WFII believes that cryptocurrencies have gained stability and viability as assets, but the risks lead us to favor investment exposure only for qualified investors, and even then through professionally managed funds,"" it said. (bit.ly/33Xu07i)

Goldman Sachs Group Inc moved to allow Wall Street investors to trade with a derivative tied to bitcoin prices, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month.

Bitcoin has been gaining mainstream acceptance in recent months. Morgan Stanley in March became the first big U.S. bank to offer its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds, according to a CNBC report.

JPMorgan Chase & Co is also preparing to let certain clients invest in an actively managed bitcoin fund for the first time, CoinDesk reported in April. (bit.ly/3v1cyKJ)

Bank of NY Mellon Corp in February formed a new unit to help clients hold, transfer and issue digital assets.

Bitcoin and ethereum posted their largest one-day percentage drop since March last year on Wednesday, after China banned financial and payment institutions from providing cryptocurrency services.

Drone Delivery Canada Corp. (TSXV: FLT; OTC QX: TAKOF; Frankfurt:  A2AMGZ or ABB.F) (the “Company” or “DDC”) is pleased to announce that, with the assistance of its sales agent Air Canada  (TSX: AC), it has been selected by the University of British Columbia (“UBC”) to deploy DDC’s patented drone delivery solution at the Stellat’en First Nation, for UBC’s “Remote Communities Drone Transport Initiative” program.

 

The project will enable defined-route deliveries utilizing DDC’s Sparrow drone and its DroneSpot® takeoff and landing zones as well as additional drone flight infrastructure as required.  The solution will be used to transport a variety of cargo for the benefit of the Stellat’en First Nation, located in the Fraser Lake area of Central Northern British Columbia, Canada.

 

DDC and UBC will work towards finalizing a definitive agreement shortly.  DDC is expected to commence deployment of site infrastructure summer of 2021 and expects to begin providing drone delivery services under the agreement in the second half of 2021. The drone project term is expected to be 12 months. This deployment will be DDC’s fourth First Nations project and its first in British Columbia.

 

All operations will be conducted in accordance with appropriate Canadian regulations. Flights will be remotely monitored by DDC from its Operations Control Centre located in Vaughan, Ontario.

 

“We look forward to working with Drone Delivery Canada and all partners on this project for the benefit of the Stellat’en First Nation.  Many First Nations communities in B.C. are on lockdown to reduce transmission of COVID-19, which has exacerbated inequitable access to health care supplies and services, ranging from personal protective equipment and medications to laboratory services such as COVID-19 testing and diagnostics for other medical conditions,” said Dr. Michael Allard, Vice-Dean, Health Engagement & Partnerships, UBC.

 

“Based on the isolated location of our community and the needs of our residents, drone transport may enhance our access to COVID-19 testing and medication without traveling and endangering other members of our community,” said Chief Robert Michell of the Stellat’en First Nation, located about 100 kilometres west of Prince George. “The futuristic potential of this initiative is exciting. With drone technology, there is so much you can do.”

 

“We are pleased that UBC has chosen Drone Delivery Canada as part of their ‘Remote Communities Drone Transportation Initiative’ at the Stellat’en First Nation. The UBC Faculty of Medicine is a recognized global leader and we applaud their initiative to embrace drone delivery to benefit First Nations communities. As an award-winning global leader, DDC is pleased with our continued business successes in the drone delivery industry,” said Michael Zahra, President & CEO of DDC.",nh1ol9,[],1
