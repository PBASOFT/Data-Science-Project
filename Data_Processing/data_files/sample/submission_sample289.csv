>$GVSI update. The company's arrears with the Transfer Agent have now been paid in full as we move forward.

That's certainly good news for $GVSI. But this is something which GS could control the timing of; he could have paid the TA tomorrow or in a week from now ‚Äì there's really no rush. But in a few hours GS has a hearing to convince a judge that $RETC is better off in his hands. Showing that he's responsible with another custodianship will only help his case in today's hearing.

Was the timing intentional? Perhaps we'll never know. But what are the chances that his handling of the $GVSI transfer agent issue will be mentioned in support of his case in the $RETC hearing?",nfjs1f,[],0

(‚Äú**Digihost**‚Äù or the ‚Äú**Company**‚Äù) (TSXV: DGHI; OTCQB: HSSHF) is pleased to report that over 90% of the energy consumed by the Company in its Bitcoin (‚Äú**BTC**‚Äù) mining operations is from sources that create zero carbon emissions and more than 50% of the energy consumed by the Company is generated from renewable resources.  


The following table provides a breakdown of the sources of energy consumed by Digihost in its BTC mining operations in 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/yvz85nzvnyz61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9701f3f572d23940e3271369fa5a995d4b2f0ac

A cornerstone of Digihost‚Äôs business strategy is to continue to mine BTC in an efficient and environmentally conscious manner, thereby minimizing the Company‚Äôs carbon footprint. Digihost will assess a number of alternatives including the purchase of carbon credits to reduce its already low carbon footprint. The Company‚Äôs long-term plans for growth include vertical integration of power production from low-cost, clean and renewable sources of energy. On March 24, 2021, the Company announced the acquisition of a 60MW power plant for which it intends, to the extent possible, to source and utilize renewable natural gas and also engage in the practice of acquiring renewable energy certificates, all in line with the Company‚Äôs objective to reduce and mitigate its carbon footprint.

Michel Amar, the Company‚Äôs CEO, stated: ‚ÄúWe are extremely proud to report that over 90% of the energy consumed by Digihost is from sources producing zero carbon emissions, and that over 50% is from renewable sources of energy, making Digihost one of the cleanest green Bitcoin mining operations in the United States. As a Company, we have always been cognizant of the potential impact Bitcoin mining could have on the environment and therefore have planned our growth and expansion to be environmentally conscious, in our pursuit of opportunities that maximize value for our shareholders.‚Äù

Lithium producers. SQM , MALRF, ALB.  ERPNF

Lithium Development. CYDVF, LI, LIACF, LAC, SPMTF. (Ones I know... Search out more.)

Lithium Exploration - SNNAF, QMC.v, PE.v, SLL.v, BKPTF. (All Canadian companies. There are lots in all countries so look where you are...)

Cobalt Development - EQN.to, FCO.to, CCO.to,

Nickle Producers - RTP, NILSY, S.to, FM.to,

Nickle Development - GMC.to, NI.to, ASN.v,

Nickle Exploration - HNC.to, DM.to, GSS.v, TLOFF (Note... Cobalt is found with Nickle and silver. Cobalt companies would go here too...)

Copper Producers - RIO, FCX, SCCO, FM.to, LUN.to

Copper Development - TRQ.to, SCCO, ERO.to. CMMC.to

Copper Exploration - SURG.v, APN.v, CN.v, WCC.v, OCO.v.

Neodymium - This one search rare earth companies. I don't know enough about these to post a breakdown of producer/developer/explorer but these companies are in the sector. - MP, NEO.to, LEM.v, UCU.v

Iron Producers - RIO, VALE, BHP, FSUGY,  NMDC

Iron Development - (Just kidding.... I don't know any companies exploring or developing for Iron... buy the producers...)

For transparency, I have shares in the following companies and have posted on most of them before. SPMT.cn/SPMTF, CYP.V/CYDVF, BKPTF/CRUZ.cse, SNNAF/SIE.v, S.to, ALB,  DM.to, RIO , LI, and PE.v.

For why I picked these ones to own, SPMTF just completed a drilling program and has a deposit, they are directly beside CYDVF who is beside ALB. CYDVF also has a deposit and ALB is the only producer of lithium in North America. So it is an area play. In the area as well is BKPTF, PE.v and SNNAF. PE.v is currently drilling lithium brine and the other two are directly beside them. If one hits they all hit and they are really cheap ATM. S.to and BKPTF have Cobalt and will run on that alone but both also have other resources that is not as obvious including Nickle, Silver and others. DM.to will move with nickle and RIO is a huge produces of several of these commodities. I think that covers it. Bar non, CRUZ/BKPTF is my easiest trade as I think it will double in a few weeks.

The project covers the historic mining area and  swarms of similar veins that extend for at least three kilometres along  strike. To understand this specific area and this deposit it is good to know that it is an orogenic formation with a folded nose type of deposit. These are created when the the earth was forming and the plates were converging creating a subduction zone and an area that was being up-thrust and rolled in to a tight layered formation. This type of formation has been responsible for many of the significant deposits located around the world.

973,2021-05-19,pennystocks,"New rules will affect your ability to buy and sell ‚ÄúPink No Information‚Äù securities, including at E*TRADE 

On September 28, 2021, new requirements take effect that will impact the market for‚Äîand value of‚Äîcertain ‚Äúover-the-counter (OTC) securities‚Äù you currently hold or have held in the past. The new rules apply to ‚ÄúPink No Information‚Äù OTC securities of companies that fail to publicly report and keep current financial and other company information and will restrict the ability of U.S. brokers, like E*TRADE from making these products generally available. 

Some background on the new requirements 

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently adopted amendments to SEC Rule 15c2-11 governing the submission and publication of OTC quotations. These amendments will prohibit broker-dealers from submitting or publicly disseminating bid/ask quotations for OTC securities of issuers that do not meet enhanced information filing requirements. 

Securities of issuers that make the required information publicly available by the deadline in the rule should not be affected. 

What these changes mean for you 

Starting September 28, 2021, you will no longer be able to buy or sell ‚ÄúPink No Information‚Äù OTC securities through E*TRADE. Other restrictions related to the purchase of these securities may apply sooner. Please keep in mind that the upcoming changes will negatively affect the value of any ‚ÄúPink No Information‚Äù OTC securities you hold now or in the future. 

Have you guys seen this for those who buy OTC on E*TRADE? What do I do with my pennies on E*TRADE?",ng90be,[],0
989,2021-05-19,pennystocks,"I‚Äôve been going through news about PPE & publicly traded PPE companies like DuPont (DD), 3M (MMM), Owens & Minor (OMI), and Optec but I did some research on $OPTI.

Current Value(11:30am today) $.061

OPTEC has products like UV cleaning lights and fuel maximizers for commercial transportation but it seems like they‚Äôre looking to expand their PPE services. I saw on Yahoo that OPTEC entered into an Exclusive Distribution Agreement with Rafina Innovations Inc. - a Medical and Pharmaceutical development company with offices in Glasgow and Athens. Per the press release, the agreement gives Rafina an exclusive right to distribute OPTEC products.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rafina-innovations-inc-announces-brand-123700237.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rafina-innovations-inc-announces-brand-123700237.html)

OPTEC CEO says:

‚ÄúWe are very happy to have Rafina as an exclusive distributor for the Cyprus territory to expand our product lines to this medical/pharmaceutical region and particularly in the Ocean-Going Vessel Shipping sectors. We look forward to further expanding our cooperation with Rafina in this region.‚Äù

It reads to me like OPTEC is working to tap into the commercial trading sector with more than their fuel maximizer, perhaps leveraging existing relationships to sell PPE? Either way, it's interesting to see the company looking to expand distribution in the Mediterranean, and especially in the ocean-going shipping industry. We all saw what happened to cruise ships early on in the Pandemic. Shipping looks like an industry that will maintain strict PPE requirements because they have much to lose if an outbreak occurred on a vessel at sea. I‚Äôm curious to see updates from this partnership down the road. 

Another PPE partnership to note is OPTEC‚Äôs acquisition of PPE supplier WeShield. I‚Äôve seen the acquisition talked about a bit on other threads and I‚Äôm happy to see another PPE related update from OPTEC. I assume the company is likely strategizing how best to work in the PPE space as the nation is entering into the recovery phase from COVID. I think my next research project will be maritime COVID safety and what that market looks like.",ng9cj1,[],1
