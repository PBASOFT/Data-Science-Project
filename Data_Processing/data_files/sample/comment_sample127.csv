0,gzrep9r,2021-05-28,t3_nmy8ts,investing,"yeah an ETF is just an instrument so your statements above don't really convey much meaning...

Assuming you're talking about passive, broad market index, cap-weighted ETFs, they do have some advantages over a traditional bottom-up, stock picking fund (say something that holds 40-60 stocks) in that they 1. often have lower management fees, 2. cap weighting is an in-built price momentum mechanism (outperforming stocks end up with higher weights, underperformers will organically have lower weights over time) - people like to argue whether this feature is a pro or a con, I can see both sides of the argument but as a default I think its pros outweigh cons, 3. breadth of holdings and asymmetric distribution of equity returns means you can potentially have exposure to big winners.

As to what ETF to buy... that's your own preference since every asset class or category will go through its own cycle in its own time. I personally prefer those that are tied to broad indices/categories with a good spread of sectors and/or countries where relevant.",[],0

19,gzrgz6h,2021-05-28,t3_nmvuhl,investing,"I think this is an interesting idea, but ultimately the logic is backwards on a lot of this. What it really does is make short-term investing tax-equal to long term investing.

To go through the problems this “could solve”:
1) While a lack of capital gains taxes if you reinvest could make it marginally more worthwhile to sell a company that changes course, the market itself incentivizes that. If you expect the value to go down long term, sell! You’re only paying taxes on the gain, not the principle, regardless of the tax structure.

2) I’m less sure tax loss harvesting is something to discourage. Regardless, if we want to discourage it, let’s just eliminate the loss deduction.

3) Not at all — it would give long-term investors more flexibility, but it also gives day traders even greater incentive to day trade. The key factor that makes a 401k encourage long-term investing is not the tax-sheltering effect, but the tax-sheltering *if you leave the money until you’re retirement age.*

4) I’m not a CBO scorer, so not going to say it won’t create higher revenues, but even if it does cause higher revenues by pumping the market higher… what value is created? We all know stock prices are often disconnected from real value of firms, but tax policy shouldn’t encourage greater disconnects even if that disconnect grows revenues. A frothy market creates wider economic instability.

5) I agree with you that inequitable taxation of capital (lower rates) and labor (higher rates) drives inequality. I have no idea how taxing capital gains *less* than they already are would rectify this imbalance.

TL;DR: Currently if you invest long-term you pay a certain rate. This tax policy would give day traders the same rate. This would, at best, fail to change incentives for long term v short term investing, and probably increase incentives to invest short term.",[],0
20,gzrh0ce,2021-05-28,t1_gzr8b3s,investing,"P/E is a relative ratio  of Price to Earnings.  Historically, the LT average P/E for the S&P500 has been \~15x.  So - over generalizing - using that number, you can roughly tell whether a stock is selling above average or below average.  One common way to determine the average P/E for an industry is to look at the P/E of multiple members of that industry and compare that to the P/E of the stock (company) that you are interested in.  Caveat: Beware of the market cycle as - like today - we are very likely near the top of the business cycle and many stocks are selling at inflated P/E's.  (At least to my observation.)  

Another way to look at P/E is to ""Flip it Over"" and calculate the E/P (Earnings to Price).  What does E/P tell you?  It tells you what percentage return (per share) that the company is generating. 

Examples:

If a company's stock is selling at $15.00/share and the company is generating an EPS of $1.00/share...

P/E = (15/1) = the stock is selling at 15X earnings.

E/P = (1/15) = the company is generating a 6.67% return on your $15 share investment

...If you are seeking a ROI of 15% at your point of investment, you must look for a stock selling for \~$6.50/share

E/P = (1/6.50) = a company generating 15.4% ROI at your cost basis.

Hope this helps you to understand P/E better?  Good Luck!",[],0

28,gzrhyj7,2021-05-28,t3_nmtl1k,investing,"I have a question regarding ITM options vs buying the stock outright..   


I just purchased some PLTR stock and I plan to hold this for 8-10 years or more.  
I'm slowly adding to and increasing my position.  
I purchased around $1500 worth of the stock today @ 23.31, my other purchases were around $18-19/share.  
  
I understand options for the most part and I'm familiar with selling cash covered puts and selling covered calls, as well as the risk/reward of purchasing calls and puts. However... one thing I can't seem to grasp is ITM options. I think my brain goes haywire and I can't grasp it.. which brings me to my two questions;  
  
Since I intend to hold PLTR for the long term and don't mind the day to day or even month to month price fluctuations... would it make ANY sense to purchase lets say.. an ITM CALL that's going for $13.20 per contract with a strike price of $11 (expiring JUNE) VS purchasing the stock outright? With how I understand ITM options, I could purchase that ITM call expiring a few weeks from now, and exercise it immediately to own the 100 shares. and instead of paying $1500 for lets say 60 shares right now.  
Because if I purchase the ITM call and exercise the option, I'll have 100 shares for roughly $1320 vs purchasing the stock now for $1500 and getting only 60 shares. Am I getting this correct?  
  
And my final question... as far as SELLING ITM options, whether it's calls or puts, how does this work?  
If I own 100 shares of a stock that's trading at $20, I know I can sell 1 covered call contract expiring on whatever date with a strike price of my choosing (20.50, 21, 22, 25, etc...) BUT what happens if I change my strike price to be ITM, let's say $10? The premium I get is higher, but I need to understand what the catch is.

Absolutely not, you will have to pay for the shares at the strike price as well. $1320 in premium + $1100 for 100 shares at the strike = $2420. If ever find free money it means you are overlooking something. 

>BUT what happens if I change my strike price to be ITM, let's say $10? The premium I get is higher, but I need to understand what the catch is.

When you sell ITM covered calls the catch is that the counterparty can exercise them.

191,gzrxuhl,2021-05-28,t1_gzrbhr8,investing,"My perspective on LETFs is the same as all investments: 

\- All assessments of returns must be risk-adjusted (article one shows negative alpha and lower Sharpe ratios) 

\- The appetite for risk is a decision of the investor 

\- It is the burden of one making the case for an investment to provide the evidence that the investment is good e.g., if I say you have a wooden horse up your ass, and it'd be unreasonable for me to follow-up and say ""you can't prove you don't have a wooden horse up your ass!"" as you are doing now. 

It is absolutely disingenuous and deceitful how misquote your own links after accusing me of cherry-picking. This is the full sentence which you intentionally omitted ""But due to the serial correlation and the relatively small size of the drag the effect on the returns is **small compared to the fees"".** You have a small penis vs. you have a small penis compared to that of a horse - you see the difference?  

All the graphs you are looking at don't count ETF fees. I am not doubting the gross returns on a 2X ETF are higher when you don't count the cost of using the ETF. Why is this so hard for you to grasp? 

The author has one plot with fees and arrives at the following conclusion ""The return of the leverage = 2 ETF has been reduced to that of a fee-free leverage = 1 ETF. So all the benefits of leveraging have been lost."". 

It is certainly possible to cherry pick time periods and to arrive at different conclusions, as is possible with all investments. In the same vein, TQQQ has wildly outperformed QQQ for the last decade. If that was sufficient evidence of a quality investment, people wouldn't be asking the question. 

There is a role for LETFs on a short-term basis. On a long-term basis, you have to accept:

\- Overall returns that are similar to regular ETFs once you account for fees (with the answer varying depending on time period selected) 

\- A worse risk-adjusted return, which indicates you may be better off with a portfolio of high beta equities 

\- Tracking error that worsens with higher volatility, even if not large compared to fees today 

\- The belief that volatility will remain low, returns will continue at the current rates, and no black swan event during your lifetime every wipes out more than 30% of the market at once",[],0

The mill coin was worth a tenth of a penny, and was issued by some state and local governments, but it hasn't been issued since the 1960's, when it became obvious that the money was worth so little that dividing a penny was pointless. Looking at the period from 1914 to today, the government has a bad history of distributing newly printing money, as it tends to give the money to its donors, or rich clients of banks through low interest loans, or handouts to constituents through what are now called 'stimmy checks', but all of these methods are highly unfair, capricious, and clearly chosen for political gain, depending on which party is in office. Its pretty clear that government shouldn't be in charge of money creation, because its so unjust in the way it operates. Now we really had no option in the past, since a 'trusted' third party was needed to oversee the creation process. Since the invention of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, its becoming more and more obvious that there are MUCH fairer ways to create and distribute new money, and maybe the time for a separation of money and state has arrived, as clearly the current system is highly unjust, and is pretty much driving massive wealth inequality in things like housing, where those without access to cheap loans have really no chance to ever own a home at these prices.

One of my favorite stocks in my portfolio is Waste Management ($WM). There are few things in life more certain than the fact that people are going to make a lot of garbage, continuously, for the foreseeable future. They even pay a dividend that's pretty respectable for a company that doesn't sell oil, gas, or pharmaceuticals (current yield is 1.64%). I keep a good chunk of my portfolio in $WM because I feel confident that it will go up, but not because I expect it to wildly outperform the marketing.

Self-driving cars are probably going to explode, making chips and AI and other related components a good bet. 5G is also likely to take off, and there are a bunch of infrastructure stocks related to that as well, ranging from companies that make 5G technology to realtors that lease their land holdings for 5G antennas. 

Of course, the tricky thing with these sectors is there are a lot of players and not all of them are going to be winners. A few will end up being wildly successful and the others will be left behind, like Alta-Vista and Yahoo were left behind by Google. To best ensure that you end up with a Google in your holdings and not a portfolio full of Alta-Vista, you need to buy into a LOT of companies, or an industry-focused ETF.

PAWZ is a pet care industry ETF with good historical performance that I like. There's been a steady increase for years now in the amount of money people are willing to spend on their pets, from fancy expensive foods to luxury boarding to genetic testing and other advanced medical care that people never used to consider. If people remain prosperous that trend is likely to continue growing, but it's less of a sure thing - it could start seeing a steady decline if the economy sours, because indulging your pet is the kind of expense people cut back on when budgets get tight. That makes its future success uncertain, but I still think it has a limited risk of loss because any decline will be gradual - it won't tank overnight because people don't just stop spending money on their pets cold turkey.",['AI'],1

It contains non marketable securities that are something like Treasury bonds, except they pay more interest than real treasuries.

If I write you a check for a good or service and give it to you, until you cash it, that check is an asset to you and a liability to me. Now suppose instead I want to reward myself, so I write myself a check and put it in my back pocket. Now is that check an asset to myself or a liability ? The answer is neither, its just a piece of paper, because its all my money, whether its in my front pocket, or my back pocket. Of course the US government is broke, because it spends WAY more money than it collects in taxes every year, so writing itself a check and putting it in a 'trust fund' is just a paper shuffling exercise, because that check can only be 'cashed', if the government gets some fresh tax money from somewhere. There is no savings, there is no trust fund, its just an accounting fiction, all the tax collected in the past for future Social Security obligations was spent as it was collected, leaving the cupboard bare, and guess what ? Now we need to pay more in SS benefits than the payroll tax brings in, but WHERE is that new tax revenue going to come from to make good on those government checks to itself ? I don't know.",[],0

I only sell a little bit because the reason a company becomes 15%+ of a portfolio is because it's doing very, very well, so I usually want to stay invested to keep gaining more. Candidly, I think this is partly me managing risk but also partly me looking for an excuse to put a locked-in gain on the scoreboard. Generally speaking I regard my portfolios as a long-term investment, and my bias is against cashing out, because time in the market is such a powerful wealth multiplier that it seems short-sighted to cash out and enjoy a temporary bit of cash when I could wait and reap a bigger reward later.

The difference with a private account invested in real productive companies is plainly obvious, in that there are actual assets in the account to pay benefits. The only way Social Security benefits can be paid is if the printer go B\_R\_R\_R\_R, because there are WAY less taxes coming in than there are bills going out, and that is not likely to change much, even with tax increases, because the US government's obligations are so huge. This is why private accounts are needed, it has nothing to do with an individual running out of money, the government is ALREADY out of money, and guess what ? Those chickens are coming home to roost, and it isn't going to be pretty.

Its easy enough to buy an annuity with a retirement account, to guaranty income, but no transaction is without risks. The best way to run a retirement account is to save enough assets that the account will not be depleted in a person's lifetime. This might mean more savings than the current 15 % SS tax, but if the account were actually owned by the recipient, and could be passed down as an inheritance, it would be a lot better than the alternative, which is to trust corrupt politicians when they say 'no problem, bro, we will get the money, I don't know where from, but what is the worst that could happen ?'

One thing that's helpful to know if you're writing puts - while of course you should always be prepared to be assigned - early assignment is not super likely very early in the contract period unless the company is very publicly going down in flames. There's no financial advantage to exercising in month 3 vs exercising in month 15, other than someone who desperately needs to sell off assets to raise cash - a possibility but not a high frequency one. I've held onto puts even when the stock price fell below my strike price because there was so much time left on the contract and the market buzz was more like ""this stock was becoming overvalued too quickly, but still has promising outlook post-price-correction"" vs ""this stock is poison,"" because I felt reasonably certain that early assignment was unlikely, and the price did recover before the end of the contract.",[],1

I've heard that in selecting a portfolio, it's best to find assets that have (historically) weak/negative price correlation. The problem I've run up against is that, when the market dumps, everything seems to dump together - in other words, assets that didn't seem correlated or were inversely correlated sometimes become strongly correlated when the market is doing poorly, thus sort of defeating some of the protective intent of diversify through non-correlated assets.  
  
According to your experience, is there any way around this, statistically speaking? Are there different correlation tests that you've found to be more effective for diversification? Is it perhaps best to invest in newer assets in price discovery mode, or to invest broadly by small amounts in any assets that have been least affected by market-wide downturns in the past? Any advice would be appreciated. I'm writing this mostly because of the recent crypto downturn, but I imagine strategies would transfer approximately between crypto and more traditional assets.",[],0

375,gzsdq6h,2021-05-28,t1_gzrpo5d,investing,"One thing to pay attention to that can impact the DY% calculation is big moves in the stock price, because yield is always calculated based on the price of the stock at the beginning of the year.

EX: A stock is priced at $100/share at the beginning of the year and the issues a $4 annual dividend. The yield for that year is 4% no matter what happens to the stock price later in the year. If the price drops to $50 by the end of the year, are they still going to pay 4%, or is it a sign that they're in trouble and might reduce or skip issuing a dividend? Similarly, if the price goes up to $200, are they still going to pay 4% next year, or did the P/E ratio skyrocket as the price rose, and they don't feel like they can afford to double $ value of the dividend just to maintain a 4% yield, so they pay the same $4 next year and that year ends up being a 2% yield year.

A related thing to look for is the consistency of the dividends - do they always pay one, or do they stop paying out in down years, and how often do they have down years? Have they ever increased the dividend %? Have they ever decreased it?

Google ""Dividend Aristocrats"" which is a list of companies that have consistently increased or held steady their dividend yield % for 20+ years. There are few few stocks on the list - I don't remember off the top of my head but it's like, 45 or so. Those companies are probably good bets for future dividends being similar to current ones - not only because they've demonstrated stability, but also because there's a prestige to earning a spot on the DA list and it takes a long time to get back on it if a company falls off, so they'll feel pressure to maintain dividends even in down years.",[],0

So, you’re not realistically going to make monthly income that you can use out of that 1500 in your account right now, but if you’re disciplined you can use that 1500 to learn the process, see what style of trading or investing works for you, and achieve consistent results. When you’ve achieved consistent results Over the course of a year or two, you can have the confidence to invest larger amounts of money and achieve your goal of  earning a bit of side money with a limited amount of time commitment.

Generally speaking, if you want to get a 10-bagger or more, you have to accept the risk of a high PE, because you get 10-baggers by investing in companies that are still young and small and hoping they live long enough to succeed and grow, and it's very common for these companies to report $0 or negative earnings for several years. Some because they're already profitable but they're borrowing heavily to invest in their future growth, and some because they aren't yet profitable and are subsisting on venture capital while they try to build the market dominance their business model needs in order to be profitable. 

I tend to be more wary of the latter type of high PE start-up than the former kind. Leveraging debt to invest in itself is a very normal/common practice among successful companies not least because reporting $0 or negative earnings is a great way to reduce your tax burden, and because money now is worth more than money later, and if you have a proven profitable business model and a reasonable expectation that investment will drive growth, it's a no-brainer. This is doubly or triply true when interest rates are in the gutter and money can be bought cheaply. Start-ups surviving on venture capital is another story... sometimes they work out, so it's not a totally illegitimate way to grow, but more often it's just Silicon Valley dudes with more money than brains gambling on bad idea and they lose their investment. 

So high PE is not necessarily unexpected when I'm interested in a young company, but it's a flag that I need to put in more due diligence to figure out what kind of company this is and how it operates than say, $ALLY, which currently has a P/E just under 10. I'm an Ally customer and generally believe they offer a good product and don't seem to be shady, so I don't really feel like I need to pore over the balance sheet to feel good about investing in them.

I have no idea what this means. Getting exposure to an index without having cash to back up that exposure requires margin every time and in every sense. Margin is not taking out a loan and investing the cash from it. It is the very act of taking an uncollateralized position. Futures, swaps, and any OTC or centrally cleared agreement is a use of margin. A long option position kind of sort of isn't a margin transaction maybe, but the price of an option premium still reflects the risk free rate -- it is absolutely true that a very ITM call still costs more than just stock price - strike, and that difference represents the return of a risk free bond that you are implicitly being charged.",[],0

I'd like to know if I understand it well (the basics).

1. Let's say there is stock currently priced at $10.
2. I buy one call option with a strike of $12 at a cost of $1. So, I actually have to pay $100 right now ($1 x 100), **is this correct?**
3. Before the expiration, the stock price rises to $15.
4. I decide to use my option so I get (15-12-1) \* 100 = $200. **Is that correct?**

If the math above is correct, that means an option is profitable as soon as ($premium - $strike - $ask) > 0. **Am I still right?**  
If I'm right, can you explain me why the hell someone would buy the second option in this table?

|11.05|13|06/11/21|1.20|

I recently was blessed to have won the lottery. After taxes I walked away with just over 2 million dollars. I've been investing relatively successfully for over a decade, but I would love to hear some ideas on how you folks would manage a 1 million dollar investment.

The goal would be to offset my yearly expenses which are around 100k. As I mentioned I've been investing for a long time and I tend to average between 15-20% annually, so the goal could be achieved through my current methods. But I'd love to hear your guys' ideas!

TSLA 35 days to expiration covered calls seem to be capable of racking up over 40k a month in premiums alone. But I've never been a big fan of putting all my eggs into one basket, so I'd likely do 200-300k worth of TSLA covered calls and the rest on traditional growth stocks.

519,gzspv41,2021-05-28,t1_gzsklq9,investing,"Yes, this. Bonds and stocks have traditionally been bundled up together in target date funds precisely because investors flee to bonds when stocks crash, which drives up bond rates, and then they pile back into stocks as soon as they can offer a significantly better return than a T note. That inverse correlation is very strong and makes bonds a reliable downside limiter.

Of course, it's also a very lop-sided correlation, because stocks are much more volatile - when stocks go up a lot, bonds go down a little, but and stocks go down a lot, bonds go up a little. The more you limit your downside on bonds, the more exponentially you limit your upside on stocks.

(A)  Start up that still is still investing more than their earning, or has not yet obtained Economies of Scale (EOS) to earn a profit.

(B)  Company has hit a short-term situation where once they earned a positive EPS, they now have a negative EPS.  (ie:  Many companies in 2020 had Negative EPS due to the adverse COVID Pandemic impact.  Ex: Airlines, Hotels, etc.)

(C)  Some companies simply have not made a profit, or once did, but have not for some time.  Be very suspicious of such companies.

If you pay a lot for relative to earnings, your return has to come from somewhere else. It could be the case that the company grows and lowers it's PE in the future, but thats still a fundamental-based argument. 

Let's assume that not only are multiples high but they are higher than what the growth can make up for. In that case the only place returns can come from is future investors. The stock market turns into a zero sun game. Eventually you run out of greater fools and the price will revert.

That's why many will say that long term returns are driven by fundamental growth. Because fundamentals create value without the need for a greater fool and this value is sustainable long term while speculative value comes and goes.

It's important to make a distinction between low PE and a fundamentally strong company, however. Evaluating a company's future earnings can be very challenging, but in the long term it's what matters.",[],0

If you pay more for a stock, but don't change the assets or earnings, you are buying an objectively worse investment. As it is true for one stock, it is also true for the market as a whole.

Intel's move to 10nm will not happen. They're jumping the line straight to 7nm with the next rollout sometime Q4 2022 or early 2023. All of this means precisely nothing, because at the end of the day, a 14nm intel RL i7 *has equivalent performance* with a R9.

This means that the remaining companies in those sectors will benefit from a supply squeeze in the short term if demand goes back to prepandemic levels, and make big money for a time that is determined by the ability to get new supply going. There are a lot of mines, for instance, that got shut down when they were 90% depleted, and it will just never be worth going back because restart costs are higher than if they had just kept going.   
I'll give you one sector I think is playing out this way: Oil Tankers, for probably 1-2 years. Why? Container ships were old and degraded in 2019/2020, and had a lot of ships due to be replaced. A lot of the older ships got scrapped a few years early when they were idle for 6 months because steel prices came up before contract prices. So why Tankers instead of Container ships? Because every ship yard in the world is building container ships for the next year because they made the deals first, and no oil tankers CAN be built without cancelling those big contracts. Only a few tankers have come off line, but so has a lot of continental production that previously supplied the world through pipelines, and so in the short term that demand has to be met by tankers until all that domestic production can be restarted, which isn't quick. EURN is an ok play, I think DHT is as well.   
This is not my #1 supply squeeze play, but it's a good one, IMO.

ETFs of large markets covers many future situations.

A simple, long-term savings portfolio can look something like this (Vanguard ETFs):

Whole market US (VTI)

Whole market not US (VXUS)

Corporate bonds (VTC)

TIPS (VTIP)

For the split between stocks and bonds, the old rule of thumb was you should put \[100 minus age\] into stocks. So a 30yo would have 70% of money in stocks, 30% in bonds. An 80yo would have 20% stocks, 80% bonds. Many people are now saying the rule should be more like \[110 minus age\] or even \[120 minus age\] since people live longer.

You would get fancier if you do active investing, but that basic setup is a reasonable starting point for a long term portfolio. Talk to someone who knows your tax situation and risk tolerance for specific advice.",[],1

677,gztdcxh,2021-05-28,t3_nn7zx6,investing,"I think they tanked mostly due to the security flaws spectre / meltdown, which didn't affect AMD as bad (though still impacted). Until that issue is solved, either by some new architecture or some mitigating response, I don't think Intel will make a comeback to where it was.

Nevertheless, I do think the security flaws will be appropriately addressed in the future. Thus, I bought-in at 50/share and holding tight. My guess is probably within 10 years there should be a nice return (maybe a 10 bagger). How so?

Just before the March 2018 announcement, Intel was on a rally. What if that had continued? To date, that may have possibly meant 100/share, though it's hard to tell if inflation would have affected this. The price then was about 50 bucks, which is where I bought in. Even if I'm wrong, I should at least be able to get my money back, though, again, I won't be making that decision for years until the miracle announcement comes for the security improvement (or doesn't after 10 or so years).

It's also possible that more damaging flaws will be discovered (actually, that's probably guaranteed), and/or big consumers like Microsoft Azure will start to lose confidence and start replacing Intel with AMD. I don't see the former being too impactful. I mean, meltdown and spectre are hard to beat. The latter I'm not worried about either because, as is the case with Microsoft, what's the real benefit of moving to AMD at this point? That would be a whole lot of hardware to replace, and for what? Though AMD isn't particularly impacted by the newer spectre attacks, it is still certainly impacted by these ""type"" of flaws, and again, susceptible to future flaws and loss in customer faith (for performance). So, it would be a risky and huge bet which I don't think Microsoft (for example) will make.

But, FXAIX and FNSDX aren't quite equivalent. You can probably approximate the target date fund's holdings with 3-5 funds, just adjusting allocations every so often. The premise for a target date fund is sound - glide into higher share of bonds as you get closer to retirement - reduces volatility and so forth. They also  have a mix of domestic large/mid/small caps, in addition to international equities. 

S&P 500 is only a select group of predominantly large-cap companies. Representative of a large part of the US stock market, but not the total market (see FSKAX for that).

100% equities is the way to go to maximize expected return. But.. maybe you'll have enough money either way, and you'd rather have slightly lower expected return in exchange for a better chance of having enough. 

A 90% equity/10% bond mix is much safer and doesn't reduce your average-case balance by much (while eliminating some tail risk of 100% equities).

Anyway, I'd consider something that covers a broader portion of the market, some international equities, and maybe some bonds.

Now.. standard biotech rules apply. Something can sound like a great idea, a cure for cancer, whatever - and turn out to be a flop. I've seen companies go from having an FDA-approved ""cancer vaccine"" (that extended average lifespan by just a few months for people with a certain type of cancer), to going bankrupt.

They have a chance, but there's no guarantees. If you're investing in biotech, even if you have a PhD in biochemistry or whatever and you're privy to all the science, you have to be diversified across at least a few companies, have to have a years-long investment horizon.

Personally I'll let it go to zero before I sell. I'm expecting a lot of returns.. but no guarantees and the bulk of their pipeline could be 2-3 years or longer to FDA approval (again, no guarantees).

Anyway it's clear from your comment that exactly as I thought, tracking error and the relevancy of stock market returns from 1885-1950 are the hills you want to die on in this debate. Regardless i'll leave you with some final thoughts (although no doubt I do expect a weak response haha and will enjoy reading it lol)

1. The ""disingenuous & deceitful"" comment is ridiculous. In my previous comment I could have gone harder on this tracking error point and as we both know you've read the entire article so there's no excuse as to why you missed the following (I didn't include it in my comment because I didn't think you'd still want to respond on the tracking error point haha). In the very last back-test the author did decide to include a model which included tracking error (I assume he did this explicitly for people like you hahaha) and as you and I can both see and as the author explicitly states ""The results suggest that the effect of tracking error on returns may be negligible"". Now I know the word from that sentence which you will want to focus on is ""may"" so instead of just coming back with a random analogy or exaggerated hypothetical (like you love to do) we're at the point where if you respond I want to see some research that indicates the contrary something to the authors view that ""the effect of tracking error on returns is negligible""
2. Again (and sheesh this seems to be a recurring problem of yours) instead of rambling on and on about how a back-test of the S&P 500 from 1950-2009 is and I quote ""Cherry picking a time period"" (hahahahaha as you know I didn't even write that article but even so it's a 60 year period of the most relevant index right now and probably the most relevant to ever exist) why don't you actually do some actual thinking and explain to me why the period 1885-1950 is relevant to this discussion.
3. I'm completely aware that LETF's have lower risk adjusted returns due to the extremely high fees. I don't care about this because for regular individual grade investors an ETF product is extremely easy to use as compared to picking and choosing high beta equities (which involves dedicating a significantly large amount of time researching equities) secondly I don't like margin because when the market crashes that is historically the best time to invest and if you have margin your lender will sell your shares right when you need them the most. 
4. LETF fees will start to come down as they get more widespread use and more competition pops up (I understand they'll still be greater than regular ETF's) but I think it's reasonable to assume there's more scope for LETF fees to come down compared to the fees of regular ETF's, this will help in reducing tacking error and risk-adjusted returns.
5. Markets have circuit breakers at 20% now day's so losing 30% in one day isn't actually possible (at least on the S&P500).
6. Again when considering the context of this debate If I was you I'd be demanding papers to support the following claim "" you may be better off with a portfolio of high beta equities"" but maybe it's just a double standard of yours and you can feel free to just throw statements like that out haha.",[],1

My main advice would be consider doing some of your investing from within a Roth IRA. You can buy all the stocks you mentioned but also don't have to pay taxes. No taxes on gains, no taxes on dividends. It's a tax-free account because the government wants to encourage people to save up for their first home and also retirement.

Lots of nonsense about them losing the apple contract. Apple is 1-3% of their revenue depending on the year. With the current demand, they can EASILY make that up like it didn't even happen.

New ceo was their cto before they started losing market share. He stopped being the technology officer just a few years before they really started losing market share. He's now the CEO and focusing on improving production and product quality and they're already putting more money into those in his first few months in charge.

More cash on hand than AMD has done in revenue their last 3 years combined, so they have plenty of money to put into improving product and production quality.

https://imgur.com/gallery/eElRJQx

The results are indeed awful even without including fee drag. Next thing you’ll be chirping about I’m sure is other ETFs or other 20 year time periods (avoiding Y2K and 2008), which again, I’m sure exist but are besides the point. If you had the misfortune of investing in TQQQ 20 years ago, your retirement would’ve been decimated and the risk you took would not have been worth the potential upside to begin with.

The fact of the matter is - your own cited author says word for word that the upside of leverage for a 2X ETF evaporate once fees are included. Worse, the upside, pre-fee, was never worth it once adjusted for risk to begin with (per the first article’s negative alpha calculations).

By all means, you can conveniently ignore the authors’ well-worded observations by selecting different time periods or even different investment vehicles. And so can I by picking TQQQ on a 20 year retrospective basis - but that was never the sole basis of my critique of your sentimental attachment to this investment vehicle.

What it comes down to is:
1) Author one says returns are positive, but not when adjusted for risk per negative alpha and lower Sharpe ratios

2) Author two says the returns over 1X ETFs might not even be positive once you consider fees

3) Combining 1&2 creates a compelling narrative!

This is a very real risk, that everyone investing in the market now takes (especially considering Tech stocks don't just dominate Nasdaq but also the Dow and S&P500). However I think it say's something that you've just hand picked the absolute best example of a back-test you could find to suit your argument and then stuck this beauty of line straight after it (genuinely laughing at this one btw) ""I’m sure there is other ETFs or other 20 year time periods (avoiding Y2K and 2008), which again, I’m sure exist but are besides the point""... PLEASE EXPLAIN  why the Nasdaq back-test from 200-2020 is the most important back-test there is and looking at any other indices and time-periods is ""besides the point"" if the point is that you want fair and accurate back-test on LETF's then it is very much apart of the point that we should look at a longer time period than 20 years and an index which more broadly represent the US Market (besides the point hahahaha)

In terms of points 1 & 2, my response below:

1. I agree and understand LETF's do not provide greater Risk adjusted returns than unleveraged ETF's (THIS WAS NEVER MY ARGUMENT AT ALL AND I NEVER CLAIMED THIS) . As previously mentioned this is because of the large fees, I understand this and have explained why regardless of this fact LETF's are still a compelling product to me (Ease of use, lower risk than using margin, fees will come down over time, etc)
2. Author two did say that in the context of Total US Stock Market Returns from 1885 - 2009 a leveraged ETF wouldn't have outperformed an unleveraged ETF. However (using the S&P 500) from 1950-2009 it would massively outperform, and when you consider the bull market from 2009-2021 it's safe to say that from 1950-2021 (a 70 year period including rates rising to above 16% as well as coming back down below 2%) using LETF's would lead to massive outperformance (as you like to point out albeit with lower risk-adjusted returns). That is the most relevant and most fair back-test either of us could produce as it covers multiple bear and bull markets, multiple different phases of sector outperformance, multiple different monetary and fiscal policy environments and excludes market returns from 1885-1950 where there was no Federal Reserve, the world was constantly at war, investing was completely different (no regular people invested in stocks), etc ... and when you look at the results of that back-test it indicates gigantic outperformance using leverage (again albeit gross and not risk-adjusted)

996,gzun7mi,2021-05-29,t3_nmtkg5,investing,"I am an American citizen living in Seoul, South Korea. My wife is a Korean citizen and I am a permanent resident of South Korea. I have had a lot of good luck over the last three years, and I am not sure where to go from here. I am in a fortunate, but unique position. So I would appreciate any advice about my specific situation or any resources anyone might be able to direct me to. 

I managed to build a successful business in Seoul. It involved teaching private test prep and college preparatory courses to Korean students. It was actually terrible work that I hated. I had the chance to sell the business for a decent price and I took it. My wife then received a sizable inheritance and we were able to buy, renovate, and furnish our own home in Seoul. Until recently I have only been focusing on building my business, paying off my student loans, and buying a home. Now I am 39 years old and suddenly that is all taken care of. I have no children and will never have children. 

My current situation is: My wife and I own our home. I have about 70,000 US dollars in my bank account in America, about 220 million won, (around 200,000 USD), in My Korean bank account, and my wife and I have a secure retirement plan. My wife has even more money in her account. But that is hers. So I am trying to find a way to invest my money to possibly generate passive income. 

We did have a small rental property in Seoul, but the South Korean government is trying to prevent people from owning multiple properties. So when we purchased our home, we were essentially forced to either sell our rental property or pay a ridiculous amount of taxes on the purchase of our new home. So, we sold our rental property. Investing in real estate in Korea is not an option for me.

My original plan was to dump as much of my money as I can into a total stock market index fund. Perhaps fskax since I have an account with Fidelity. However, the Korean government limits the amount of money I can send overseas each year to 50,000 USD per year. Moreover, investing in the Korean stock market comes with its own limitations, and I believe I would be obligated to pay capital gains taxes to both the US and Korean governments. I am not interested in doing that. I supposed I would need to invest my money in America over several years. 

So, I am not sure what to do. I am suddenly very secure, and the money I now have is more than I expected to have. I don’t have a plan for this. I am not sure if I should just slowly invest in the United States, or if I should diversify my investment in some way. 

My goal is to generate about 30,000 dollars per year in passive income. But I am not sure how to get to that goal with the amount of money I have. I would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions anyone might be able to offer. 

Thank you so much for reading this long post!!!",[],0
