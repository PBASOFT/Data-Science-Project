Yes there have been crashes with Teslas, and the last one in Texas is a tragic example.

Now some things you are getting false. The vision of the boring company is to make these tunnels cheap and to connect important points in a much faster way. To keep the tunnels cheap they have to be small and they are perfectly sized for Teslas cars. The driver wich is in there will not stay forever. As much as i know the traffic is controlled automatically, so no driver is needed but he is there for the good feeling of the customers. Yes there have been crashes with Teslas, and the last one in Texas is a tragic example. But this one has nothing to do with FSD or Autopilot, the news that there was no one on the drivers seat is not proven. And i am sure Autopilot was not enabled, they just drove very fast and couldnt steer fast enough. If you want to know the exact sources you can look at the Tesla daily podcasts episode on that.",[],1

505,gzichxq,2021-05-26,t1_gzi6wcy,wallstreetbets,"Like OP said. I just wanted to add that this world of characters is a staple of good modern Norwegian culture and puppet movies.


Kjell Aukrust, a dude, wrote and drew some amazing charachters back in the 70s or so: A down to earth bike repairman (the guy with the sixpence), an overly anxious and pessimistic hedgehog (he has gone to the outside toilet that is encased in smoke (actually the toilet gets stuck to the rocket and he becomes a blind passenger on the moon trip)) and an overly optimistic bird ""of low morals, but good at the core"".

The three live on top of a pinnacle mountain ""37 miles (metric, so bout 200 English miles ) north, a bit east, and up the valley"". 

The oldest movie is a puppeteering classic; Flåklypa Grand Prix. The bird gets the trio signed up to the world racing championship right in Flåklypa. 

Funded by an arab Oil sheik that got lost in the valleys, ""Sheik Ben Reddick Fy Fasan"" (Ben Raddish Holy Moley) and his assistant/goon Emanuel Desperados ""a true crossbreed of Gorilla and Chimpanzee"", who is the ape at the very end, they embark on the race and of course, through an exciting extended racing sequence, wins. The racing scene, both in scope and execution, for a stop motion film was and is legendary and very technically impressive, and basically consist of building the entire track, mounting a camera on wheels and racing the cars like a big RC shoot. Mixed in with closeups of puppeteering the drivers. The race itself is surprisingly engaging and one of the newer Herbie movies basically jacked the entire race and replicated it in rough terms. I am not sure if they had to buy rights or how they did it. :p

The movie came in the 70s right during the time of Norway becoming an oil nation and being involved in the politics of the middle east etc. So it became a culturally relevant treasure as well. It is tradition to watch it on Christmas Eve for some reason :p 

This here in the post is the last one of three newer Flåklypa-movies. The setup is that the international agreement making it illegal for any nation to lay claim to the moon has become outdated and until the UN can hash out a new agreement, there is a pocket of a few weeks where the moon is up for grabs for any country who can get there as plant a flag. Once Solan/the bird of low morals, hears of the coming space race, several countries have begun their rocket construction with hilariously stereotypical rockets (the US' rocket is so big and overweight that it collapses on takeoff for instance. I think the Chinese rocket falls apart due to bad parts, etc.) and he gets the idea to get funding from the Norwegian government to build a rocket of their own.

There are some nice themes in the background, like how this mid level beurocrats starts to push for a bigger role in the whole thing and through his need for attention and career advancement ends up damaging the entire mission and becoming a bit of an antagonist, or how the hedgie at the beginning of this clip is a prominent local representative of the socialist liberal-conservative party and does little than ruin things with careless champagne-spills and attempting to steal the limelight of the actual inventor of the rocket (the bike repairman) and the austronauts (the bird and the beurocrat).

All in all. It's a very good movie and universe that is very Norwegian, but should be moderately enjoyable and interesting for everyone. So if you need some foreign cinema to check out, it has my Norwegian seal of approval.",[],1

With an outperform rating, the firm estimates a price target of $16.00 for the stock implying an upside of \~58.1%.Noting an FDA document that is supportive of teplizumab efficacy, Cantor Fitzgerald considers the upcoming AdCom meeting as a major catalyst for the stock.Analyst Alethia Young has an outperform rating on the stock, and the price target of \~$19.00 per share implies an upside of \~87.7%.Previously, the analyst slashed the price target for Provention Bio by as much as \~36.0% after FDA cited deficiencies in the marketing application for teplizumab.""",[],0

———————-LEAKED SYNOPSIS———————-

With A flash of light and several yelps the bears dispersed and ran off into the woods. 

SPY opened her eyes and tried to focus them in the light to see her hero. JPOW takes his hand and gently brushes the market’s hair out of her eyes. She blushes. 

“Thank you for saving me from that terrible position. If he drilled another 7% I would never have been the same.”

JPOW looks deep into SPYs eyes. The energy around him shifts from a calming familiar friend to that of a sinister deviant. 

SPY senses she’s not out of harms way. She winced as JPOW leans in to her ear and whispers: “I put on my robe and wizard hat.”",[],1

SPY opened her eyes and tried to focus them in the light to see her hero. JPOW takes his hand and gently brushes the market’s hair out of her eyes. She blushes. 

“Thank you for saving me from that terrible position. If he drilled another 7% I would never have been the same.”

JPOW looks deep into SPYs eyes. The energy around him shifts from a calming familiar friend to that of a sinister deviant. 

SPY senses she’s not out of harms way. She winced as JPOW leans in to her ear and whispers: “I put on my robe and wizard hat.”",[],1

2341,gzif9r9,2021-05-26,t3_nld88o,wallstreetbets,"To anyone who is already invested in AMC, I am only new to investing but I just had a read of their annual report for the fiscal year ending dec 31, 2020 and its looking pretty risky to me.. 😬

They even list on their risks that “The market price and trading volume of shares... has been and may continue to be volatile, and purchasers of our securities could incur substantial losses” (p.3) ‼️

They have suffered the impact of Covid pretty hard, and for them to survive through the uncertainty relies on people going to the movie theatres... which is a risky activity to do during covid. 🦠💉🤧

Box office admissions - when you go to the theatre to watch a new movie, they are the first to license the preview (p.16). Because covid has disrupted the production of new films, AMC has less new releases to show.. plus with the closures of movie theatres across the US have “caused a substantial decline in sales” (p.7) 📉

So due to there being less people going to the theatres to watch movies, they are losing a lot of money, plus still bear the costs of all the properties they lease.. So they are burning cash by keeping theatres open, or still paying their leasing space while unable to keep the business open 🎬💸🔥

2. Food and beverage - their second largest source of income (p.16) Since covid they had to limit their menu, and also if there are less people going to the movies in general, there is less revenue from this. 🍿🍧🍭🍫

So pretty much if you don’t want AMC to go bankrupt, go to the movie theatres and treat yourself to some snacks! 🍿🐸☕️",['AMC'],0

4847,gzij6yk,2021-05-26,t3_nld88o,wallstreetbets,"Repost:  Hourly reminder that AMC is **insanely risky** relative to GME.

AMC is currently trading at a $9000mm market cap... prepandemic levels placed this at $600mm.

AMC has had **no bullish news** for **years**.

The stock is relying *entirely on buy pressure that is detached from the company's actual value.* This **only works in tech companies, because you're investing in the technology and market ownership**.

AMC has **no room to grow in the cinema industry in the USA**. 

AMC has diluted shares from 50m to 500m... raising **billions of dollars**. They **still have debt**.

So why is GME better? Because it *doesn't need a squeeze.* It has more investors, despite what forum sliders want you to believe. It has institutional investors, because of the fundamental value proposition posed by Ryan Cohen and the team they're building.

The company has 99% market share to grow into, and an exploding technological industry to take advantage of. Theyre rapidly and radically transforming their product offerings and their delivery models.

The stock is still undervalue.

If RC had launched a startup with the same vision that Gamestop has... it would be valued *more than Gamestop currently is* at its IPO.

Gamestop has an established customer base, that is now expanding into Europe.

Wake up guys.

AMC isn't it. It never was. It never will be. They aren't working with Gamestop.

Gamestop is safe on its own strengths. It doesn't need a squeeze. It will continue to grow overtime regardless.","['GME', 'AMC']",1

If you are selling the CC, and it gets exercised, then you have to sell 100 shares of AMC at $15/share. If you own the shares for less than $15, your only real exposure is that you will not get any gains <$15/share.

So right now, I have a bunch of calls I sold at $16/share. If the price point is still <$16 on the exercise date (here 6/11), then I will be forced to sell my shares for $16/share, regardless of current value. So if they are, say, $30/share... then I will not make any of that money. Big bummer, but I win either way.

Short - essentially means sell
Long - means buy
Put - the right to sell a stock at a given price 
Call - the right to buy a stock at a given price
So if you are long call on a stock you have the right to buy that stock at a given price, ie if price goes up you win.
If you short a call position you have essentially sold to someone the right to buy the stock (from you), ie price goes up you lose. 
With all 4 positions you can gain/win either buy the actual cost of buying/selling the option contract itself OR by exercising the option and buying/selling the stock itself",[],1

It's an interesting situation for the developers of games though, they have to play catch up constantly, usually a little tweeking will suffice as Roblox devs make constant small reworkings, but not everyone can keep coming back every few days just to make sure their game works as intended, and it's even harder every couple months as medium sized ones happen. The trend is that these developers do actually spend years keeping their games up to date, but what's interesting is that games from 2005 and later where their creators quit, died, or something else, their games can be stolen and updated indefinitely, there almost nothing stopping someone from taking other peoples ""places"" as Roblox calls them, so popular games don't actually ever die, they just get made again and again by ambitious creators which there has never been a shortage of. 

I don't think their problem will actually be updating their platform, that is something they have historically been very anal about, and are still anal about making sure they roll out changes very frequently. Users' reaction from these updates hasn't ever had a high amount of backlash because the creators just keep updating their games so they don't really feel much until the major ones come out. The incentive for creators on Roblox is that they can trade an ingame currency for real money, which is another reason why they stay, and why there is very stiff competition to remain popular.",[],0

2) Building off that last sentence, options contracts deal in units of 100 shares. This means that any dollar amount you see in an options contract, you’re basically multiplying that number by 100. The dollar amount gets very large very quickly.
