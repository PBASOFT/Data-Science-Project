2135,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"Have you been watching the news over this past year and thought to yourself “there’s gotta be a way to turn these problems into money”? 

Did you secretly wish you were one of the degenerate gamblers from Star Wars: the Last Jedi? 

Have you ever seen the movie War Dogs staring known stock expert [Jonah Hill](https://www.businessinsider.com/jonah-hill-hospitalized-fake-cocaine-in-wolf-of-wall-street-2016-8)?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, I’ve got some juicy DD for you. No longer is profiting off of human uncertainty and violence exclusively a rich man’s game. Allow me to explain: 

Vista Outdoors ($VSTO) is an outdoor sports and recreation company that owns several recognizable brands such as Camelbak, Camp Chef, and Bushnell. But that’s not important. You’re reading this because you wanna make quick cash off of the collapse of society. Well $VSTO has got you covered.  

$VSTO owns a massive portion of the shooting sports market. In September of last year they acquired all of Remington’s ammunition factories, the last of which began full-scale production earlier this [year. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/aaronsmith/2021/02/04/bullet-sales-are-booming-as-vista-brings-remington-factory-online/amp/)

In addition to Remington, $VSTO also owns the ammunition brands Federal Premium, CCI, Hevi-shot, Estate Cartridge, and Speer. This accounts for the majority of ammunition produced in the US. 

They also own Alliant Powder, one of the largest producers of smokeless gunpowder in the United States.

You get the idea: if someone is buying ammo, they’re doing it through $VSTO. 

Why is this important? How will this make me money? 

Well right now the US is experiencing one of the largest ammunition shortages in [history.](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/cant-find-ammo-why-great-bullet-shortage-could-last-years-185734)

This shortage is being driven my unprecedented demand for guns and ammo. A combination of fears over [Biden’s ](https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/) gun control plans, a rise in civil unrest, and plain old boredom have caused ammo sales to [skyrocket.](https://thecrimereport.org/2021/01/13/gun-sales-spike-across-the-u-s-following-capitol-riots/) 

Last year roughly 9 million Americans bought guns for the first time. In January 2021 alone, the ATF reported 4.1 million background checks for gun purchases, the largest single month since record keeping [began](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/43371461)

All of these guns are being purchased, and you can’t find ammo fucking *anywhere*. I don’t think it takes a rocket surgeon to understand that guns are useless hunks of metal without ammo to make the boomsticks go boom. 

To prove my point, you can do a little experiment right now in the comfort of your wife’s boyfriend’s home. Try calling your local gun store and ask if you can come in today and purchase 500 rounds of 9mm ammo. When they laugh in your face you’ll see what I’m talking about. 

Late last year, when demand wasn’t as high as it is now, $VSTO reported a backlog of $1 billion dollars in ammunition sales. 1 fucking [BILLION.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/vista-outdoors-ammunition-backlog-billion.amp)
 
They have nearly [doubled ](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/vsto/earnings) their estimated earnings for the past three quarters, and the trend shows no signs of slowing down. 

Their P/E ratio is still hovering at around 8.5/9.0 indicating that the stock is still criminally undervalued. 

This company is printing money as fast as they can make it, and they’ve just acquired more money making factories. You don’t need so much as a single brain wrinkle to understand what I’m saying.

# Discussion:

**What’s a good bet in the short term?**

Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Tech (didn’t think I’d be saying that) is looking pretty nice in the short term. The follow companies in Tech (XLK) have shown some strength and gone on a bit of a run.

https://preview.redd.it/utk79n1qlo171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c33200cbf190f0898afe16c76a22a9353257f036

The following companies are showing signs they may run up in the coming months. Personally, I’d narrow my research to these companies. I’m a semiconductor nerd, so I’m happy to see signs of a turnaround in INTC, AMD, and MU.

**What’s a good bet in the long term?**

Utilities (XLU), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Healthcare (XLV) all look like good sectors for long term bets. The problem is that they are starting to underperform the SPY in the short term.

XLRE seems to be floating around with the SPY, and slightly outperforming in the short term. 

Personally, I’m going to focus on short term investments within strong short term sectors until I see the trajectory for these long term plays start to turn around in the short term.

**This is a Casino Sir - My Bets/Positions:**

**XLK -– Long Call - 7/16 @ 0.7 delta**

**XLY -– Long Call - 7/16 @ 0.7 delta**

Wanted to enter a PAYC PCS but the B/A was too wide.

**DESCRIPTION**

Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for corporate, public, & residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.

**History**

In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for 72% market share of total level 2 charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with Switchback late Feb 2021;

**What is the business model of CHPT?**

Charge Point sells hardware & software (equipment & network subscriptions) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.

**BUSINESS OVERVIEW**

* Market Cap: \~$7bn
* Shares Float 299mln
* Institutional ownership \~13%
* 2 Year CAGR Revenue Growth 65.65%; 5 Year 60%;

$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", carving \~53% market share of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, L2 \~75% and L1, \~3% of market share. People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 & L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.

**Products**

Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers - Solutions for every use case, all vehicle types and brands - High efficiency in power and footprint - Modular, scalable, secure architecture designed for serviceability- Unparalleled quality; advanced testing (vehicle, functional, climate, environment) for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding

**Software Enables** \- Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks

**Challengers**

* $VLTA; Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it*.
* SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).
* $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus.
* $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:*""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""*
* $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

**Near Term Catalysts**

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: ""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

**Long Term Catalysts**

\- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

**Miscellaneous**

$CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.

No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.

Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st.

**MOAT**

* First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)
* Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)
* Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)
* Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

**CONCLUSION**

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in eco friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology.  Yes most of its network is L2 chargers, but it's where most of the money is to be made. As users go to restaurants, malls, sports events/concerts, office, cinema, universities or just a Parking Lot! There will be L2 charger not L3 due to: Charger Cost Basis/Time Parked. Pretty straightforward formula.

**Why am I interested in $CHPT?**

Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.

Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.

A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.

This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.

BB:
60 $30c 01/2022 at $0.27
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Already powering many of the telematics of current cars, BB is poised to benefit from their established relationships with big automakers. Getting certified with an automaker is not easy, so it is a barrier to entry for other companies wanting in on the action. Security and reliability are top of mind for these companies. You don’t want your car to get hacked easily, so what better than a cybersecurity company that happens to also do EV software, and already has experience with ICE cars. I did a long DD here 4 months ago and still stand by it: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


SONY:
100 shares at $101
🚀🚀🚀


I wouldn’t call this the Japanese equivalent for BB, as they aren’t a cybersecurity company. But Sony has a thriving consumer and B2B business that benefits greatly from consumer demand: the fact that they are literally selling every single PS5 they make is amazing and image sensors going out on many cell phones, including Apple using both image and lidar sensors from Sony. Great solid volume of sales to stabilize the company after some stagnant years.

On PS5, it’s actually a good thing that there’s a chip shortage. As Sony loses money on the hardware (and earn on game royalties and licenses), they are buying time to refine their manufacturing to lower costs, and lose less money on hardware sales. And because demand is so hot for the PS5, they are on track to build a bigger platform than even PS4 to charge 20-30% on every game they sell. That’s some fat margin.

Now, you’re probably wondering…wtf, I’m here to read about EVs, why you telling me about PS5s? Yeah, you’re right but a conglomerate like Sony is multifaceted. While they build up their EV software platform, they have cash cows in imagery and video games. And if Apple is really building an EV, I would bet (am literally betting) that they would rely on currently trusted partners like Sony for their imaging needs. You sit inside an Apple car and camera recognizes who you are and where you’re sitting? Well that’s probably a Sony camera…or 20 of them. There will be so many cameras inside and outside of any Apple car. I mean…my iPhone 12 has 4 cameras, and it’s a tiny slab of glass and my family can’t sit inside and drive down the road with others in the environment.

And when Japanese automakers get into EVs, they’ll look into a Japanese partnership. Guess who’s probably in pole position?

Full disclosure, I also have 150 AAPL.



VW:
200 shares @ $33.32
🚀🚀🚀🚀

You are all excited about Ford. I am too but I’m not buying into them because I think they are overhyped. But what’s interesting about Ford’s EV play is that they are partnering with VW to do so. That means…even if Ford can’t sell that many cars, VW will probably still benefit from joint research development and cost sharing. We also know how much more climate change is viewed as reality in Europe, and that’s VW’s home territory. VW already launching EVs under Audi, Porsche in the premium sector, VW, Skoda and Seat in the value sector, and Bentley and Lamborghini will likely have their ultra premium EVs soon.

But you might wonder…what about Tesla? They are so great! Well yeah they aren’t that bad. But VW is a goddamn monster. It’s kind of cute when Tesla announces a new plant, oh this is my 4th plant! We now have Shanghai and Fremont and building out Berlin and Austin. That’s cute. VW has 136 plants around the world. The economies of scale is insane and will be able to source materials for incredibly better deals. Oh and there’s that other partner called Ford who builds millions of cars a year also jumping into to beat on suppliers to give them both better pricing. Welcome to the big leagues, EVs.

VW is likely to launching 5-10 EVs per year, the equivalent the full Tesla line up every year. And they have Electricfy America network (and Canada) and similar in Europe.

And one more thing: VW also does trucks. Like 18 wheeler trucks. They are one of the biggest manufacturers, behind brands such as Man, Scania, and Navistar. And trucks have even more of a compelling business case for EVs…Will merge this part with Volvo.


Volvo:
800 shares @ $26
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Going to keep this briefer because this is already a novel. Now, when I say Volvo, I don’t mean Volvo Cars. That’s bought by Geely and yes they are making EVs under Volvo and Polestar brands. But I’m taking about AB Volvo, still out of Sweden, building trucks, mining equipment, backhoes, haul trucks and cranes.

EVs are so more more compelling because of the use and mileage they get. It’s not uncommon for a one year old truck to have a million miles. And as cities around the world clamp down on urban center access (congestion or polluter fees common in Europe, and allow EVs in for discount or free), EVs increasingly make more sense. You save so much on lower op/maintenance costs, avoiding tolls and tax credits. Oil prices will be going back up so saving on fuel costs is the smart thing to do.

Another thing is, governments around the world are spending trillions on infrastructure stimulus. What do these trillions buy? Concrete, steel, Volvo construction equipment, labor. Where does the concrete, steel and other commodities (like rising gold and silver prices) come from? They get mined out of the ground with big Caterpillar, Liebherr and Volvo equipment. Yep, there’s Volvo again!

So if you believe stimulus is happening, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe inflation is real, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe EV is the future for hauling shorter distances and/or heavy loads, Volvo is a good choice.

All my opinions only, not financial advice. Currency amounts all written in USD.

During the pandemic, this SOFTWARE company helped a lot of smaller and midsize businesses as they were easily able to set up an e-commerce presence with Shopify's help. As a result, SHOP revenue increased a lot and the stock got propelled up to a crazy over 200 times forward earnings and a still to high current $$ 1240 price tag today. Yeah, that is my opinion only but Note: At the last press conference they said that operating cost will increase \[and by revenue increase will slow down\], THEY SAID IT - but nobody wants to hear it.

Together they started an extensive press campaign, the one that we see even today: ""Shopify poised to go up"" I read today? Is it not that always when another one of these messages comes out A LOT OF stocks are suddenly traded? And that when the price goes up \[and even down\] it is often a very controlled 40bucks a day?    


IF you still want to read more, let's look up that complete marketing campaign to bring the SHOP stock up again:   
First Shopify was compared with Amazon itself - which is laughable. Even Karl Marx knew already that capitalism tends to create a monopoly. Shopify ... by helping all the little and medium companies with their software is the exact opposite of Amazon. Not to mention that the malls are full again ... meaning fewer people will buy online than during the pandemic. Which at least in the short and midterm will bring online revenues down a bit.

Then Google mentioned some Google button that makes it easier to find Shopify customers. Well yes but that doesn't help Shopify results at all. AND it makes clear that Shopify customers severely lack visibility compared with an omnipotent Amazon.   
   
Then the Shopify payment system was hyped. Buy now pay later? REALLY? The """"have's"""" have credit cards and pay with them as they even get perks/payback and points for it. So who uses the buy now pay later system? The ""DO NOT HAVE's with only a half-decent credit score of course.

Sorry but when I read about this I was only able to imagine the Shopify payment system as a """"buy now pay NEVER"""" system and I certainly had no idea how this helps the Shopify stock in the long run. Do the revenue numbers go up in the quarterly results? What about liabilities? 

Then SHOP was mentioned as the ""stock to have"" in 2021 ?? Not even worth a comment. 

For me, the only thing that is ""poised to happen"" is that the pockets of the three leaving former executives of Shopify are filled and that the buying retail investors are screwed over in about 2 months' time with a two-digit percentage loss. 

And I write all this while I actually like the Shopify story, as I like Tesla and so many things that are happening with all these wonderful tech companies ...  
But IMO the SHOP stock goes back to $800 exactly as Tesla went down from 900\[intraday\] to now 600...

**○ 4.1 Orladeyo**™ **(Berotralstat) oral pill**

&#x200B;

Orladeyo is the ***first Oral approved*** treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with ***hereditary angioedema (HAE)*****,** disease which is estimated to affect ***1 in 50,000 people***

&#x200B;

\- Orladeyo was firstly approved in the ***USA*** ***December the 3rd,*** ***2020. Q4***

\- Orladeyo received ***Japan*** NHI price listing approval ***April the 14th, 2021. Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***Europe*** approval ***April the 30th, 2021 Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***UK*** approval ***May the 12th, 2021 Q2***

&#x200B;

***CEO*** himself Jon Stonehouse ***confirmed*** in the [last conference call, ( 22:15 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/) ***Orladeyo will annually*** be generating ***$500MM plus revenue.***

\-Serge Belanger ( ***Analyst*** ): I think in the past you've talked about ***sales potential for Orladeyo of 500 million plus***, are you still reiterating that target?

\- Stonehouse ( ***CEO*** ): ***Yeah make sure you remember the plus.***

&#x200B;

***Orladeyo*** is [ranked](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/20-most-expensive-prescription-drugs-in-2021.html) the ***#13 most expensive drug*** ***in the USA*** market. ***$37,308*** is approximately what patients must monthly pay to access the drug.

&#x200B;

***Before oral Orladeyo*** was approved for HAE, ***patients*** would only have treatments that required usage of ***needles***. This dramatically ***reduced the*** ***quality of their life***, making some of them quit using the treatment. That's the main ***reason*** why ***Orladeyo is a game changer***.

&#x200B;

As it's shown in[ the January 2021 Corporate Presentation](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16), Physicians expect to Prescribe ***Orladeyo for over 40% of HAE Patients.***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **4.1.1** **Pricings/Revenue**

&#x200B;

**USA**

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, ***7500 diagnosed and treated,*** 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for ***3,075 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to ***485,000$***

&#x200B;

**Japan**

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with ***Torii Pharmaceuticals.*** A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to ***at*** ***least reach 500 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to ***$248,500***

***Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment*** from Torii.

***BioCryst will receive*** tiered royalties ranging from ***20% - 40% of Japanese sales.***

&#x200B;

**Europe**

It's estimated to be around ***12,000 HAE patients in Europe.*** Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of ***4,920 patients*** in Europe.

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's ***$248,500/year.*** This number should soon be confirmed.

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

&#x200B;

\- ***USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$***

\- ***Japan - 500p x 248,5K = 124,250,000$***

\- ***EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$***

&#x200B;

Summing it all up we get $2,751,270,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of ***$2,628,170,000***. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

&#x200B;

* **4.1.2 Q1 EarningsReport Beat**

&#x200B;

On May the 6th, 2021 BCRX presented Q1 Earnings Report data which managed to ***Beat Analysts estimates***. Basically what matters from this ***Q1 ER*** is that it was the ***launch of Orladeyo***, and Analysts wanted to see a decent amount of money generated by it. They were expecting Orladeyo sales to top ***$3.1MM*** ***and Orladeyo actually generated*** ***$10.94MM***, this is a ***353% sales beat***

The consequence of the ER beat was an increase of ***24.06%*** in the ***SP***

&#x200B;

It's ***important*** to mention that ***revenues generated this Q1*** only came from the ***USA.***

This ***Q2 Orladeyo*** has been ***approved in Japan/Europe/UK*** aswell, adding new sources of revenue.

***Orladeyo sales*** are expected to ***grow exponentially*** each quarter. Main reason for it is that it has been approved in the countries mentioned above. The other reason is that the amount of ***patients*** they treat will slowly ***score up*** as insurance companies allow their clients to be treated with this drug.

&#x200B;

* **4.1.3 Orladeyo value**

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating ***$2,628,170,000*** a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier **x7**. We get a total of ***$18,397,190,000*** meaning an increase of ***$104,46*** in the stock price.

**○ 4.2 Peramivir** ™ **(Rapivab)**

Peramivir (Rapivab) is an antiviral drug for the treatment of influenza. Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. It is approved for intravenous administration.

On 19 December 2014, the FDA approved Peramivir to treat influenza infection in adults. Peramivir has also been approved in Japan and South Korea and is available in Japan as Rapiacta and in South Korea as Peramiflu.

The U.S. government (department of Health and Human Services) gave BioCryst Pharmaceuticals more than $77 million to finish the Phase III clinical development of peramivir. In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about $180 million to the program.

In 2013 the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current $234.8 million contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) peramivir.

&#x200B;

* **4.2.1** **Peramivir value**

With all the explanations given above and having in mind Peramivir is a government bio-defense drug the value of Rapivab can not be less than ***$500,000,000*** conservatively speaking.

&#x200B;

[Peramivir value: $2,84 SP](https://preview.redd.it/gc09kk81up171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e7fee79582328b95e4db5853fb52c5590dc8b55)

&#x200B;

**○ 4.3 Galidesivir - BCX4430**

Galidesivir (BCX4430) is a broad-spectrum antiviral in advanced development for the treatment of viruses that pose a threat to health and national security, including SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika.

The NIAID and BARDA have been funding the development and testing of Galidesivir for over 15 years as they recognize its importance in preparation for all future pandemics. The 31st of August, 2020 NIAID Awarded $44 Million Contract to Advance Development of Galidesivir.

Galidesivir has also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in vitro against more than 20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses in nine different families, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses. (Hepatitis C, West Nile, Dengue, Jap Encephalitis, Yellow Fever, TBEV, OHFV, and Zika), orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses..

Galidesivir is the first antiviral that has ever shown such potential, and to top it off, it is now known from the Phase I trial and now the Brazil part 1 trial to clearly be safe and show dose-sensitive effects in people. And based on multiple animal studies, it works equally effectively as a pill that is stable for years at room temperature. Not only that, but this antiviral, unlike any of the others, has excellent penetration of the blood brain barrier as was seen in the macaque Zika virus study.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.1 Efficacy**

Galidesivir was safe and generally well tolerated in Phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics trials by both intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy subjects. In animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits against a variety of serious pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika viruses.

The company on December 22nd announced that all three doses were perfectly safe for the patients. In addition, they found that patients had a dose-sensitive reduction in virus levels in their lungs. They went on to say that an animal model, showed that Galidesivir significantly reduced COVID-19-associated lung damage.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.2 Galidesivir value**

We must have in mind that Galidesivir is a Government funded bio-defense drug, that aims to treat a wide range of viruses as explained before. Its global stockpiling for future pandemics is also an absolute certainty given its long-term stability. With all the given explanations, conservatively talking Galidesivir can not be worth less than ***$1B this is 5,67$***.

&#x200B;

[Galidesivir value: 5,67$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/cylw2s73up171.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea63ebda1f07ddc72762ad137ec92ac17bb87f7)

**○ 4.4 FOP - BCX9250**

FOP is an ultra-rare, severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. Patients with FOP become bound by this irregular ossification over time, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP.

There are an estimated 3,500 to 9,000 patients worldwide, with 900 diagnosed so far. Currently there aren’t any approved treatments.

Market size for this treatment is estimated to reach 500M-900M in 2025, growing to 3B in 2028 as more patients are diagnosed. With a price ranging from $900K-$1M/year.

Last December the 21st Biocryst announced positive Phase 1 results

“BCX9250 was safe and well tolerated at all doses studied, with linear and dose-proportional exposure supporting once-daily dosing.”.

“In preclinical studies, BCX9250 demonstrated potency for the target kinase, selectivity, safety and strong suppression of HO in animal models.”

&#x200B;

* **4.4.1 BCX9250 Value**

BCX9250 study will most likely take 4 years to finish, this is, until 2025. By then the potential market we will be aimming for, will be $750,000,000 aprox.

Drugs that are in Phase 1 studies are said to have a 10% chance of making it to the market. Following that, BCX9250 as of now shuld be valued at ***$75,000,000 = 0.43$***

&#x200B;

BCX9930 is a novel, ***oral***, potent and selective small molecule ***inhibitor of Factor D*** which recently completed Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases.

The 3rd of August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ***Fast Track designation*** for oral Factor D inhibitor, BCX9930.

***This is how Bill Sheridan*** ( *Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President )* defined [BCX9930 in the last conference call ( 22:00 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/)

***""BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project, this is a potent specific Factor D inhibitor. So, the mechanism of action is to block the enzymatic activity of that complement enzyme, that enzyme sits at the very start of the alternative pathway of complement. So, that opens up a whole set of opportunities across diferent diseases that are driven by dysregulation of that alternative pathway of complement and the amplification loop that's embedded in that pathway""***

On March 22, 2021 BCRX announced that ***BCX9930 will be advancing from Ph1 to*** ***Pivotal*** ***Trials in PNH*** ***following the successful proof of concept trial.***

The company announced that a ***Pivotal trial for PNH***, and ***proof of concept trials*** in renal complement-mediated diseases are expected to begin in ***2H 2021.***

On March 22, the company unveiled BCX9930 ***Ph1 data***. The most relevant information from that Ph1 is mentioned below.

""***100%*** of treatment-naïve patients and **83%** of C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients were ***transfusion-free***. *Prior to the trial*, 22 percent of treatment-naïve patients and 17 percent of C5 inadequate responders were transfusion-free ""

Recently the FDA changed the ***primary end-point*** of the BCX9930 study, for it to be the ***change of Hemoglobin level from baseline***. The ***secondary end-point would be the % transfusion free rate reduction.***

This news ***greatly benefit BCX9930's study*** considering how it has ***showed the strongest results in those 2 mentioned study end-points.***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.4 Alternative Pathway**

What makes BCX9930 a game changer, is the wide spectrum of Alternative Pathway Dysregulation disease it can treat. It can treat up to[ 8 diseases](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 26) as of now, that's why insiders call it ***“Pipeline in a molecule”***.

* **4.5.5 Potential market size by 2025**

Assuming BCX9930 will be approved by 2025, and it will be able to treat the previously mentioned 8 diseases, we reach to the following conclusion. The potential ***market size BCX9930*** will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to ***$28,56B - $51B / year.*** This numbers are explained below, stating the yearly market size each of those 8 diseases aim for.

* **4.5.6 Alexion buy out**

On December the 12th, 2020 ***Alexion announced that AstraZeneca was going to buy them out for 39B***. More than ***90% of their revenue come from their “""""Factor D""""” C5 inhibitor,*** being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen.

You might think, why does this matter? Well, remember we have a Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion’s, and is able to treat more diseases than they do aswell. This buy out reflects how ***undervalued BCX9930 is.***

Apart from the buy out, I think it's essential to mention that ***Alexion bought Achillion's ""Factor D"" when it was in Ph2 for $930MM.***

In ***2019*** Alexion's SOLIRIS® (eculizumab) net product sales were ***$3,946.4 million***. Soliris is currently approved to treat ***PNH and aHUS***. Have in mind BCX9930 is able to treat 8 diseases, aiming for a wider market, while having greater efficacy/safety profile.

As a quick ***example***, using the average biotech mid-cap ***x7*** revenue multiplier, and the revenue ***Soliris*** managed to generate in 2019, ***3,964B = 27,748B***. It would mean a ***SP value of $157.56*** for ***BCRX***. I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in-class treatment and it's able to treat more diseases, therefore aims for a bigger revenue opportunity.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.7 Soliris/Ultomoris patients survey**

BCRX recently did a ***survey with 23 patients***, 12 of them using ***Ultomiris*** and the other 11 ***Soliris.*** The survey showed that ***91% of the patients were interested in switching*** due to the reasons explained in the pic below.

Some of the ***patients treated with BCX9930*** were asked some questions, among them, the ***6th*** one expressed his ***desire to be able to be treated with BCX9930 oral pill.*** As we have seen it before with Orladeyo, patients are ***highly willing to switch from needles to oral-pill*** form treatments.

* **4.5.8 BCX9930 From a Ph1 to a Ph3**

&#x200B;

On March 22, 2021 BCX9930 PNH Ph1 data was shown, the obtained ***results were so good that it enabled BCX9930 jump from a*** ***Ph1 to a pivotal Ph3 trial in PNH***\*\*\*, totally skipping the Ph2.\*\*\*

Additional ***proof of concept BCX9930*** ***Ph2 trials in Renal Complement-Mediated diseases*** will be made.

Straight ***jumping from a*** ***ph1 to a pivotal ph3*** trial, is something that's ***not common in the bio world*** and could be taken as a really ***bullish sign***. Apart from it being a bullish sign, it ***accelerates the process of development of the drug***, giving it a chance to ***hit the market in a smaller span of ti***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.9** **BCX9930 valuation**

Having in mind BCX9930 is a ***potential*** ***best-in-class treatment***, that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their “Factor D” c5 inhibitor, and the yearly market size BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the $28,56B - $51B mark. BCX9930 valuation can not be less than a ***30% of Alexion’s buy out price***, this is ***11.7B meaning 66.44$.***

&#x200B;

[BCX9930 value: 66.44$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/phh7inljup171.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2994d05aec97ea91d0e085ed352ce68ce2c217c)

&#x200B;

* **5. Strong BO Buy Out candidate**

As we have explained in the Institutional section before, all good bio-tech investors do know who Alexander ***J.Denner founder of Sarissa Capital*** is. After recently ***increasing his stake in BCRX***, along with BlackRock, he now ***owns a 5%*** of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Denner, has increased his position in BCRX by an stunning ***789% in the last 3 quarters***, showing ***strong conviction*** in the company.

Since Denner opened his position in Alexion, it took him 5 months to close the buy out deal, as shown in the picture below

After this exhaustive analysis on the company, we can easily acknowledge that BCRX is more than a ***strong BO candidate***. A buy out coming from ***BIIB***, company ***where Denner forms part of the BOD board of directors,*** would make total sense ***in the following 2 years*** once BCX9930 Factor D phase III data is unveiled.

It also is important to mention that ***Bank of America added BCRX to the list of top M&A candidates ( Mergers and Acquisitions )*** as of October 30th, 2020. Stating how they believe BCRX will have a ***strong revenue growth in the incoming years.***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **6. Alexion's performance with Soliris**

As we have explained before, Alexion Pharmaceuticals has its own """"""""Factor D"""""""" C5 inhibitor inhibitor called Soliris.

Alexion could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we could expect from Biocryst's in the incoming years. ***From 2007 to 2014 Alexion's stock price grew a 1777%***. Being valued at ***10.5$ in 2007 and 186.6$ in 2014.***

Revenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their Factor D was approved to treat additional diseases, and the market size it captured became wider.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6ix67squup171.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4bf5e078a9461e9e4c067833d7af2f9d802da8f

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals managing to do the SP move Alexion did, is more than ***doable*** with the unique pipeline it possess. Having in mind ***Alexion made 66.4 MM revenue the first year while BCRX expects to generate 500 MM plus with Orladeyo,*** apart from it, additional revenue generated by ***Rapivab/Galidesivir stockpillings*** may come. Incoming Earning Reports are meant to be potential catalysts for the company, gradually becoming more meaningful as the market size they capture with Orladeyo becomes wider.

&#x200B;

* **7.** **De-risked company**

Last December the 7th, 2020 BCRX announced they made a Royalty ***agreement with Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management.*** With this agreement BCRX was funded with ***$325,000,000 in order to support Orladeyo launch***. Setting the company in an attractive position of ***not needing to do any money rising ""Offering"".***

***Jon Stonehouse CEO***, also confirmed that the company will ***not need to do offerings anymore.*** The fact that the company is already generating revenue with Orladeyo is another strong evidence that confirms money risings will not be needed anymore.

It's important to restate that as part of the Royalty agreement, ***Royalty Pharma will receive a 1% on global net sales of BCX9930, if approved.*** Showing how ***bullish they are on BCX9930*** and their willingness to invest at it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gezetorvup171.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6880f64de595b224faf806b09f22385ba88dabf

&#x200B;

* **8. Forward looking statements**

&#x200B;

1. From now on ***EarningReports should be catalysts and positive for the company,*** obtaining better results each quarter as the company settles down and receives additional approvals for Orladeyo in different countries.
2. Orladeyo ***European launch.***
3. The company will have to provide some colour on the ***BCX9930 PNH pivotal trial***, how it will be planned etc etc... Aswell as the ***PH2 trials*** in complement-mediated diseases.
4. ***BCX9250 Next steps*** should soon be shared by the company
5. ***BCX4430 Galidesivir*** recently completed a Ph1, additional information about the study may be given. It's important to mention that this study was fully funded by the NIAID.
6. ***Galidesivir/Rapivab stockpilling.***

&#x200B;

*From now on revenues/BCX9930 updates are the main catalysts.*

&#x200B;

* **9. Conclusion**

After this exhaustive analysis, we come to the conclusion that ***BCRX is severely undervalued***, and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline, it should be valued around ***180$***. The StockPrice fair value number will keep growing as we keep getting data updates from the on-going studies and Orladeyo revenues keep growing, making it an ***excellent long-term hold and buy out candidate.***

I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range. My initial plan is to hold the shares for the long term, at least 2 years more provided that we don't get bought out earlier. I expect the StockPrice to keep rising as Orladeyo revenues flow in and BCX9930 trials keep progressing, aswell as the rest of the pipeline.",nmfr14,[],1

Orladeyo is the ***first Oral approved*** treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with ***hereditary angioedema (HAE)*****,** disease which is estimated to affect ***1 in 50,000 people***

&#x200B;

\- Orladeyo was firstly approved in the ***USA*** ***December the 3rd,*** ***2020. Q4***

\- Orladeyo received ***Japan*** NHI price listing approval ***April the 14th, 2021. Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***Europe*** approval ***April the 30th, 2021 Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***UK*** approval ***May the 12th, 2021 Q2***

&#x200B;

***CEO*** himself Jon Stonehouse ***confirmed*** in the [last conference call, ( 22:15 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/) ***Orladeyo will annually*** be generating ***$500MM plus revenue.***

\-Serge Belanger ( ***Analyst*** ): I think in the past you've talked about ***sales potential for Orladeyo of 500 million plus***, are you still reiterating that target?

\- Stonehouse ( ***CEO*** ): ***Yeah make sure you remember the plus.***

&#x200B;

***Orladeyo*** is [ranked](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/20-most-expensive-prescription-drugs-in-2021.html) the ***#13 most expensive drug*** ***in the USA*** market. ***$37,308*** is approximately what patients must monthly pay to access the drug.

&#x200B;

***Before oral Orladeyo*** was approved for HAE, ***patients*** would only have treatments that required usage of ***needles***. This dramatically ***reduced the*** ***quality of their life***, making some of them quit using the treatment. That's the main ***reason*** why ***Orladeyo is a game changer***.

&#x200B;

As it's shown in[ the January 2021 Corporate Presentation](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16), Physicians expect to Prescribe ***Orladeyo for over 40% of HAE Patients.***

&#x200B;

* **4.1.1** **Pricings/Revenue**

&#x200B;

**USA**

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, ***7500 diagnosed and treated,*** 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for ***3,075 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to ***485,000$***

&#x200B;

**Japan**

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with ***Torii Pharmaceuticals.*** A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to ***at*** ***least reach 500 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to ***$248,500***

***Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment*** from Torii.

***BioCryst will receive*** tiered royalties ranging from ***20% - 40% of Japanese sales.***

&#x200B;

**Europe**

It's estimated to be around ***12,000 HAE patients in Europe.*** Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of ***4,920 patients*** in Europe.

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's ***$248,500/year.*** This number should soon be confirmed.

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

&#x200B;

\- ***USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$***

\- ***Japan - 500p x 248,5K = 124,250,000$***

\- ***EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$***

&#x200B;

Summing it all up we get $2,751,270,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of ***$2,628,170,000***. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

&#x200B;

* **4.1.2 Q1 EarningsReport Beat**

&#x200B;

On May the 6th, 2021 BCRX presented Q1 Earnings Report data which managed to ***Beat Analysts estimates***. Basically what matters from this ***Q1 ER*** is that it was the ***launch of Orladeyo***, and Analysts wanted to see a decent amount of money generated by it. They were expecting Orladeyo sales to top ***$3.1MM*** ***and Orladeyo actually generated*** ***$10.94MM***, this is a ***353% sales beat***

The consequence of the ER beat was an increase of ***24.06%*** in the ***SP***

&#x200B;

It's ***important*** to mention that ***revenues generated this Q1*** only came from the ***USA.***

This ***Q2 Orladeyo*** has been ***approved in Japan/Europe/UK*** aswell, adding new sources of revenue.

***Orladeyo sales*** are expected to ***grow exponentially*** each quarter. Main reason for it is that it has been approved in the countries mentioned above. The other reason is that the amount of ***patients*** they treat will slowly ***score up*** as insurance companies allow their clients to be treated with this drug.

&#x200B;

* **4.1.3 Orladeyo value**

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating ***$2,628,170,000*** a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier **x7**. We get a total of ***$18,397,190,000*** meaning an increase of ***$104,46*** in the stock price.

&#x200B;

**○ 4.2 Peramivir** ™ **(Rapivab)**

Peramivir (Rapivab) is an antiviral drug for the treatment of influenza. Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. It is approved for intravenous administration.

On 19 December 2014, the FDA approved Peramivir to treat influenza infection in adults. Peramivir has also been approved in Japan and South Korea and is available in Japan as Rapiacta and in South Korea as Peramiflu.

The U.S. government (department of Health and Human Services) gave BioCryst Pharmaceuticals more than $77 million to finish the Phase III clinical development of peramivir. In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about $180 million to the program.

In 2013 the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current $234.8 million contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) peramivir.

&#x200B;

* **4.2.1** **Peramivir value**

With all the explanations given above and having in mind Peramivir is a government bio-defense drug the value of Rapivab can not be less than ***$500,000,000*** conservatively speaking.

&#x200B;

[Peramivir value: $2,84 SP](https://preview.redd.it/gc09kk81up171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e7fee79582328b95e4db5853fb52c5590dc8b55)

&#x200B;

**○ 4.3 Galidesivir - BCX4430**

Galidesivir (BCX4430) is a broad-spectrum antiviral in advanced development for the treatment of viruses that pose a threat to health and national security, including SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika.

The NIAID and BARDA have been funding the development and testing of Galidesivir for over 15 years as they recognize its importance in preparation for all future pandemics. The 31st of August, 2020 NIAID Awarded $44 Million Contract to Advance Development of Galidesivir.

Galidesivir has also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in vitro against more than 20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses in nine different families, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses. (Hepatitis C, West Nile, Dengue, Jap Encephalitis, Yellow Fever, TBEV, OHFV, and Zika), orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses..

Galidesivir is the first antiviral that has ever shown such potential, and to top it off, it is now known from the Phase I trial and now the Brazil part 1 trial to clearly be safe and show dose-sensitive effects in people. And based on multiple animal studies, it works equally effectively as a pill that is stable for years at room temperature. Not only that, but this antiviral, unlike any of the others, has excellent penetration of the blood brain barrier as was seen in the macaque Zika virus study.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.1 Efficacy**

Galidesivir was safe and generally well tolerated in Phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics trials by both intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy subjects. In animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits against a variety of serious pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika viruses.

The company on December 22nd announced that all three doses were perfectly safe for the patients. In addition, they found that patients had a dose-sensitive reduction in virus levels in their lungs. They went on to say that an animal model, showed that Galidesivir significantly reduced COVID-19-associated lung damage.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.2 Galidesivir value**

We must have in mind that Galidesivir is a Government funded bio-defense drug, that aims to treat a wide range of viruses as explained before. Its global stockpiling for future pandemics is also an absolute certainty given its long-term stability. With all the given explanations, conservatively talking Galidesivir can not be worth less than ***$1B this is 5,67$***.

&#x200B;

[Galidesivir value: 5,67$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/cylw2s73up171.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea63ebda1f07ddc72762ad137ec92ac17bb87f7)

**○ 4.4 FOP - BCX9250**

FOP is an ultra-rare, severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. Patients with FOP become bound by this irregular ossification over time, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP.

There are an estimated 3,500 to 9,000 patients worldwide, with 900 diagnosed so far. Currently there aren’t any approved treatments.

Market size for this treatment is estimated to reach 500M-900M in 2025, growing to 3B in 2028 as more patients are diagnosed. With a price ranging from $900K-$1M/year.

Last December the 21st Biocryst announced positive Phase 1 results

“BCX9250 was safe and well tolerated at all doses studied, with linear and dose-proportional exposure supporting once-daily dosing.”.

“In preclinical studies, BCX9250 demonstrated potency for the target kinase, selectivity, safety and strong suppression of HO in animal models.”

&#x200B;

* **4.4.1 BCX9250 Value**

BCX9250 study will most likely take 4 years to finish, this is, until 2025. By then the potential market we will be aimming for, will be $750,000,000 aprox.

Drugs that are in Phase 1 studies are said to have a 10% chance of making it to the market. Following that, BCX9250 as of now shuld be valued at ***$75,000,000 = 0.43$***

**○ 4.5 Oral Factor D inhibitor - BCX9930**

&#x200B;

BCX9930 is a novel, ***oral***, potent and selective small molecule ***inhibitor of Factor D*** which recently completed Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases.

The 3rd of August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ***Fast Track designation*** for oral Factor D inhibitor, BCX9930.

***This is how Bill Sheridan*** ( *Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President )* defined [BCX9930 in the last conference call ( 22:00 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/)

***""BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project, this is a potent specific Factor D inhibitor. So, the mechanism of action is to block the enzymatic activity of that complement enzyme, that enzyme sits at the very start of the alternative pathway of complement. So, that opens up a whole set of opportunities across diferent diseases that are driven by dysregulation of that alternative pathway of complement and the amplification loop that's embedded in that pathway""***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.1** **Staff excitement**

Staff team from Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc seem to be really positive and ***excited*** about the incoming ***future of BCX9930***. Such excitement has been seen in the last conference calls where staff members such as the CEO Jon P.Stonehouse, or the Vice President, William P.Sheridan would say the ***following words.***

&#x200B;

***“Embarrassment of riches”***

***“We agree with Alexion that creating a potent specific and great oral Factor D inhibitor is a great challenge, and we are happy we have one”***

***“My only concern is i have no concerns”***

***“Pipeline in a molecule”***

***“My aim is to make c5 inhibitors obsolete”***

***“This is Big”***

""***BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project""***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.2** **Phase I study**

On March 22, 2021 BCRX announced that ***BCX9930 will be advancing from Ph1 to*** ***Pivotal*** ***Trials in PNH*** ***following the successful proof of concept trial.***

The company announced that a ***Pivotal trial for PNH***, and ***proof of concept trials*** in renal complement-mediated diseases are expected to begin in ***2H 2021.***

On March 22, the company unveiled BCX9930 ***Ph1 data***. The most relevant information from that Ph1 is mentioned below.

""***100%*** of treatment-naïve patients and **83%** of C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients were ***transfusion-free***. *Prior to the trial*, 22 percent of treatment-naïve patients and 17 percent of C5 inadequate responders were transfusion-free ""

"" ***Hemoglobin levels increased*** by a mean of ***3.5 g/dL*** in treatment-naïve patients and ***3.2 g/dL*** in C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients; at last visit, mean hemoglobin levels were 11.8 g/dL and 12.2 g/dL, respectively ""

To understand properly how ***positive BCX9930 data was***, below you can find a photo that gathers the data from the main studies done in this kind of inhibitors. What mainly should catch your attention is the ***Hemoglobin change from baseline and the % of transfusion units reduction from baseline*** \- This data has been gathered by ***Barclays***.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.3  BCX9930 Study Primary End point change agreement with the FDA**

Recently the FDA changed the ***primary end-point*** of the BCX9930 study, for it to be the ***change of Hemoglobin level from baseline***. The ***secondary end-point would be the % transfusion free rate reduction.***

This news ***greatly benefit BCX9930's study*** considering how it has ***showed the strongest results in those 2 mentioned study end-points.***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.4 Alternative Pathway**

What makes BCX9930 a game changer, is the wide spectrum of Alternative Pathway Dysregulation disease it can treat. It can treat up to[ 8 diseases](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 26) as of now, that's why insiders call it ***“Pipeline in a molecule”***. Those ***8 diseases*** are shown in the pic below.

&#x200B;

1- PNH (Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)

2 - aHUS (Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome)

3 - ANCA vasculitis (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis)

4 - Lupus Nephritis

5 - IgAN vasculitis

6 - C3G (Glomerulonephritis)

7 - PMN (Primary membranous nephropathy)

8 - IgAN (IgA nephropathy)

&#x200B;

* **4.5.5 Potential market size by 2025**

Assuming BCX9930 will be approved by 2025, and it will be able to treat the previously mentioned 8 diseases, we reach to the following conclusion. The potential ***market size BCX9930*** will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to ***$28,56B - $51B / year.*** This numbers are explained below, stating the yearly market size each of those 8 diseases aim for.

&#x200B;

1 - 2 "" Due to COVID-19, the market for ***PNH and aHUS*** was anticipated to grow from US$ 4855 million in 2020 to US$ ***7023 million*** by 2026; it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.89% during 2021–2026.""

3 - “ ***Anca vasculitis*** prevalence in the USA rounds 10-20 per million = 3300-6600 patients. As a treatment example we use Soliris, which costs $500,000/year. We would aim for ***1,65B - 3.3B*** market size as of now. Expected to grow by 2025""

4 - “"" The global systemic ***lupus erythematosus*** market size is expected to reach ***USD 3.08 billion*** by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc., exhibiting a CAGR of 7.0% during the forecast period. ""

5 - 8 “""***IgAN.*** The gathered disease prevalence data varies according to in which coutry the study has been undergone. Data gathered from the undergone study in East Asia, show the prevalence rounds 45 / million. meaning 14,850 patients, or a potential ***7,25B*** market size using Soliris's yearly price ""

6 - ""***C3G:*** Prevalence in the USA round 14-140 per 1M people = 4620-46,200 patients. If those patients were to be treated with Soliris which costs $500,000 / year, the potential market size we aim for rounds ***2,31B - 23,1B*** ""

7 - "" ***PMN*** prevalence is similar to the one of IgAN, so we would potentially aim for a similar market size, meaning ***7.25B***""

&#x200B;

* **4.5.6 Alexion buy out**

On December the 12th, 2020 ***Alexion announced that AstraZeneca was going to buy them out for 39B***. More than ***90% of their revenue come from their “""""Factor D""""” C5 inhibitor,*** being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen.

You might think, why does this matter? Well, remember we have a Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion’s, and is able to treat more diseases than they do aswell. This buy out reflects how ***undervalued BCX9930 is.***

Apart from the buy out, I think it's essential to mention that ***Alexion bought Achillion's ""Factor D"" when it was in Ph2 for $930MM.***

In ***2019*** Alexion's SOLIRIS® (eculizumab) net product sales were ***$3,946.4 million***. Soliris is currently approved to treat ***PNH and aHUS***. Have in mind BCX9930 is able to treat 8 diseases, aiming for a wider market, while having greater efficacy/safety profile.

As a quick ***example***, using the average biotech mid-cap ***x7*** revenue multiplier, and the revenue ***Soliris*** managed to generate in 2019, ***3,964B = 27,748B***. It would mean a ***SP value of $157.56*** for ***BCRX***. I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in-class treatment and it's able to treat more diseases, therefore aims for a bigger revenue opportunity.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.7 Soliris/Ultomoris patients survey**

BCRX recently did a ***survey with 23 patients***, 12 of them using ***Ultomiris*** and the other 11 ***Soliris.*** The survey showed that ***91% of the patients were interested in switching*** due to the reasons explained in the pic below.

Some of the ***patients treated with BCX9930*** were asked some questions, among them, the ***6th*** one expressed his ***desire to be able to be treated with BCX9930 oral pill.*** As we have seen it before with Orladeyo, patients are ***highly willing to switch from needles to oral-pill*** form treatments.

* **4.5.8 BCX9930 From a Ph1 to a Ph3**

&#x200B;

On March 22, 2021 BCX9930 PNH Ph1 data was shown, the obtained ***results were so good that it enabled BCX9930 jump from a*** ***Ph1 to a pivotal Ph3 trial in PNH***\*\*\*, totally skipping the Ph2.\*\*\*

Additional ***proof of concept BCX9930*** ***Ph2 trials in Renal Complement-Mediated diseases*** will be made.

Straight ***jumping from a*** ***ph1 to a pivotal ph3*** trial, is something that's ***not common in the bio world*** and could be taken as a really ***bullish sign***. Apart from it being a bullish sign, it ***accelerates the process of development of the drug***, giving it a chance to ***hit the market in a smaller span of ti***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.9** **BCX9930 valuation**

Having in mind BCX9930 is a ***potential*** ***best-in-class treatment***, that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their “Factor D” c5 inhibitor, and the yearly market size BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the $28,56B - $51B mark. BCX9930 valuation can not be less than a ***30% of Alexion’s buy out price***, this is ***11.7B meaning 66.44$.***

&#x200B;

[BCX9930 value: 66.44$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/phh7inljup171.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2994d05aec97ea91d0e085ed352ce68ce2c217c)

* **5. Strong BO Buy Out candidate**

As we have explained in the Institutional section before, all good bio-tech investors do know who Alexander ***J.Denner founder of Sarissa Capital*** is. After recently ***increasing his stake in BCRX***, along with BlackRock, he now ***owns a 5%*** of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Denner, has increased his position in BCRX by an stunning ***789% in the last 3 quarters***, showing ***strong conviction*** in the company.

Since Denner opened his position in Alexion, it took him 5 months to close the buy out deal, as shown in the picture below

📷

After this exhaustive analysis on the company, we can easily acknowledge that BCRX is more than a ***strong BO candidate***. A buy out coming from ***BIIB***, company ***where Denner forms part of the BOD board of directors,*** would make total sense ***in the following 2 years*** once BCX9930 Factor D phase III data is unveiled.

It also is important to mention that ***Bank of America added BCRX to the list of top M&A candidates ( Mergers and Acquisitions )*** as of October 30th, 2020. Stating how they believe BCRX will have a ***strong revenue growth in the incoming years.***

* **6. Alexion's performance with Soliris**

As we have explained before, Alexion Pharmaceuticals has its own """"""""Factor D"""""""" C5 inhibitor inhibitor called Soliris.

Alexion could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we could expect from Biocryst's in the incoming years. ***From 2007 to 2014 Alexion's stock price grew a 1777%***. Being valued at ***10.5$ in 2007 and 186.6$ in 2014.***

Revenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their Factor D was approved to treat additional diseases, and the market size it captured became wider.

&#x200B;

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals managing to do the SP move Alexion did, is more than ***doable*** with the unique pipeline it possess. Having in mind ***Alexion made 66.4 MM revenue the first year while BCRX expects to generate 500 MM plus with Orladeyo,*** apart from it, additional revenue generated by ***Rapivab/Galidesivir stockpillings*** may come. Incoming Earning Reports are meant to be potential catalysts for the company, gradually becoming more meaningful as the market size they capture with Orladeyo becomes wider.

&#x200B;

* **7.** **De-risked company**

Last December the 7th, 2020 BCRX announced they made a Royalty ***agreement with Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management.*** With this agreement BCRX was funded with ***$325,000,000 in order to support Orladeyo launch***. Setting the company in an attractive position of ***not needing to do any money rising ""Offering"".***

***Jon Stonehouse CEO***, also confirmed that the company will ***not need to do offerings anymore.*** The fact that the company is already generating revenue with Orladeyo is another strong evidence that confirms money risings will not be needed anymore.

It's important to restate that as part of the Royalty agreement, ***Royalty Pharma will receive a 1% on global net sales of BCX9930, if approved.*** Showing how ***bullish they are on BCX9930*** and their willingness to invest at it.

&#x200B;

* **8. Forward looking statements**

&#x200B;

1. From now on ***EarningReports should be catalysts and positive for the company,*** obtaining better results each quarter as the company settles down and receives additional approvals for Orladeyo in different countries.
2. Orladeyo ***European launch.***
3. The company will have to provide some colour on the ***BCX9930 PNH pivotal trial***, how it will be planned etc etc... Aswell as the ***PH2 trials*** in complement-mediated diseases.
4. ***BCX9250 Next steps*** should soon be shared by the company
5. ***BCX4430 Galidesivir*** recently completed a Ph1, additional information about the study may be given. It's important to mention that this study was fully funded by the NIAID.
6. ***Galidesivir/Rapivab stockpilling.***

&#x200B;

*From now on revenues/BCX9930 updates are the main catalysts.*

&#x200B;

* **9. Conclusion**

After this exhaustive analysis, we come to the conclusion that ***BCRX is severely undervalued***, and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline, it should be valued around ***180$***. The StockPrice fair value number will keep growing as we keep getting data updates from the on-going studies and Orladeyo revenues keep growing, making it an ***excellent long-term hold and buy out candidate.***

I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range. My initial plan is to hold the shares for the long term, at least 2 years more provided that we don't get bought out earlier. I expect the StockPrice to keep rising as Orladeyo revenues flow in and BCX9930 trials keep progressing, aswell as the rest of the pipeline.",nmfr14,[],1

It is currently trading at Book Value (finviz, feel free to correct me on this), and is in the process of successfully deleveraging it's debt (rising stock prices would help with this process creating a virtuous cycle).

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote...

and balking at even a penny of additional liquidity. How the Fed will continue to monetize debt then, when the repo system is now out of collateral, is anyone's guess.

By mid-July, we’ll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase higher yields in the FX swap market amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative

Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho.

Ngl this seems like a prettt solid play rn low volume and it’s just been on the slow and steady rise 

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG’s Graphene and UQ’s patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

graph looks good. good buy. but if u want idk. not a professional buy at ur own risk. yeah.🚀.

Okay! Breakfast came early for You GMG.V Bulls. Its Pencil lead, not crayons today though, although Im hoping that someone with Market DD will post here in a bit and make us some fresh hot crayons. this is my first time on here doing anything like this, so go easy on me:

So here's some stuff I was able to get:

The only person with a science background That I can really find is their CSO:

Ashock Kumar Nanjundan CSO:

Pukyong National University

Degree Name: Doctor of Engineering

Materials Science

Current Adjunct professor at Queensland University (Gotta Do Something for the Kids Right)

Publications:

I’ll Let you guys go to sci hub to download this review for yourself, But the TLDR is that this dude knows his shit on how to dope graphene to get it to work as a battery.

Cited by: 178, For less academic Apes this means that 178 other scientists were like “yeah this dude knows his shit, Imma cite what he’s saying ~basically~ as fact.

https://doi.org/10.1039/C6EE00158K

Ashock’s most cited individual work comes from his first post-doc that he completed in Korea.

Polyaniline-Grafted Reduced Graphene Oxide for Efficient Electrochemical Supercapacitors.

Basically he does some pretty no-brainer synthesys to link graphene and another semi-conducting polymer that really enhances the graphene properties (Pretty nobrainer basic polymer bro shit, even so, it look like he probably wrote good supporting info and saved a lot of people a lot of time).

https://doi.org/10.1021/nn204688c

Total citations for all work combined: 3,845

This is pretty damn good for someone so young.

Here is a research paper that I'm having trouble accessing that seems to be relevant to this company's work on aluminum-graphene based batteries. If anyone can find it, DM me!

https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202010569

All in all, based on what I can see from linkedin about this company, they have a great CSO. He does seem to be both teaching and doing research in academia. He was recently brought up from a “Head Product Scientist” role to a CSO role, so hopefully this change will reflect a move away from more general research and towards really developing this stuff for GMG.V

I’m concerned about product development at this company, specifically it's unclear who is managing it. I’m not able to see every employee linkedin, but it may be that one of the people not visible is leading product development. You might be thinking ~but wait~ what if there is a group of slave PHD students/postdocs at the university of Queensland working on this stuff?  Yes there is. Nanjundan has some connections with the YU group (https://aibn.uq.edu.au/yu.)) And then here is a press release about it. (https://graphenemg.com/gmg-the-university-of-queensland-research-uni-quest-kick-off-the-graphene-enhanced-aluminium-ion-battery-development-project/)

It sounds like the company has recently had some really good results in R&D, but until I can see and Audit the product/process development lead, ill probably avoid going all in $$.

~sometimes~ the COO role at these companies can be a technical role that helps with process development, but the COO looks to be doing mostly operations type stuff and is non-technical. Not wholly worrisome, but I do want to see  more listed employees on linkedin and then someone that is leading doing process development/scale up and quality control… quality assurance wouldn't hurt either.

It also looks like this company is casting a wide net of potential products, but it's entirely unclear if it has launched any of them. Hopefully it does. It feels uncommon these days for a company to go the IPO route so early on in R&D, most will look to do venture capital funding first to launch a few products. Is this an australian thing? Or is this just crowdfunding with extra steps? If you have more info, lets talk

I'm a materials science ape and don't know anything about Stock Market DD, but why not rely on science DD to decide on investments?

**○ 4.1 Orladeyo**™ **(Berotralstat) oral pill**

&#x200B;

Orladeyo is the ***first Oral approved*** treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with ***hereditary angioedema (HAE)*****,** disease which is estimated to affect ***1 in 50,000 people***

&#x200B;

\- Orladeyo was firstly approved in the ***USA*** ***December the 3rd,*** ***2020. Q4***

\- Orladeyo received ***Japan*** NHI price listing approval ***April the 14th, 2021. Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***Europe*** approval ***April the 30th, 2021 Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***UK*** approval ***May the 12th, 2021 Q2***

&#x200B;

***CEO*** himself Jon Stonehouse ***confirmed*** in the [last conference call, ( 22:15 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/) ***Orladeyo will annually*** be generating ***$500MM plus revenue.***

\-Serge Belanger ( ***Analyst*** ): I think in the past you've talked about ***sales potential for Orladeyo of 500 million plus***, are you still reiterating that target?

\- Stonehouse ( ***CEO*** ): ***Yeah make sure you remember the plus.***

&#x200B;

***Orladeyo*** is [ranked](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/20-most-expensive-prescription-drugs-in-2021.html) the ***#13 most expensive drug*** ***in the USA*** market. ***$37,308*** is approximately what patients must monthly pay to access the drug.

&#x200B;

***Before oral Orladeyo*** was approved for HAE, ***patients*** would only have treatments that required usage of ***needles***. This dramatically ***reduced the*** ***quality of their life***, making some of them quit using the treatment. That's the main ***reason*** why ***Orladeyo is a game changer***.

&#x200B;

As it's shown in[ the January 2021 Corporate Presentation](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16), Physicians expect to Prescribe ***Orladeyo for over 40% of HAE Patients.***

&#x200B;

* **4.1.1** **Pricings/Revenue**

&#x200B;

**USA**

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, ***7500 diagnosed and treated,*** 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for ***3,075 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to ***485,000$***

&#x200B;

**Japan**

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with ***Torii Pharmaceuticals.*** A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to ***at*** ***least reach 500 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to ***$248,500***

***Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment*** from Torii.

***BioCryst will receive*** tiered royalties ranging from ***20% - 40% of Japanese sales.***

&#x200B;

**Europe**

It's estimated to be around ***12,000 HAE patients in Europe.*** Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of ***4,920 patients*** in Europe.

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's ***$248,500/year.*** This number should soon be confirmed.

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

&#x200B;

\- ***USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$***

\- ***Japan - 500p x 248,5K = 124,250,000$***

\- ***EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$***

&#x200B;

Summing it all up we get $2,751,270,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of ***$2,628,170,000***. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

&#x200B;

* **4.1.2 Q1 EarningsReport Beat**

&#x200B;

On May the 6th, 2021 BCRX presented Q1 Earnings Report data which managed to ***Beat Analysts estimates***. Basically what matters from this ***Q1 ER*** is that it was the ***launch of Orladeyo***, and Analysts wanted to see a decent amount of money generated by it. They were expecting Orladeyo sales to top ***$3.1MM*** ***and Orladeyo actually generated*** ***$10.94MM***, this is a ***353% sales beat***

The consequence of the ER beat was an increase of ***24.06%*** in the ***SP***

&#x200B;

It's ***important*** to mention that ***revenues generated this Q1*** only came from the ***USA.***

This ***Q2 Orladeyo*** has been ***approved in Japan/Europe/UK*** aswell, adding new sources of revenue.

***Orladeyo sales*** are expected to ***grow exponentially*** each quarter. Main reason for it is that it has been approved in the countries mentioned above. The other reason is that the amount of ***patients*** they treat will slowly ***score up*** as insurance companies allow their clients to be treated with this drug.

&#x200B;

* **4.1.3 Orladeyo value**

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating ***$2,628,170,000*** a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier **x7**. We get a total of ***$18,397,190,000*** meaning an increase of ***$104,46*** in the stock price.

**○ 4.2 Peramivir** ™ **(Rapivab)**

Peramivir (Rapivab) is an antiviral drug for the treatment of influenza. Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. It is approved for intravenous administration.

On 19 December 2014, the FDA approved Peramivir to treat influenza infection in adults. Peramivir has also been approved in Japan and South Korea and is available in Japan as Rapiacta and in South Korea as Peramiflu.

The U.S. government (department of Health and Human Services) gave BioCryst Pharmaceuticals more than $77 million to finish the Phase III clinical development of peramivir. In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about $180 million to the program.

In 2013 the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current $234.8 million contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) peramivir.

&#x200B;

* **4.2.1** **Peramivir value**

With all the explanations given above and having in mind Peramivir is a government bio-defense drug the value of Rapivab can not be less than ***$500,000,000*** conservatively speaking.

&#x200B;

[Peramivir value: $2,84 SP](https://preview.redd.it/gc09kk81up171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e7fee79582328b95e4db5853fb52c5590dc8b55)

&#x200B;

**○ 4.3 Galidesivir - BCX4430**

Galidesivir (BCX4430) is a broad-spectrum antiviral in advanced development for the treatment of viruses that pose a threat to health and national security, including SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika.

The NIAID and BARDA have been funding the development and testing of Galidesivir for over 15 years as they recognize its importance in preparation for all future pandemics. The 31st of August, 2020 NIAID Awarded $44 Million Contract to Advance Development of Galidesivir.

Galidesivir has also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in vitro against more than 20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses in nine different families, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses. (Hepatitis C, West Nile, Dengue, Jap Encephalitis, Yellow Fever, TBEV, OHFV, and Zika), orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses..

Galidesivir is the first antiviral that has ever shown such potential, and to top it off, it is now known from the Phase I trial and now the Brazil part 1 trial to clearly be safe and show dose-sensitive effects in people. And based on multiple animal studies, it works equally effectively as a pill that is stable for years at room temperature. Not only that, but this antiviral, unlike any of the others, has excellent penetration of the blood brain barrier as was seen in the macaque Zika virus study.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.1 Efficacy**

Galidesivir was safe and generally well tolerated in Phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics trials by both intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy subjects. In animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits against a variety of serious pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika viruses.

The company on December 22nd announced that all three doses were perfectly safe for the patients. In addition, they found that patients had a dose-sensitive reduction in virus levels in their lungs. They went on to say that an animal model, showed that Galidesivir significantly reduced COVID-19-associated lung damage.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.2 Galidesivir value**

We must have in mind that Galidesivir is a Government funded bio-defense drug, that aims to treat a wide range of viruses as explained before. Its global stockpiling for future pandemics is also an absolute certainty given its long-term stability. With all the given explanations, conservatively talking Galidesivir can not be worth less than ***$1B this is 5,67$***.

&#x200B;

**○ 4.4 FOP - BCX9250**

FOP is an ultra-rare, severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. Patients with FOP become bound by this irregular ossification over time, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP.

There are an estimated 3,500 to 9,000 patients worldwide, with 900 diagnosed so far. Currently there aren’t any approved treatments.

Market size for this treatment is estimated to reach 500M-900M in 2025, growing to 3B in 2028 as more patients are diagnosed. With a price ranging from $900K-$1M/year.

Last December the 21st Biocryst announced positive Phase 1 results

“BCX9250 was safe and well tolerated at all doses studied, with linear and dose-proportional exposure supporting once-daily dosing.”.

“In preclinical studies, BCX9250 demonstrated potency for the target kinase, selectivity, safety and strong suppression of HO in animal models.”

&#x200B;

* **4.4.1 BCX9250 Value**

BCX9250 study will most likely take 4 years to finish, this is, until 2025. By then the potential market we will be aimming for, will be $750,000,000 aprox.

Drugs that are in Phase 1 studies are said to have a 10% chance of making it to the market. Following that, BCX9250 as of now shuld be valued at ***$75,000,000 = 0.43$***

**○ 4.5 Oral Factor D inhibitor - BCX9930**

&#x200B;

BCX9930 is a novel, ***oral***, potent and selective small molecule ***inhibitor of Factor D*** which recently completed Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases.

The 3rd of August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ***Fast Track designation*** for oral Factor D inhibitor, BCX9930.

***This is how Bill Sheridan*** ( *Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President )* defined [BCX9930 in the last conference call ( 22:00 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/)

***""BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project, this is a potent specific Factor D inhibitor. So, the mechanism of action is to block the enzymatic activity of that complement enzyme, that enzyme sits at the very start of the alternative pathway of complement. So, that opens up a whole set of opportunities across diferent diseases that are driven by dysregulation of that alternative pathway of complement and the amplification loop that's embedded in that pathway""***

* **4.5.2** **Phase I study**

On March 22, 2021 BCRX announced that ***BCX9930 will be advancing from Ph1 to*** ***Pivotal*** ***Trials in PNH*** ***following the successful proof of concept trial.***

The company announced that a ***Pivotal trial for PNH***, and ***proof of concept trials*** in renal complement-mediated diseases are expected to begin in ***2H 2021.***

On March 22, the company unveiled BCX9930 ***Ph1 data***. The most relevant information from that Ph1 is mentioned below.

""***100%*** of treatment-naïve patients and **83%** of C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients were ***transfusion-free***. *Prior to the trial*, 22 percent of treatment-naïve patients and 17 percent of C5 inadequate responders were transfusion-free ""

* **4.5.3  BCX9930 Study Primary End point change agreement with the FDA**

Recently the FDA changed the ***primary end-point*** of the BCX9930 study, for it to be the ***change of Hemoglobin level from baseline***. The ***secondary end-point would be the % transfusion free rate reduction.***

This news ***greatly benefit BCX9930's study*** considering how it has ***showed the strongest results in those 2 mentioned study end-points.***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.4 Alternative Pathway**

What makes BCX9930 a game changer, is the wide spectrum of Alternative Pathway Dysregulation disease it can treat. It can treat up to[ 8 diseases](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 26) as of now, that's why insiders call it ***“Pipeline in a molecule”***. Those ***8 diseases*** are shown in the pic below.

6 - C3G (Glomerulonephritis)

7 - PMN (Primary membranous nephropathy)

8 - IgAN (IgA nephropathy)

&#x200B;

* **4.5.5 Potential market size by 2025**

Assuming BCX9930 will be approved by 2025, and it will be able to treat the previously mentioned 8 diseases, we reach to the following conclusion. The potential ***market size BCX9930*** will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to ***$28,56B - $51B / year.*** This numbers are explained below, stating the yearly market size each of those 8 diseases aim for.

&#x200B;

1 - 2 "" Due to COVID-19, the market for ***PNH and aHUS*** was anticipated to grow from US$ 4855 million in 2020 to US$ ***7023 million*** by 2026; it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.89% during 2021–2026.""

3 - “ ***Anca vasculitis*** prevalence in the USA rounds 10-20 per million = 3300-6600 patients. As a treatment example we use Soliris, which costs $500,000/year. We would aim for ***1,65B - 3.3B*** market size as of now. Expected to grow by 2025""

4 - “"" The global systemic ***lupus erythematosus*** market size is expected to reach ***USD 3.08 billion*** by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc., exhibiting a CAGR of 7.0% during the forecast period. ""

6 - ""***C3G:*** Prevalence in the USA round 14-140 per 1M people = 4620-46,200 patients. If those patients were to be treated with Soliris which costs $500,000 / year, the potential market size we aim for rounds ***2,31B - 23,1B*** ""

7 - "" ***PMN*** prevalence is similar to the one of IgAN, so we would potentially aim for a similar market size, meaning ***7.25B***""

&#x200B;

* **4.5.6 Alexion buy out**

On December the 12th, 2020 ***Alexion announced that AstraZeneca was going to buy them out for 39B***. More than ***90% of their revenue come from their “""""Factor D""""” C5 inhibitor,*** being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen.

You might think, why does this matter? Well, remember we have a Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion’s, and is able to treat more diseases than they do aswell. This buy out reflects how ***undervalued BCX9930 is.***

Apart from the buy out, I think it's essential to mention that ***Alexion bought Achillion's ""Factor D"" when it was in Ph2 for $930MM.***

In ***2019*** Alexion's SOLIRIS® (eculizumab) net product sales were ***$3,946.4 million***. Soliris is currently approved to treat ***PNH and aHUS***. Have in mind BCX9930 is able to treat 8 diseases, aiming for a wider market, while having greater efficacy/safety profile.

As a quick ***example***, using the average biotech mid-cap ***x7*** revenue multiplier, and the revenue ***Soliris*** managed to generate in 2019, ***3,964B = 27,748B***. It would mean a ***SP value of $157.56*** for ***BCRX***. I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in-class treatment and it's able to treat more diseases, therefore aims for a bigger revenue opportunity.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.7 Soliris/Ultomoris patients survey**

BCRX recently did a ***survey with 23 patients***, 12 of them using ***Ultomiris*** and the other 11 ***Soliris.*** The survey showed that ***91% of the patients were interested in switching*** due to the reasons explained in the pic below.

After this exhaustive analysis on the company, we can easily acknowledge that BCRX is more than a ***strong BO candidate***. A buy out coming from ***BIIB***, company ***where Denner forms part of the BOD board of directors,*** would make total sense ***in the following 2 years*** once BCX9930 Factor D phase III data is unveiled.

It also is important to mention that ***Bank of America added BCRX to the list of top M&A candidates ( Mergers and Acquisitions )*** as of October 30th, 2020. Stating how they believe BCRX will have a ***strong revenue growth in the incoming years.***

* **6. Alexion's performance with Soliris**

As we have explained before, Alexion Pharmaceuticals has its own """"""""Factor D"""""""" C5 inhibitor inhibitor called Soliris.

Alexion could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we could expect from Biocryst's in the incoming years. ***From 2007 to 2014 Alexion's stock price grew a 1777%***. Being valued at ***10.5$ in 2007 and 186.6$ in 2014.***

Revenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their Factor D was approved to treat additional diseases, and the market size it captured became wider.

&#x200B;

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals managing to do the SP move Alexion did, is more than ***doable*** with the unique pipeline it possess. Having in mind ***Alexion made 66.4 MM revenue the first year while BCRX expects to generate 500 MM plus with Orladeyo,*** apart from it, additional revenue generated by ***Rapivab/Galidesivir stockpillings*** may come. Incoming Earning Reports are meant to be potential catalysts for the company, gradually becoming more meaningful as the market size they capture with Orladeyo becomes wider.

&#x200B;

* **7.** **De-risked company**

Last December the 7th, 2020 BCRX announced they made a Royalty ***agreement with Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management.*** With this agreement BCRX was funded with ***$325,000,000 in order to support Orladeyo launch***. Setting the company in an attractive position of ***not needing to do any money rising ""Offering"".***

***Jon Stonehouse CEO***, also confirmed that the company will ***not need to do offerings anymore.*** The fact that the company is already generating revenue with Orladeyo is another strong evidence that confirms money risings will not be needed anymore.

It's important to restate that as part of the Royalty agreement, ***Royalty Pharma will receive a 1% on global net sales of BCX9930, if approved.*** Showing how ***bullish they are on BCX9930*** and their willingness to invest at it.

&#x200B;

* **8. Forward looking statements**

&#x200B;

1. From now on ***EarningReports should be catalysts and positive for the company,*** obtaining better results each quarter as the company settles down and receives additional approvals for Orladeyo in different countries.
2. Orladeyo ***European launch.***
3. The company will have to provide some colour on the ***BCX9930 PNH pivotal trial***, how it will be planned etc etc... Aswell as the ***PH2 trials*** in complement-mediated diseases.
4. ***BCX9250 Next steps*** should soon be shared by the company
5. ***BCX4430 Galidesivir*** recently completed a Ph1, additional information about the study may be given. It's important to mention that this study was fully funded by the NIAID.
6. ***Galidesivir/Rapivab stockpilling.***

&#x200B;

*From now on revenues/BCX9930 updates are the main catalysts.*

&#x200B;

* **9. Conclusion**

After this exhaustive analysis, we come to the conclusion that ***BCRX is severely undervalued***, and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline, it should be valued around ***180$***. The StockPrice fair value number will keep growing as we keep getting data updates from the on-going studies and Orladeyo revenues keep growing, making it an ***excellent long-term hold and buy out candidate.***

I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range. My initial plan is to hold the shares for the long term, at least 2 years more provided that we don't get bought out earlier. I expect the StockPrice to keep rising as Orladeyo revenues flow in and BCX9930 trials keep progressing, aswell as the rest of the pipeline.",nmfr14,[],1

It is currently trading at Book Value (finviz, feel free to correct me on this), and is in the process of successfully deleveraging it's debt (rising stock prices would help with this process creating a virtuous cycle). Throw in its forward P/E of 7.36 and it looks very cheap in this most irrational of markets.

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote...

and balking at even a penny of additional liquidity. How the Fed will continue to monetize debt then, when the repo system is now out of collateral, is anyone's guess.

By mid-July, we’ll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase higher yields in the FX swap market amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative

Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho.

Ngl this seems like a prettt solid play rn low volume and it’s just been on the slow and steady rise 

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG’s Graphene and UQ’s patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

graph looks good. good buy. but if u want idk. not a professional buy at ur own risk. yeah.🚀.

Okay! Breakfast came early for You GMG.V Bulls. Its Pencil lead, not crayons today though, although Im hoping that someone with Market DD will post here in a bit and make us some fresh hot crayons. this is my first time on here doing anything like this, so go easy on me:

So here's some stuff I was able to get:

The only person with a science background That I can really find is their CSO:

Ashock Kumar Nanjundan CSO:

Pukyong National University

Degree Name: Doctor of Engineering

Materials Science

Current Adjunct professor at Queensland University (Gotta Do Something for the Kids Right)

Publications:

I’ll Let you guys go to sci hub to download this review for yourself, But the TLDR is that this dude knows his shit on how to dope graphene to get it to work as a battery.

Cited by: 178, For less academic Apes this means that 178 other scientists were like “yeah this dude knows his shit, Imma cite what he’s saying ~basically~ as fact.

https://doi.org/10.1039/C6EE00158K

Ashock’s most cited individual work comes from his first post-doc that he completed in Korea.

Polyaniline-Grafted Reduced Graphene Oxide for Efficient Electrochemical Supercapacitors.

Basically he does some pretty no-brainer synthesys to link graphene and another semi-conducting polymer that really enhances the graphene properties (Pretty nobrainer basic polymer bro shit, even so, it look like he probably wrote good supporting info and saved a lot of people a lot of time).

https://doi.org/10.1021/nn204688c

Total citations for all work combined: 3,845

This is pretty damn good for someone so young.

Here is a research paper that I'm having trouble accessing that seems to be relevant to this company's work on aluminum-graphene based batteries. If anyone can find it, DM me!

https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202010569

All in all, based on what I can see from linkedin about this company, they have a great CSO. He does seem to be both teaching and doing research in academia. He was recently brought up from a “Head Product Scientist” role to a CSO role, so hopefully this change will reflect a move away from more general research and towards really developing this stuff for GMG.V

I’m concerned about product development at this company, specifically it's unclear who is managing it. I’m not able to see every employee linkedin, but it may be that one of the people not visible is leading product development. You might be thinking ~but wait~ what if there is a group of slave PHD students/postdocs at the university of Queensland working on this stuff?  Yes there is. Nanjundan has some connections with the YU group (https://aibn.uq.edu.au/yu.)) And then here is a press release about it. (https://graphenemg.com/gmg-the-university-of-queensland-research-uni-quest-kick-off-the-graphene-enhanced-aluminium-ion-battery-development-project/)

It sounds like the company has recently had some really good results in R&D, but until I can see and Audit the product/process development lead, ill probably avoid going all in $$.

~sometimes~ the COO role at these companies can be a technical role that helps with process development, but the COO looks to be doing mostly operations type stuff and is non-technical. Not wholly worrisome, but I do want to see  more listed employees on linkedin and then someone that is leading doing process development/scale up and quality control… quality assurance wouldn't hurt either.

It also looks like this company is casting a wide net of potential products, but it's entirely unclear if it has launched any of them. Hopefully it does. It feels uncommon these days for a company to go the IPO route so early on in R&D, most will look to do venture capital funding first to launch a few products. Is this an australian thing? Or is this just crowdfunding with extra steps? If you have more info, lets talk

I'm a materials science ape and don't know anything about Stock Market DD, but why not rely on science DD to decide on investments?

Is it not that always when another one of these messages comes out A LOT OF stocks are suddenly traded? And that when the price goes up \[and even down\] it is often a very controlled 40bucks a day?    


IF you still want to read more, let's look up that complete marketing campaign to bring the SHOP stock up again:   
First Shopify was compared with Amazon itself - which is laughable. Even Karl Marx knew already that capitalism tends to create a monopoly. Shopify ... by helping all the little and medium companies with their software is the exact opposite of Amazon. Not to mention that the malls are full again ... meaning fewer people will buy online than during the pandemic. Which at least in the short and midterm will bring online revenues down a bit.

Then Google mentioned some Google button that makes it easier to find Shopify customers. Well yes but that doesn't help Shopify results at all. AND it makes clear that Shopify customers severely lack visibility compared with an omnipotent Amazon.   
   
Then the Shopify payment system was hyped. Buy now pay later? REALLY? The """"have's"""" have credit cards and pay with them as they even get perks/payback and points for it. So who uses the buy now pay later system? The ""DO NOT HAVE's with only a half-decent credit score of course.

Sorry but when I read about this I was only able to imagine the Shopify payment system as a """"buy now pay NEVER"""" system and I certainly had no idea how this helps the Shopify stock in the long run. Do the revenue numbers go up in the quarterly results? What about liabilities? 

Then SHOP was mentioned as the ""stock to have"" in 2021 ?? Not even worth a comment. 

For me, the only thing that is ""poised to happen"" is that the pockets of the three leaving former executives of Shopify are filled and that the buying retail investors are screwed over in about 2 months' time with a two-digit percentage loss. 

And I write all this while I actually like the Shopify story, as I like Tesla and so many things that are happening with all these wonderful tech companies ...  
But IMO the SHOP stock goes back to $800 exactly as Tesla went down from 900\[intraday\] to now 600...

**○ 4.1 Orladeyo**™ **(Berotralstat) oral pill**

&#x200B;

Orladeyo is the ***first Oral approved*** treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with ***hereditary angioedema (HAE)*****,** disease which is estimated to affect ***1 in 50,000 people***

&#x200B;

\- Orladeyo was firstly approved in the ***USA*** ***December the 3rd,*** ***2020. Q4***

\- Orladeyo received ***Japan*** NHI price listing approval ***April the 14th, 2021. Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***Europe*** approval ***April the 30th, 2021 Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***UK*** approval ***May the 12th, 2021 Q2***

&#x200B;

***CEO*** himself Jon Stonehouse ***confirmed*** in the [last conference call, ( 22:15 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/) ***Orladeyo will annually*** be generating ***$500MM plus revenue.***

\-Serge Belanger ( ***Analyst*** ): I think in the past you've talked about ***sales potential for Orladeyo of 500 million plus***, are you still reiterating that target?

\- Stonehouse ( ***CEO*** ): ***Yeah make sure you remember the plus.***

&#x200B;

***Orladeyo*** is [ranked](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/20-most-expensive-prescription-drugs-in-2021.html) the ***#13 most expensive drug*** ***in the USA*** market. ***$37,308*** is approximately what patients must monthly pay to access the drug.

&#x200B;

***Before oral Orladeyo*** was approved for HAE, ***patients*** would only have treatments that required usage of ***needles***. This dramatically ***reduced the*** ***quality of their life***, making some of them quit using the treatment. That's the main ***reason*** why ***Orladeyo is a game changer***.

&#x200B;

As it's shown in[ the January 2021 Corporate Presentation](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16), Physicians expect to Prescribe ***Orladeyo for over 40% of HAE Patients.***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **4.1.1** **Pricings/Revenue**

&#x200B;

**USA**

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, ***7500 diagnosed and treated,*** 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for ***3,075 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to ***485,000$***

&#x200B;

**Japan**

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with ***Torii Pharmaceuticals.*** A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to ***at*** ***least reach 500 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to ***$248,500***

***Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment*** from Torii.

***BioCryst will receive*** tiered royalties ranging from ***20% - 40% of Japanese sales.***

&#x200B;

**Europe**

It's estimated to be around ***12,000 HAE patients in Europe.*** Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of ***4,920 patients*** in Europe.

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's ***$248,500/year.*** This number should soon be confirmed.

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

&#x200B;

\- ***USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$***

\- ***Japan - 500p x 248,5K = 124,250,000$***

\- ***EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$***

&#x200B;

Summing it all up we get $2,751,270,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of ***$2,628,170,000***. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

&#x200B;

* **4.1.2 Q1 EarningsReport Beat**

&#x200B;

On May the 6th, 2021 BCRX presented Q1 Earnings Report data which managed to ***Beat Analysts estimates***. Basically what matters from this ***Q1 ER*** is that it was the ***launch of Orladeyo***, and Analysts wanted to see a decent amount of money generated by it. They were expecting Orladeyo sales to top ***$3.1MM*** ***and Orladeyo actually generated*** ***$10.94MM***, this is a ***353% sales beat***

The consequence of the ER beat was an increase of ***24.06%*** in the ***SP***

&#x200B;

It's ***important*** to mention that ***revenues generated this Q1*** only came from the ***USA.***

This ***Q2 Orladeyo*** has been ***approved in Japan/Europe/UK*** aswell, adding new sources of revenue.

***Orladeyo sales*** are expected to ***grow exponentially*** each quarter. Main reason for it is that it has been approved in the countries mentioned above. The other reason is that the amount of ***patients*** they treat will slowly ***score up*** as insurance companies allow their clients to be treated with this drug.

&#x200B;

* **4.1.3 Orladeyo value**

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating ***$2,628,170,000*** a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier **x7**. We get a total of ***$18,397,190,000*** meaning an increase of ***$104,46*** in the stock price.

**○ 4.2 Peramivir** ™ **(Rapivab)**

Peramivir (Rapivab) is an antiviral drug for the treatment of influenza. Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. It is approved for intravenous administration.

On 19 December 2014, the FDA approved Peramivir to treat influenza infection in adults. Peramivir has also been approved in Japan and South Korea and is available in Japan as Rapiacta and in South Korea as Peramiflu.

The U.S. government (department of Health and Human Services) gave BioCryst Pharmaceuticals more than $77 million to finish the Phase III clinical development of peramivir. In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about $180 million to the program.

In 2013 the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current $234.8 million contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) peramivir.

&#x200B;

* **4.2.1** **Peramivir value**

With all the explanations given above and having in mind Peramivir is a government bio-defense drug the value of Rapivab can not be less than ***$500,000,000*** conservatively speaking.

&#x200B;

[Peramivir value: $2,84 SP](https://preview.redd.it/gc09kk81up171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e7fee79582328b95e4db5853fb52c5590dc8b55)

&#x200B;

**○ 4.3 Galidesivir - BCX4430**

Galidesivir (BCX4430) is a broad-spectrum antiviral in advanced development for the treatment of viruses that pose a threat to health and national security, including SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika.

The NIAID and BARDA have been funding the development and testing of Galidesivir for over 15 years as they recognize its importance in preparation for all future pandemics. The 31st of August, 2020 NIAID Awarded $44 Million Contract to Advance Development of Galidesivir.

Galidesivir has also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in vitro against more than 20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses in nine different families, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses. (Hepatitis C, West Nile, Dengue, Jap Encephalitis, Yellow Fever, TBEV, OHFV, and Zika), orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses..

Galidesivir is the first antiviral that has ever shown such potential, and to top it off, it is now known from the Phase I trial and now the Brazil part 1 trial to clearly be safe and show dose-sensitive effects in people. And based on multiple animal studies, it works equally effectively as a pill that is stable for years at room temperature. Not only that, but this antiviral, unlike any of the others, has excellent penetration of the blood brain barrier as was seen in the macaque Zika virus study.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.1 Efficacy**

Galidesivir was safe and generally well tolerated in Phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics trials by both intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy subjects. In animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits against a variety of serious pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika viruses.

The company on December 22nd announced that all three doses were perfectly safe for the patients. In addition, they found that patients had a dose-sensitive reduction in virus levels in their lungs. They went on to say that an animal model, showed that Galidesivir significantly reduced COVID-19-associated lung damage.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.2 Galidesivir value**

We must have in mind that Galidesivir is a Government funded bio-defense drug, that aims to treat a wide range of viruses as explained before. Its global stockpiling for future pandemics is also an absolute certainty given its long-term stability. With all the given explanations, conservatively talking Galidesivir can not be worth less than ***$1B this is 5,67$***.

&#x200B;

[Galidesivir value: 5,67$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/cylw2s73up171.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea63ebda1f07ddc72762ad137ec92ac17bb87f7)

**○ 4.4 FOP - BCX9250**

FOP is an ultra-rare, severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. Patients with FOP become bound by this irregular ossification over time, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP.

There are an estimated 3,500 to 9,000 patients worldwide, with 900 diagnosed so far. Currently there aren’t any approved treatments.

Market size for this treatment is estimated to reach 500M-900M in 2025, growing to 3B in 2028 as more patients are diagnosed. With a price ranging from $900K-$1M/year.

Last December the 21st Biocryst announced positive Phase 1 results

“BCX9250 was safe and well tolerated at all doses studied, with linear and dose-proportional exposure supporting once-daily dosing.”.

“In preclinical studies, BCX9250 demonstrated potency for the target kinase, selectivity, safety and strong suppression of HO in animal models.”

&#x200B;

* **4.4.1 BCX9250 Value**

BCX9250 study will most likely take 4 years to finish, this is, until 2025. By then the potential market we will be aimming for, will be $750,000,000 aprox.

Drugs that are in Phase 1 studies are said to have a 10% chance of making it to the market. Following that, BCX9250 as of now shuld be valued at ***$75,000,000 = 0.43$***

&#x200B;

BCX9930 is a novel, ***oral***, potent and selective small molecule ***inhibitor of Factor D*** which recently completed Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases.

The 3rd of August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ***Fast Track designation*** for oral Factor D inhibitor, BCX9930.

***This is how Bill Sheridan*** ( *Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President )* defined [BCX9930 in the last conference call ( 22:00 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/)

***""BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project, this is a potent specific Factor D inhibitor. So, the mechanism of action is to block the enzymatic activity of that complement enzyme, that enzyme sits at the very start of the alternative pathway of complement. So, that opens up a whole set of opportunities across diferent diseases that are driven by dysregulation of that alternative pathway of complement and the amplification loop that's embedded in that pathway""***

On March 22, 2021 BCRX announced that ***BCX9930 will be advancing from Ph1 to*** ***Pivotal*** ***Trials in PNH*** ***following the successful proof of concept trial.***

The company announced that a ***Pivotal trial for PNH***, and ***proof of concept trials*** in renal complement-mediated diseases are expected to begin in ***2H 2021.***

On March 22, the company unveiled BCX9930 ***Ph1 data***. The most relevant information from that Ph1 is mentioned below.

""***100%*** of treatment-naïve patients and **83%** of C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients were ***transfusion-free***. *Prior to the trial*, 22 percent of treatment-naïve patients and 17 percent of C5 inadequate responders were transfusion-free ""

Recently the FDA changed the ***primary end-point*** of the BCX9930 study, for it to be the ***change of Hemoglobin level from baseline***. The ***secondary end-point would be the % transfusion free rate reduction.***

This news ***greatly benefit BCX9930's study*** considering how it has ***showed the strongest results in those 2 mentioned study end-points.***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.4 Alternative Pathway**

What makes BCX9930 a game changer, is the wide spectrum of Alternative Pathway Dysregulation disease it can treat. It can treat up to[ 8 diseases](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 26) as of now, that's why insiders call it ***“Pipeline in a molecule”***.

* **4.5.5 Potential market size by 2025**

Assuming BCX9930 will be approved by 2025, and it will be able to treat the previously mentioned 8 diseases, we reach to the following conclusion. The potential ***market size BCX9930*** will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to ***$28,56B - $51B / year.*** This numbers are explained below, stating the yearly market size each of those 8 diseases aim for.

* **4.5.6 Alexion buy out**

On December the 12th, 2020 ***Alexion announced that AstraZeneca was going to buy them out for 39B***. More than ***90% of their revenue come from their “""""Factor D""""” C5 inhibitor,*** being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen.

You might think, why does this matter? Well, remember we have a Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion’s, and is able to treat more diseases than they do aswell. This buy out reflects how ***undervalued BCX9930 is.***

Apart from the buy out, I think it's essential to mention that ***Alexion bought Achillion's ""Factor D"" when it was in Ph2 for $930MM.***

In ***2019*** Alexion's SOLIRIS® (eculizumab) net product sales were ***$3,946.4 million***. Soliris is currently approved to treat ***PNH and aHUS***. Have in mind BCX9930 is able to treat 8 diseases, aiming for a wider market, while having greater efficacy/safety profile.

As a quick ***example***, using the average biotech mid-cap ***x7*** revenue multiplier, and the revenue ***Soliris*** managed to generate in 2019, ***3,964B = 27,748B***. It would mean a ***SP value of $157.56*** for ***BCRX***. I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in-class treatment and it's able to treat more diseases, therefore aims for a bigger revenue opportunity.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.7 Soliris/Ultomoris patients survey**

BCRX recently did a ***survey with 23 patients***, 12 of them using ***Ultomiris*** and the other 11 ***Soliris.*** The survey showed that ***91% of the patients were interested in switching*** due to the reasons explained in the pic below.

&#x200B;

Some of the ***patients treated with BCX9930*** were asked some questions, among them, the ***6th*** one expressed his ***desire to be able to be treated with BCX9930 oral pill.*** As we have seen it before with Orladeyo, patients are ***highly willing to switch from needles to oral-pill*** form treatments.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.8 BCX9930 From a Ph1 to a Ph3**

&#x200B;

On March 22, 2021 BCX9930 PNH Ph1 data was shown, the obtained ***results were so good that it enabled BCX9930 jump from a*** ***Ph1 to a pivotal Ph3 trial in PNH***\*\*\*, totally skipping the Ph2.\*\*\*

Additional ***proof of concept BCX9930*** ***Ph2 trials in Renal Complement-Mediated diseases*** will be made.

Straight ***jumping from a*** ***ph1 to a pivotal ph3*** trial, is something that's ***not common in the bio world*** and could be taken as a really ***bullish sign***. Apart from it being a bullish sign, it ***accelerates the process of development of the drug***, giving it a chance to ***hit the market in a smaller span of ti***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.9** **BCX9930 valuation**

Having in mind BCX9930 is a ***potential*** ***best-in-class treatment***, that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their “Factor D” c5 inhibitor, and the yearly market size BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the $28,56B - $51B mark. BCX9930 valuation can not be less than a ***30% of Alexion’s buy out price***, this is ***11.7B meaning 66.44$.***

&#x200B;

[BCX9930 value: 66.44$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/phh7inljup171.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2994d05aec97ea91d0e085ed352ce68ce2c217c)

&#x200B;

* **5. Strong BO Buy Out candidate**

As we have explained in the Institutional section before, all good bio-tech investors do know who Alexander ***J.Denner founder of Sarissa Capital*** is. After recently ***increasing his stake in BCRX***, along with BlackRock, he now ***owns a 5%*** of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Denner, has increased his position in BCRX by an stunning ***789% in the last 3 quarters***, showing ***strong conviction*** in the company.

Since Denner opened his position in Alexion, it took him 5 months to close the buy out deal, as shown in the picture below

After this exhaustive analysis on the company, we can easily acknowledge that BCRX is more than a ***strong BO candidate***. A buy out coming from ***BIIB***, company ***where Denner forms part of the BOD board of directors,*** would make total sense ***in the following 2 years*** once BCX9930 Factor D phase III data is unveiled.

It also is important to mention that ***Bank of America added BCRX to the list of top M&A candidates ( Mergers and Acquisitions )*** as of October 30th, 2020. Stating how they believe BCRX will have a ***strong revenue growth in the incoming years.***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **6. Alexion's performance with Soliris**

As we have explained before, Alexion Pharmaceuticals has its own """"""""Factor D"""""""" C5 inhibitor inhibitor called Soliris.

Alexion could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we could expect from Biocryst's in the incoming years. ***From 2007 to 2014 Alexion's stock price grew a 1777%***. Being valued at ***10.5$ in 2007 and 186.6$ in 2014.***

Revenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their Factor D was approved to treat additional diseases, and the market size it captured became wider.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6ix67squup171.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4bf5e078a9461e9e4c067833d7af2f9d802da8f

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals managing to do the SP move Alexion did, is more than ***doable*** with the unique pipeline it possess. Having in mind ***Alexion made 66.4 MM revenue the first year while BCRX expects to generate 500 MM plus with Orladeyo,*** apart from it, additional revenue generated by ***Rapivab/Galidesivir stockpillings*** may come. Incoming Earning Reports are meant to be potential catalysts for the company, gradually becoming more meaningful as the market size they capture with Orladeyo becomes wider.

&#x200B;

* **7.** **De-risked company**

Last December the 7th, 2020 BCRX announced they made a Royalty ***agreement with Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management.*** With this agreement BCRX was funded with ***$325,000,000 in order to support Orladeyo launch***. Setting the company in an attractive position of ***not needing to do any money rising ""Offering"".***

***Jon Stonehouse CEO***, also confirmed that the company will ***not need to do offerings anymore.*** The fact that the company is already generating revenue with Orladeyo is another strong evidence that confirms money risings will not be needed anymore.

It's important to restate that as part of the Royalty agreement, ***Royalty Pharma will receive a 1% on global net sales of BCX9930, if approved.*** Showing how ***bullish they are on BCX9930*** and their willingness to invest at it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gezetorvup171.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6880f64de595b224faf806b09f22385ba88dabf

&#x200B;

* **8. Forward looking statements**

&#x200B;

1. From now on ***EarningReports should be catalysts and positive for the company,*** obtaining better results each quarter as the company settles down and receives additional approvals for Orladeyo in different countries.
2. Orladeyo ***European launch.***
3. The company will have to provide some colour on the ***BCX9930 PNH pivotal trial***, how it will be planned etc etc... Aswell as the ***PH2 trials*** in complement-mediated diseases.
4. ***BCX9250 Next steps*** should soon be shared by the company
5. ***BCX4430 Galidesivir*** recently completed a Ph1, additional information about the study may be given. It's important to mention that this study was fully funded by the NIAID.
6. ***Galidesivir/Rapivab stockpilling.***

&#x200B;

*From now on revenues/BCX9930 updates are the main catalysts.*

&#x200B;

* **9. Conclusion**

After this exhaustive analysis, we come to the conclusion that ***BCRX is severely undervalued***, and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline, it should be valued around ***180$***. The StockPrice fair value number will keep growing as we keep getting data updates from the on-going studies and Orladeyo revenues keep growing, making it an ***excellent long-term hold and buy out candidate.***

I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range. My initial plan is to hold the shares for the long term, at least 2 years more provided that we don't get bought out earlier. I expect the StockPrice to keep rising as Orladeyo revenues flow in and BCX9930 trials keep progressing, aswell as the rest of the pipeline.",nmfr14,[],1

It is currently trading at Book Value (finviz, feel free to correct me on this), and is in the process of successfully deleveraging it's debt (rising stock prices would help with this process creating a virtuous cycle).

Ngl this seems like a prettt solid play rn low volume and it’s just been on the slow and steady rise 

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG’s Graphene and UQ’s patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

graph looks good. good buy. but if u want idk. not a professional buy at ur own risk. yeah.🚀.

Okay! Breakfast came early for You GMG.V Bulls. Its Pencil lead, not crayons today though, although Im hoping that someone with Market DD will post here in a bit and make us some fresh hot crayons. this is my first time on here doing anything like this, so go easy on me:

So here's some stuff I was able to get:

The only person with a science background That I can really find is their CSO:

Ashock Kumar Nanjundan CSO:

Pukyong National University

Degree Name: Doctor of Engineering

Materials Science

Current Adjunct professor at Queensland University (Gotta Do Something for the Kids Right)

Publications:

I’ll Let you guys go to sci hub to download this review for yourself, But the TLDR is that this dude knows his shit on how to dope graphene to get it to work as a battery.

Cited by: 178, For less academic Apes this means that 178 other scientists were like “yeah this dude knows his shit, Imma cite what he’s saying ~basically~ as fact.

https://doi.org/10.1039/C6EE00158K

Ashock’s most cited individual work comes from his first post-doc that he completed in Korea.

Polyaniline-Grafted Reduced Graphene Oxide for Efficient Electrochemical Supercapacitors.

Basically he does some pretty no-brainer synthesys to link graphene and another semi-conducting polymer that really enhances the graphene properties (Pretty nobrainer basic polymer bro shit, even so, it look like he probably wrote good supporting info and saved a lot of people a lot of time).

https://doi.org/10.1021/nn204688c

Total citations for all work combined: 3,845

This is pretty damn good for someone so young.

Here is a research paper that I'm having trouble accessing that seems to be relevant to this company's work on aluminum-graphene based batteries. If anyone can find it, DM me!

https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202010569

All in all, based on what I can see from linkedin about this company, they have a great CSO. He does seem to be both teaching and doing research in academia. He was recently brought up from a “Head Product Scientist” role to a CSO role, so hopefully this change will reflect a move away from more general research and towards really developing this stuff for GMG.V

I’m concerned about product development at this company, specifically it's unclear who is managing it. I’m not able to see every employee linkedin, but it may be that one of the people not visible is leading product development. You might be thinking ~but wait~ what if there is a group of slave PHD students/postdocs at the university of Queensland working on this stuff?  Yes there is. Nanjundan has some connections with the YU group (https://aibn.uq.edu.au/yu.)) And then here is a press release about it. (https://graphenemg.com/gmg-the-university-of-queensland-research-uni-quest-kick-off-the-graphene-enhanced-aluminium-ion-battery-development-project/)

It sounds like the company has recently had some really good results in R&D, but until I can see and Audit the product/process development lead, ill probably avoid going all in $$.

~sometimes~ the COO role at these companies can be a technical role that helps with process development, but the COO looks to be doing mostly operations type stuff and is non-technical. Not wholly worrisome, but I do want to see  more listed employees on linkedin and then someone that is leading doing process development/scale up and quality control… quality assurance wouldn't hurt either.

It also looks like this company is casting a wide net of potential products, but it's entirely unclear if it has launched any of them. Hopefully it does. It feels uncommon these days for a company to go the IPO route so early on in R&D, most will look to do venture capital funding first to launch a few products. Is this an australian thing? Or is this just crowdfunding with extra steps? If you have more info, lets talk

I'm a materials science ape and don't know anything about Stock Market DD, but why not rely on science DD to decide on investments?


Anyway yeah it seems like a solid play. It dipped a bit today but looking at financials i see nothing but greatness for this stock. not financial advice.

That being said, let's get down to business and what I have to say.

This month is going to be a wild ride. Volume is up 3x today and yesterday's volume was up 2x. This large volume and price movement could be the precursor to the second arm of a ""crab chart pattern"". Here's a crab and a chart to compare it to.

Left arm, body is completed, green brush is the right arm

Did you know crabs typically have one larger claw than the other? What this can be a metaphor for is that either the run we had was the big arm, or this next run will be the big arm. The green is my prediction of how the chart will look in the coming weeks.

It's impossible to confirm currently how large of a run this will be, but with how much institutional buying has happened and low short interest I can assume it will be much much higher. Likely blowing pasted the 28.76 mark into the $33+ range minimum. Retail and institutions are bullish, hold onto your shares tight.

8777,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"Hey all - I am a huge auto enthusiast and been following the industry closely. This is how I’m betting on EVs.

BB:
60 $30c 01/2022 at $0.27
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Already powering many of the telematics of current cars, BB is poised to benefit from their established relationships with big automakers. Getting certified with an automaker is not easy, so it is a barrier to entry for other companies wanting in on the action. Security and reliability are top of mind for these companies. You don’t want your car to get hacked easily, so what better than a cybersecurity company that happens to also do EV software, and already has experience with ICE cars. I did a long DD here 4 months ago and still stand by it: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


SONY:
100 shares at $101
🚀🚀🚀


I wouldn’t call this the Japanese equivalent for BB, as they aren’t a cybersecurity company. But Sony has a thriving consumer and B2B business that benefits greatly from consumer demand: the fact that they are literally selling every single PS5 they make is amazing and image sensors going out on many cell phones, including Apple using both image and lidar sensors from Sony. Great solid volume of sales to stabilize the company after some stagnant years.

On PS5, it’s actually a good thing that there’s a chip shortage. As Sony loses money on the hardware (and earn on game royalties and licenses), they are buying time to refine their manufacturing to lower costs, and lose less money on hardware sales. And because demand is so hot for the PS5, they are on track to build a bigger platform than even PS4 to charge 20-30% on every game they sell. That’s some fat margin.

Now, you’re probably wondering…wtf, I’m here to read about EVs, why you telling me about PS5s? Yeah, you’re right but a conglomerate like Sony is multifaceted. While they build up their EV software platform, they have cash cows in imagery and video games. And if Apple is really building an EV, I would bet (am literally betting) that they would rely on currently trusted partners like Sony for their imaging needs. You sit inside an Apple car and camera recognizes who you are and where you’re sitting? Well that’s probably a Sony camera…or 20 of them. There will be so many cameras inside and outside of any Apple car. I mean…my iPhone 12 has 4 cameras, and it’s a tiny slab of glass and my family can’t sit inside and drive down the road with others in the environment.

And when Japanese automakers get into EVs, they’ll look into a Japanese partnership. Guess who’s probably in pole position?

Full disclosure, I also have 150 AAPL.



VW:
200 shares @ $33.32
🚀🚀🚀🚀

You are all excited about Ford. I am too but I’m not buying into them because I think they are overhyped. But what’s interesting about Ford’s EV play is that they are partnering with VW to do so. That means…even if Ford can’t sell that many cars, VW will probably still benefit from joint research development and cost sharing. We also know how much more climate change is viewed as reality in Europe, and that’s VW’s home territory. VW already launching EVs under Audi, Porsche in the premium sector, VW, Skoda and Seat in the value sector, and Bentley and Lamborghini will likely have their ultra premium EVs soon.

But you might wonder…what about Tesla? They are so great! Well yeah they aren’t that bad. But VW is a goddamn monster. It’s kind of cute when Tesla announces a new plant, oh this is my 4th plant! We now have Shanghai and Fremont and building out Berlin and Austin. That’s cute. VW has 136 plants around the world. The economies of scale is insane and will be able to source materials for incredibly better deals. Oh and there’s that other partner called Ford who builds millions of cars a year also jumping into to beat on suppliers to give them both better pricing. Welcome to the big leagues, EVs.

VW is likely to launching 5-10 EVs per year, the equivalent the full Tesla line up every year. And they have Electricfy America network (and Canada) and similar in Europe.

And one more thing: VW also does trucks. Like 18 wheeler trucks. They are one of the biggest manufacturers, behind brands such as Man, Scania, and Navistar. And trucks have even more of a compelling business case for EVs…Will merge this part with Volvo.


Volvo:
800 shares @ $26
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Going to keep this briefer because this is already a novel. Now, when I say Volvo, I don’t mean Volvo Cars. That’s bought by Geely and yes they are making EVs under Volvo and Polestar brands. But I’m taking about AB Volvo, still out of Sweden, building trucks, mining equipment, backhoes, haul trucks and cranes.

EVs are so more more compelling because of the use and mileage they get. It’s not uncommon for a one year old truck to have a million miles. And as cities around the world clamp down on urban center access (congestion or polluter fees common in Europe, and allow EVs in for discount or free), EVs increasingly make more sense. You save so much on lower op/maintenance costs, avoiding tolls and tax credits. Oil prices will be going back up so saving on fuel costs is the smart thing to do.

Another thing is, governments around the world are spending trillions on infrastructure stimulus. What do these trillions buy? Concrete, steel, Volvo construction equipment, labor. Where does the concrete, steel and other commodities (like rising gold and silver prices) come from? They get mined out of the ground with big Caterpillar, Liebherr and Volvo equipment. Yep, there’s Volvo again!

So if you believe stimulus is happening, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe inflation is real, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe EV is the future for hauling shorter distances and/or heavy loads, Volvo is a good choice.

8781,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"Clearly, the company Shopify {SHOP} is in a market that is growing as it was showing before the beginning of the pandemic already -when the stock rose up to $500. I mean who doesn't believe in the internet here :-\]

During the pandemic, this SOFTWARE company helped a lot of smaller and midsize businesses as they were easily able to set up an e-commerce presence with Shopify's help. As a result, SHOP revenue increased a lot and the stock got propelled up to a crazy over 200 times forward earnings and a still to high current $$ 1240 price tag today. Yeah, that is my opinion only but Note: At the last press conference they said that operating cost will increase \[and by revenue increase will slow down\], THEY SAID IT - but nobody wants to hear it. 

You may wonder why to believe me if everybody can see that the stock price didn't fall back to a quite logic 60 times earnings \[like FANG Stocks for example\] ... meaning about 7-800 Dollars ...  

Well, SHOP was falling but then ...   
I can only assume that the three leaving executives teamed up with some other people who are interested in bumping the stock up again. Together they started an extensive press campaign, the one that we see even today: ""Shopify poised to go up"" I read today? Is it not that always when another one of these messages comes out A LOT OF stocks are suddenly traded? And that when the price goes up \[and even down\] it is often a very controlled 40bucks a day?    


IF you still want to read more, let's look up that complete marketing campaign to bring the SHOP stock up again:   
First Shopify was compared with Amazon itself - which is laughable. Even Karl Marx knew already that capitalism tends to create a monopoly. Shopify ... by helping all the little and medium companies with their software is the exact opposite of Amazon. Not to mention that the malls are full again ... meaning fewer people will buy online than during the pandemic. Which at least in the short and midterm will bring online revenues down a bit.

Then Google mentioned some Google button that makes it easier to find Shopify customers. Well yes but that doesn't help Shopify results at all. AND it makes clear that Shopify customers severely lack visibility compared with an omnipotent Amazon.   
   
Then the Shopify payment system was hyped. Buy now pay later? REALLY? The """"have's"""" have credit cards and pay with them as they even get perks/payback and points for it. So who uses the buy now pay later system? The ""DO NOT HAVE's with only a half-decent credit score of course.

Sorry but when I read about this I was only able to imagine the Shopify payment system as a """"buy now pay NEVER"""" system and I certainly had no idea how this helps the Shopify stock in the long run. Do the revenue numbers go up in the quarterly results? What about liabilities? 

Then SHOP was mentioned as the ""stock to have"" in 2021 ?? Not even worth a comment. 

For me, the only thing that is ""poised to happen"" is that the pockets of the three leaving former executives of Shopify are filled and that the buying retail investors are screwed over in about 2 months' time with a two-digit percentage loss. 

And I write all this while I actually like the Shopify story, as I like Tesla and so many things that are happening with all these wonderful tech companies ...  
But IMO the SHOP stock goes back to $800 exactly as Tesla went down from 900\[intraday\] to now 600...

Well, Good luck, give me your thoughts and I hope the bots even allow a huge and way too long posting like this.",nmdjep,[],0

Orladeyo is the ***first Oral approved*** treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with ***hereditary angioedema (HAE)*****,** disease which is estimated to affect ***1 in 50,000 people***

&#x200B;

\- Orladeyo was firstly approved in the ***USA*** ***December the 3rd,*** ***2020. Q4***

\- Orladeyo received ***Japan*** NHI price listing approval ***April the 14th, 2021. Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***Europe*** approval ***April the 30th, 2021 Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***UK*** approval ***May the 12th, 2021 Q2***

&#x200B;

***CEO*** himself Jon Stonehouse ***confirmed*** in the [last conference call, ( 22:15 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/) ***Orladeyo will annually*** be generating ***$500MM plus revenue.***

\-Serge Belanger ( ***Analyst*** ): I think in the past you've talked about ***sales potential for Orladeyo of 500 million plus***, are you still reiterating that target?

\- Stonehouse ( ***CEO*** ): ***Yeah make sure you remember the plus.***

&#x200B;

***Orladeyo*** is [ranked](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/20-most-expensive-prescription-drugs-in-2021.html) the ***#13 most expensive drug*** ***in the USA*** market. ***$37,308*** is approximately what patients must monthly pay to access the drug.

&#x200B;

***Before oral Orladeyo*** was approved for HAE, ***patients*** would only have treatments that required usage of ***needles***. This dramatically ***reduced the*** ***quality of their life***, making some of them quit using the treatment. That's the main ***reason*** why ***Orladeyo is a game changer***.

&#x200B;

As it's shown in[ the January 2021 Corporate Presentation](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16), Physicians expect to Prescribe ***Orladeyo for over 40% of HAE Patients.***

&#x200B;

* **4.1.1** **Pricings/Revenue**

&#x200B;

**USA**

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, ***7500 diagnosed and treated,*** 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for ***3,075 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to ***485,000$***

&#x200B;

**Japan**

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with ***Torii Pharmaceuticals.*** A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to ***at*** ***least reach 500 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to ***$248,500***

***Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment*** from Torii.

***BioCryst will receive*** tiered royalties ranging from ***20% - 40% of Japanese sales.***

&#x200B;

**Europe**

It's estimated to be around ***12,000 HAE patients in Europe.*** Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of ***4,920 patients*** in Europe.

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's ***$248,500/year.*** This number should soon be confirmed.

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

&#x200B;

\- ***USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$***

\- ***Japan - 500p x 248,5K = 124,250,000$***

\- ***EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$***

&#x200B;

Summing it all up we get $2,751,270,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of ***$2,628,170,000***. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

&#x200B;

* **4.1.2 Q1 EarningsReport Beat**

&#x200B;

On May the 6th, 2021 BCRX presented Q1 Earnings Report data which managed to ***Beat Analysts estimates***. Basically what matters from this ***Q1 ER*** is that it was the ***launch of Orladeyo***, and Analysts wanted to see a decent amount of money generated by it. They were expecting Orladeyo sales to top ***$3.1MM*** ***and Orladeyo actually generated*** ***$10.94MM***, this is a ***353% sales beat***

The consequence of the ER beat was an increase of ***24.06%*** in the ***SP***

&#x200B;

It's ***important*** to mention that ***revenues generated this Q1*** only came from the ***USA.***

This ***Q2 Orladeyo*** has been ***approved in Japan/Europe/UK*** aswell, adding new sources of revenue.

***Orladeyo sales*** are expected to ***grow exponentially*** each quarter. Main reason for it is that it has been approved in the countries mentioned above. The other reason is that the amount of ***patients*** they treat will slowly ***score up*** as insurance companies allow their clients to be treated with this drug.

&#x200B;

* **4.1.3 Orladeyo value**

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating ***$2,628,170,000*** a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier **x7**. We get a total of ***$18,397,190,000*** meaning an increase of ***$104,46*** in the stock price.

**○ 4.2 Peramivir** ™ **(Rapivab)**

Peramivir (Rapivab) is an antiviral drug for the treatment of influenza. Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. It is approved for intravenous administration.

On 19 December 2014, the FDA approved Peramivir to treat influenza infection in adults. Peramivir has also been approved in Japan and South Korea and is available in Japan as Rapiacta and in South Korea as Peramiflu.

The U.S. government (department of Health and Human Services) gave BioCryst Pharmaceuticals more than $77 million to finish the Phase III clinical development of peramivir. In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about $180 million to the program.

In 2013 the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current $234.8 million contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) peramivir.

&#x200B;

* **4.2.1** **Peramivir value**

With all the explanations given above and having in mind Peramivir is a government bio-defense drug the value of Rapivab can not be less than ***$500,000,000*** conservatively speaking.

&#x200B;

[Peramivir value: $2,84 SP](https://preview.redd.it/gc09kk81up171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e7fee79582328b95e4db5853fb52c5590dc8b55)

**○ 4.3 Galidesivir - BCX4430**

Galidesivir (BCX4430) is a broad-spectrum antiviral in advanced development for the treatment of viruses that pose a threat to health and national security, including SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika.

The NIAID and BARDA have been funding the development and testing of Galidesivir for over 15 years as they recognize its importance in preparation for all future pandemics. The 31st of August, 2020 NIAID Awarded $44 Million Contract to Advance Development of Galidesivir.

Galidesivir has also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in vitro against more than 20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses in nine different families, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses. (Hepatitis C, West Nile, Dengue, Jap Encephalitis, Yellow Fever, TBEV, OHFV, and Zika), orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses..

Galidesivir is the first antiviral that has ever shown such potential, and to top it off, it is now known from the Phase I trial and now the Brazil part 1 trial to clearly be safe and show dose-sensitive effects in people. And based on multiple animal studies, it works equally effectively as a pill that is stable for years at room temperature. Not only that, but this antiviral, unlike any of the others, has excellent penetration of the blood brain barrier as was seen in the macaque Zika virus study.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.1 Efficacy**

Galidesivir was safe and generally well tolerated in Phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics trials by both intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy subjects. In animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits against a variety of serious pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika viruses.

The company on December 22nd announced that all three doses were perfectly safe for the patients. In addition, they found that patients had a dose-sensitive reduction in virus levels in their lungs. They went on to say that an animal model, showed that Galidesivir significantly reduced COVID-19-associated lung damage.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.2 Galidesivir value**

We must have in mind that Galidesivir is a Government funded bio-defense drug, that aims to treat a wide range of viruses as explained before. Its global stockpiling for future pandemics is also an absolute certainty given its long-term stability. With all the given explanations, conservatively talking Galidesivir can not be worth less than ***$1B this is 5,67$***.

&#x200B;

[Galidesivir value: 5,67$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/cylw2s73up171.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea63ebda1f07ddc72762ad137ec92ac17bb87f7)

&#x200B;

**○ 4.4 FOP - BCX9250**

FOP is an ultra-rare, severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. Patients with FOP become bound by this irregular ossification over time, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP.

There are an estimated 3,500 to 9,000 patients worldwide, with 900 diagnosed so far. Currently there aren’t any approved treatments.

Market size for this treatment is estimated to reach 500M-900M in 2025, growing to 3B in 2028 as more patients are diagnosed. With a price ranging from $900K-$1M/year.

Last December the 21st Biocryst announced positive Phase 1 results

“BCX9250 was safe and well tolerated at all doses studied, with linear and dose-proportional exposure supporting once-daily dosing.”.

“In preclinical studies, BCX9250 demonstrated potency for the target kinase, selectivity, safety and strong suppression of HO in animal models.”

&#x200B;

* **4.4.1 BCX9250 Value**

BCX9250 study will most likely take 4 years to finish, this is, until 2025. By then the potential market we will be aimming for, will be $750,000,000 aprox.

Drugs that are in Phase 1 studies are said to have a 10% chance of making it to the market. Following that, BCX9250 as of now shuld be valued at ***$75,000,000 = 0.43$***

&#x200B;

**○ 4.5 Oral Factor D inhibitor - BCX9930**

&#x200B;

BCX9930 is a novel, ***oral***, potent and selective small molecule ***inhibitor of Factor D*** which recently completed Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases.

The 3rd of August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ***Fast Track designation*** for oral Factor D inhibitor, BCX9930.

***This is how Bill Sheridan*** ( *Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President )* defined [BCX9930 in the last conference call ( 22:00 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/)

***""BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project, this is a potent specific Factor D inhibitor. So, the mechanism of action is to block the enzymatic activity of that complement enzyme, that enzyme sits at the very start of the alternative pathway of complement. So, that opens up a whole set of opportunities across diferent diseases that are driven by dysregulation of that alternative pathway of complement and the amplification loop that's embedded in that pathway""***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.1** **Staff excitement**

Staff team from Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc seem to be really positive and ***excited*** about the incoming ***future of BCX9930***. Such excitement has been seen in the last conference calls where staff members such as the CEO Jon P.Stonehouse, or the Vice President, William P.Sheridan would say the ***following words.***

&#x200B;

***“Embarrassment of riches”***

***“We agree with Alexion that creating a potent specific and great oral Factor D inhibitor is a great challenge, and we are happy we have one”***

***“My only concern is i have no concerns”***

***“Pipeline in a molecule”***

***“My aim is to make c5 inhibitors obsolete”***

***“This is Big”***

""***BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project""***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.2** **Phase I study**

On March 22, 2021 BCRX announced that ***BCX9930 will be advancing from Ph1 to*** ***Pivotal*** ***Trials in PNH*** ***following the successful proof of concept trial.***

The company announced that a ***Pivotal trial for PNH***, and ***proof of concept trials*** in renal complement-mediated diseases are expected to begin in ***2H 2021.***

On March 22, the company unveiled BCX9930 ***Ph1 data***. The most relevant information from that Ph1 is mentioned below.

""***100%*** of treatment-naïve patients and **83%** of C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients were ***transfusion-free***. *Prior to the trial*, 22 percent of treatment-naïve patients and 17 percent of C5 inadequate responders were transfusion-free ""

&#x200B;

"" ***Hemoglobin levels increased*** by a mean of ***3.5 g/dL*** in treatment-naïve patients and ***3.2 g/dL*** in C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients; at last visit, mean hemoglobin levels were 11.8 g/dL and 12.2 g/dL, respectively ""

To understand properly how ***positive BCX9930 data was***, below you can find a photo that gathers the data from the main studies done in this kind of inhibitors. What mainly should catch your attention is the ***Hemoglobin change from baseline and the % of transfusion units reduction from baseline*** \- This data has been gathered by ***Barclays***.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.3  BCX9930 Study Primary End point change agreement with the FDA**

Recently the FDA changed the ***primary end-point*** of the BCX9930 study, for it to be the ***change of Hemoglobin level from baseline***. The ***secondary end-point would be the % transfusion free rate reduction.***

This news ***greatly benefit BCX9930's study*** considering how it has ***showed the strongest results in those 2 mentioned study end-points.***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.4 Alternative Pathway**

What makes BCX9930 a game changer, is the wide spectrum of Alternative Pathway Dysregulation disease it can treat. It can treat up to[ 8 diseases](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 26) as of now, that's why insiders call it ***“Pipeline in a molecule”***. Those ***8 diseases*** are shown in the pic below.

&#x200B;

1- PNH (Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)

2 - aHUS (Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome)

3 - ANCA vasculitis (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis)

4 - Lupus Nephritis

5 - IgAN vasculitis

6 - C3G (Glomerulonephritis)

7 - PMN (Primary membranous nephropathy)

8 - IgAN (IgA nephropathy)

&#x200B;

* **4.5.5 Potential market size by 2025**

Assuming BCX9930 will be approved by 2025, and it will be able to treat the previously mentioned 8 diseases, we reach to the following conclusion. The potential ***market size BCX9930*** will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to ***$28,56B - $51B / year.*** This numbers are explained below, stating the yearly market size each of those 8 diseases aim for.

&#x200B;

1 - 2 "" Due to COVID-19, the market for ***PNH and aHUS*** was anticipated to grow from US$ 4855 million in 2020 to US$ ***7023 million*** by 2026; it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.89% during 2021–2026.""

3 - “ ***Anca vasculitis*** prevalence in the USA rounds 10-20 per million = 3300-6600 patients. As a treatment example we use Soliris, which costs $500,000/year. We would aim for ***1,65B - 3.3B*** market size as of now. Expected to grow by 2025""

4 - “"" The global systemic ***lupus erythematosus*** market size is expected to reach ***USD 3.08 billion*** by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc., exhibiting a CAGR of 7.0% during the forecast period. ""

5 - 8 “""***IgAN.*** The gathered disease prevalence data varies according to in which coutry the study has been undergone. Data gathered from the undergone study in East Asia, show the prevalence rounds 45 / million. meaning 14,850 patients, or a potential ***7,25B*** market size using Soliris's yearly price ""

6 - ""***C3G:*** Prevalence in the USA round 14-140 per 1M people = 4620-46,200 patients. If those patients were to be treated with Soliris which costs $500,000 / year, the potential market size we aim for rounds ***2,31B - 23,1B*** ""

7 - "" ***PMN*** prevalence is similar to the one of IgAN, so we would potentially aim for a similar market size, meaning ***7.25B***""

&#x200B;

* **4.5.6 Alexion buy out**

On December the 12th, 2020 ***Alexion announced that AstraZeneca was going to buy them out for 39B***. More than ***90% of their revenue come from their “""""Factor D""""” C5 inhibitor,*** being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen.

You might think, why does this matter? Well, remember we have a Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion’s, and is able to treat more diseases than they do aswell. This buy out reflects how ***undervalued BCX9930 is.***

Apart from the buy out, I think it's essential to mention that ***Alexion bought Achillion's ""Factor D"" when it was in Ph2 for $930MM.***

In ***2019*** Alexion's SOLIRIS® (eculizumab) net product sales were ***$3,946.4 million***. Soliris is currently approved to treat ***PNH and aHUS***. Have in mind BCX9930 is able to treat 8 diseases, aiming for a wider market, while having greater efficacy/safety profile.

As a quick ***example***, using the average biotech mid-cap ***x7*** revenue multiplier, and the revenue ***Soliris*** managed to generate in 2019, ***3,964B = 27,748B***. It would mean a ***SP value of $157.56*** for ***BCRX***. I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in-class treatment and it's able to treat more diseases, therefore aims for a bigger revenue opportunity.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.7 Soliris/Ultomoris patients survey**

BCRX recently did a ***survey with 23 patients***, 12 of them using ***Ultomiris*** and the other 11 ***Soliris.*** The survey showed that ***91% of the patients were interested in switching*** due to the reasons explained in the pic below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6wsb9hchup171.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=d92b1a169e593a7ac3152237092e3efd8468ee70

Some of the ***patients treated with BCX9930*** were asked some questions, among them, the ***6th*** one expressed his ***desire to be able to be treated with BCX9930 oral pill.*** As we have seen it before with Orladeyo, patients are ***highly willing to switch from needles to oral-pill*** form treatments.

* **4.5.8 BCX9930 From a Ph1 to a Ph3**

&#x200B;

On March 22, 2021 BCX9930 PNH Ph1 data was shown, the obtained ***results were so good that it enabled BCX9930 jump from a*** ***Ph1 to a pivotal Ph3 trial in PNH***\*\*\*, totally skipping the Ph2.\*\*\*

Additional ***proof of concept BCX9930*** ***Ph2 trials in Renal Complement-Mediated diseases*** will be made.

Straight ***jumping from a*** ***ph1 to a pivotal ph3*** trial, is something that's ***not common in the bio world*** and could be taken as a really ***bullish sign***. Apart from it being a bullish sign, it ***accelerates the process of development of the drug***, giving it a chance to ***hit the market in a smaller span of ti***

&#x200B;

* **4.5.9** **BCX9930 valuation**

Having in mind BCX9930 is a ***potential*** ***best-in-class treatment***, that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their “Factor D” c5 inhibitor, and the yearly market size BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the $28,56B - $51B mark. BCX9930 valuation can not be less than a ***30% of Alexion’s buy out price***, this is ***11.7B meaning 66.44$.***

&#x200B;

[BCX9930 value: 66.44$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/phh7inljup171.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2994d05aec97ea91d0e085ed352ce68ce2c217c)

&#x200B;

* **5. Strong BO Buy Out candidate**

As we have explained in the Institutional section before, all good bio-tech investors do know who Alexander ***J.Denner founder of Sarissa Capital*** is. After recently ***increasing his stake in BCRX***, along with BlackRock, he now ***owns a 5%*** of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Denner, has increased his position in BCRX by an stunning ***789% in the last 3 quarters***, showing ***strong conviction*** in the company.

Since Denner opened his position in Alexion, it took him 5 months to close the buy out deal, as shown in the picture below

📷

https://preview.redd.it/of897ahmup171.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=abc2123461c38ce6d62c8320916416b87267db02

After this exhaustive analysis on the company, we can easily acknowledge that BCRX is more than a ***strong BO candidate***. A buy out coming from ***BIIB***, company ***where Denner forms part of the BOD board of directors,*** would make total sense ***in the following 2 years*** once BCX9930 Factor D phase III data is unveiled.

It also is important to mention that ***Bank of America added BCRX to the list of top M&A candidates ( Mergers and Acquisitions )*** as of October 30th, 2020. Stating how they believe BCRX will have a ***strong revenue growth in the incoming years.***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **6. Alexion's performance with Soliris**

As we have explained before, Alexion Pharmaceuticals has its own """"""""Factor D"""""""" C5 inhibitor inhibitor called Soliris.

Alexion could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we could expect from Biocryst's in the incoming years. ***From 2007 to 2014 Alexion's stock price grew a 1777%***. Being valued at ***10.5$ in 2007 and 186.6$ in 2014.***

Revenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their Factor D was approved to treat additional diseases, and the market size it captured became wider.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6ix67squup171.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4bf5e078a9461e9e4c067833d7af2f9d802da8f

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals managing to do the SP move Alexion did, is more than ***doable*** with the unique pipeline it possess. Having in mind ***Alexion made 66.4 MM revenue the first year while BCRX expects to generate 500 MM plus with Orladeyo,*** apart from it, additional revenue generated by ***Rapivab/Galidesivir stockpillings*** may come. Incoming Earning Reports are meant to be potential catalysts for the company, gradually becoming more meaningful as the market size they capture with Orladeyo becomes wider.

&#x200B;

* **7.** **De-risked company**

Last December the 7th, 2020 BCRX announced they made a Royalty ***agreement with Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management.*** With this agreement BCRX was funded with ***$325,000,000 in order to support Orladeyo launch***. Setting the company in an attractive position of ***not needing to do any money rising ""Offering"".***

***Jon Stonehouse CEO***, also confirmed that the company will ***not need to do offerings anymore.*** The fact that the company is already generating revenue with Orladeyo is another strong evidence that confirms money risings will not be needed anymore.

It's important to restate that as part of the Royalty agreement, ***Royalty Pharma will receive a 1% on global net sales of BCX9930, if approved.*** Showing how ***bullish they are on BCX9930*** and their willingness to invest at it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gezetorvup171.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6880f64de595b224faf806b09f22385ba88dabf

&#x200B;

* **8. Forward looking statements**

&#x200B;

1. From now on ***EarningReports should be catalysts and positive for the company,*** obtaining better results each quarter as the company settles down and receives additional approvals for Orladeyo in different countries.
2. Orladeyo ***European launch.***
3. The company will have to provide some colour on the ***BCX9930 PNH pivotal trial***, how it will be planned etc etc... Aswell as the ***PH2 trials*** in complement-mediated diseases.
4. ***BCX9250 Next steps*** should soon be shared by the company
5. ***BCX4430 Galidesivir*** recently completed a Ph1, additional information about the study may be given. It's important to mention that this study was fully funded by the NIAID.
6. ***Galidesivir/Rapivab stockpilling.***

&#x200B;

*From now on revenues/BCX9930 updates are the main catalysts.*

&#x200B;

* **9. Conclusion**

After this exhaustive analysis, we come to the conclusion that ***BCRX is severely undervalued***, and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline, it should be valued around ***180$***. The StockPrice fair value number will keep growing as we keep getting data updates from the on-going studies and Orladeyo revenues keep growing, making it an ***excellent long-term hold and buy out candidate.***

I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range. My initial plan is to hold the shares for the long term, at least 2 years more provided that we don't get bought out earlier. I expect the StockPrice to keep rising as Orladeyo revenues flow in and BCX9930 trials keep progressing, aswell as the rest of the pipeline.",nmfr14,[],1

 ""Below we have a snapshot of the current options volume in AMC. As you can see in the red box the days options volume is massive – and it heavily outpaces open interest. This is particularly true of the 25 and 30 strikes in which volume is near 150k for today.""

"" If traders are buying large amounts of calls, then market makers are short calls. To hedge these positions, market makers must buy AMC stock. Call buyers forcing market makers into purchasing stock is the essence of the options gamma squeeze.""

""To start the day our EquityHub options model was telling us that nearly 30% of total AMC gamma expired tomorrow, 5/28. We think that number shifts to 50% based on the wild volume taking place today. Because so much gamma expires tomorrow we think that AMC will likely consolidate as call options decay kicks in, which allows dealers to unwind some of their long stock hedge position.""

8816,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,Hello everybody. Does anybody of you know anything about a chinese trading app called hioxex exchange? It is kind of strange since I couldn’t find anything about them online. Did someone of you use the app in the past? I downloaded it and it seems professional but also kind of shady because you can’t find it on the app or play store. They have a working help desk but they don’t answer every question I have about them. I’m not sure if it is safe to trade or to put money on my wallet there. Maybe someone of you did already work with that app. I’m really curious about the origin of that trading platform. Any info would be helpful.,nmgrpf,[],0
8821,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"A financial opinion, not financial advice.

**TL;DR:** 

**Buy CHWY 06/11 75.5/76 Strangle**  

**Sell before market close on June 10**  


CHWY Earnings is June 10 AMC [Source](https://investor.chewy.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/Chewy-Announces-Fiscal-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results-Conference-Call/default.aspx)

As the earnings announcement gets closer, the implied volatility (IV) should increase. Now Vega--the greek responsible for the jiggle factor--reflects the option price's sensitivity to the change in IV. Higher IV means higher options price.   


IV:

* Last Earnings Call (March 30, 2021): \~75%
* Currently (May 27, 2021): 58.2%
* Difference: 16.8%

  
Options Contracts:

* 06/11 75.5P
   * Vega: 0.061
   * Current Price: $4.15
   * Expected price increase due to vega: (0.061 \* 16.8) = $1.02
* 06/11 76C
   * Vega: 0.061
   * Current Price: $4.05
   * Expected price increase due to vega: (0061 \* 16.8) = $1.02  


Total Entry Price: $8.20/contract  
Total Price Increase due to vega: $2.04  


Expected ROI: 24.8%  


Sell before June 10 market close. 

&#x200B;

Positions:

* CHWY 06/11 76C @ 4.05
* CHWY 06/11 75.5P @ 4.15  


The bid-ask spread touched me in my no-no square. Vega will help make it back.

8824,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"Okay so I only recently started trading (about a year) and really I’ve only used spare change. Using the app that shan’t be named (RH)I’ve put in 120, I’ve made over 200 on dogge and currently have about 431 invested. I’ve taken some profit out but really have just kept reinvesting. Now I have 70 in buying power and I think ripple looks good, thoughts? Also I have 3.99 shares in AMC at avg 5$ cost. Should I keep it in? So far my thought process has been to stay in cause I’ve already beat my overhead but it’s cost me...didn’t sell NKLA at 90 when I bought in at 10( that one really hurt) and sold my original dogge that if I had held onto would’ve made me 11k. I guess I’m just looking for some overall advice.

8834,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"With a rare natural gas price uptrend beginning right before summer, Commstock Resources is well placed to make a big move higher.

It is currently trading at Book Value (finviz, feel free to correct me on this), and is in the process of successfully deleveraging it's debt (rising stock prices would help with this process creating a virtuous cycle). Throw in its forward P/E of 7.36 and it looks very cheap in this most irrational of markets.

With NatGas prices charging higher we can expect to see a nice upswing in Commstock's beaten-down share price, as investors continue their rotation away from massively overvalued assets (TSLA, CryptCurrencies, etc) into deep value plays.

After the decimation of the US oil industry last year, CRK is also profiting nicely from their oil reserves. And with OPEC constantly pushing for higher prices, this will continue for the foreseeable future.

Short interest is currently at around 20% (finviz short number x 2, which seems to be correct). Options IV is under 40%. This is one of the last true value plays in the Energy Sector. The timing is right, come get some!

I only hold 80 shares, currently in the Red, but plan on buying more. Small fish in a big pond. So do you're own DD, cause I'm retarded!

TLDR:

$CRK go \^ when it stonking hot outside.

8835,2021-05-27,wallstreetbets,"TLRY has been cooling off since the January excitement. Good technical reversal spot. RSI is creeping up to squeezy levels. Their industry is projected to grow 30% every year for the next 10 years. So it's a good long term bet. It's also a good short term bet because it gets really nice big spikes. I'm in this position. Exits for me are laid out in the chart. Assuming I reach a TP I will exit part of the position and then when it cools off for another month or two I will enter again when the technical setup looks good. I plan on doing this a couple times a year for a few years if this pattern keeps up. 

Good luck to all.

# TA Notes: 

* Bulls broke the small 419.64 test that was listed in prior posts. Found support until SPY tested 20 SMMA . We got a nice green candle after close 👀.
* However, SPY still could not break 421.

# TA Notes:

Theta has caused a rinse and repeat of targets the last three days.

* if 420.73 breaks, look for bullish 🎯 : 422.43 - 423.81 - 425.15
* If 417.25 breaks, look for bearish 🎯 : 416 - 415 - 414.13 - 412.74 - 411.26 - 410
* Please not that if we push below 415 we could see downwards pressure to 405.
* **Best case for bulls is that we gap above 421 tomorrow.**
* **Best case for bears is we gap below to fill small gap @ 419 and test new resistance.**
