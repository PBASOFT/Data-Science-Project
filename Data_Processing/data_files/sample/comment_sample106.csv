at the end of those two weeks, it slid down to $1.11 and it didn't seem like it would stop sliding (the latest news about it at the time didn't sound promising), so i got out.

Heres a list of their portfolio: http://aprubrands.com/portfolio-2/
So yeah you're correct their sparkling juice, Apple Rush, is listed on their applerush site. Used to be on Amazon and Walmart but it stopped being restocked due to a couple of reason. I believe the sparkling juice is still being produced - just not avaiable online.

Instead the brand started shifting focus to their CBD infused water. Element C is the main one, few others in the works:
https://element-brands.com/
Big selling point is they are all natural and acutally tastes good vs other CBD drinks.
This is where the hype is, they've introcuded it a lot of trade shows, distribution is growing all the time (have a look at their twitter https://twitter.com/RealAPRU_NEWS).
Bit of a small press release from today may give you an insight:

I don't understand why you are bashing a company for the fact that they didn't get something done yet, that they are actively pursuing. 

Have you ever started a business and gone through the process of building relationships and negotiating deals? I can tell you from multiple experiences that no matter how perfectly you prepare, there will always be something unexpected which will force you to adjust plans, adapt, and overcome. This is what separates successful businesses from failing ones. 

On the OTC, especially pinks, you invest in speculation and potential of deals/plans/contracts etc etc. I brought you information BEFORE the big spike in price happens, should FOMO Corp succeed in executing their plans. The 4MM funding was the last piece necessary before this current deal closes.

In the mean time, taking all those shares out of trading volume will actually decrease the average daily volume, as the float is likely pretty small. Float means actual shares being traded, and not in some long term hold with company insiders or institutional investors. As that daily volume goes down, the price will keep going up and up and up. It will not take long until they would have to start buying at 1 dollar, 2 dollar, 10 dollars, etc. (share price being mostly a function of supply and demand)

This is why hostile takeovers are rare, and for often seen in more liquid companies, but even then they do occur they often do not get 50%+1 at the market. They often get 15-20% as use that as leverage over the company/board to force them to agree to a offer.",[],0

Then go to Yahoo finance and go to the financials tab of the company and pretend like you know what the numbers all mean.  Stare at the company's balance sheet untill your eyes cross. Then look at insider ownership.  If you like the sound of the names of the owners, that's great.  If they have strong names like ""Bill"" or ""Carl"" or ""Vinnie"" that's great.  If they sound weak like ""Kyle"" or ""Tucker"" don't invest.

Just keep repeating until you find a company you can convince yourself that you believe in.  It's more important that you believe in the company than the company actually be a good company.  That way when it dips you won't sell.

(((selling price) \* \~75% ownership ) - \~10% Closing Costs) / shares

140k acres is a lot, so it'll probably be somewhat difficult to move all of them together, so they might take a price lower than 40k.  So, let's just assume 10k/acre for a lowball estimate.  Also, there is no tax on the on the sale, since it's university lands (don't ask me, it's just what I've read).

(140k \* 10k) = 1.4B

1.4B \* .75 = 1.05B

1.05B - 105M = 945M

Have you ever started a business and gone through the process of building relationships and negotiating deals? I can tell you from multiple experiences that no matter how perfectly you prepare, there will always be something unexpected which will force you to adjust plans, adapt, and overcome. This is what separates successful businesses from failing ones. 

On the OTC, especially pinks, you invest in speculation and potential of deals/plans/contracts etc etc. I brought you information BEFORE the big spike in price happens, should FOMO Corp succeed in executing their plans. The 4MM funding was the last piece necessary before this current deal closes.

Float means actual shares being traded, and not in some long term hold with company insiders or institutional investors. As that daily volume goes down, the price will keep going up and up and up. It will not take long until they would have to start buying at 1 dollar, 2 dollar, 10 dollars, etc. (share price being mostly a function of supply and demand)

This is why hostile takeovers are rare, and for often seen in more liquid companies, but even then they do occur they often do not get 50%+1 at the market. They often get 15-20% as use that as leverage over the company/board to force them to agree to a offer.",[],0

(((selling price) \* \~75% ownership ) - \~10% Closing Costs) / shares

140k acres is a lot, so it'll probably be somewhat difficult to move all of them together, so they might take a price lower than 40k.  So, let's just assume 10k/acre for a lowball estimate.  Also, there is no tax on the on the sale, since it's university lands (don't ask me, it's just what I've read).

(140k \* 10k) = 1.4B

1.4B \* .75 = 1.05B

1.05B - 105M = 945M

945M / 144M Shares = **\~$6.50/share dividend**.

This is an interesting alternative to the solid-state lithium-battery race that is currently going on. However, it won't be able to compete for capacity and solid-state WILL be able to recharge faster than todays batteries, though maybe not THIS fast.

Worksport's Bed Covers Charge EV Pickup Trucks from Ford, GM, Rivian and Atlis
Mentioned:	AAPL F GM NKLA TSLA WKSP
The first wave of EV pickup trucks is on the horizon and is anticipated to take over the automotive industry in the U.S.

Last week, Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) previewed its new electric F-150 Lightning pickup, a relatively inexpensive electric version of the most popular vehicle in America, during a visit by President Biden. Ford had taken 20,000 reservations in less than 12 hours since the truck was officially unveiled.

Other major contenders like GM (NYSE: GM), Rivian, Atlis, Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are also set to release their EV pickup trucks on American roads soon.

Although there are plenty of pros to owning an EV pickup truck, range anxiety is a common concern among many.

To get the maximum EV range possible, the concept of adding solar panels to tonneau covers or truck bed covers seems like the natural next step. But, this hasn't materialized in production yet.

See also: How to Buy Ford Stock

Worksport (OTC: WKSP), a tonneau cover market leader, provides solutions for forthcoming EV pickup trucks with its proprietary technology √¢¬Ä¬î the TerraVis√¢¬Ñ¬¢ system.

About TerraVis√¢¬Ñ¬¢ Solar Cover System

The TerraVis solar tonneau cover system consists of four monocrystalline foldable solar panels that have an output of approximately 1kW.

The system should be able to add 12 to 15 miles (20 to 24 km) of range to an electric pickup truck, which is 30% of the power needed for the average daily commute under optimal conditions.

The company has already forged original equipment manufacturer (OEM) supply partnerships with two EV Truck nameplates, one of which is in partnership with Nissan.

The TerraVis system is expected to cost less than 5% of the overall cost of a pickup truck. Furthermore, TerraVis is in development now to give current pickup truck owners access to EV tech without investing in a new truck and to further leverage the power of their electric truck in the future. It is a future-proof product that truck owners will bring as they upgrade and expand with more modular storage.

Not a One-Trick Pony

The TerraVis√¢¬Ñ¬¢ system's application is not just limited to extending the mileage of EV pickup trucks.

The battery system, Terravis 'Cor' can also be touted as a mobile power plant. The system will take power from the cover and store it in modular battery packs √¢¬Ä¬î storing 1.5kWh of energy in up to four batteries. This can be stored and transported in the truck's bed using the TerraVis√¢¬Ñ¬¢ mounting system.

The batteries can power almost anything with its built-in 2kWh power inverter from the job site or campsite which can be used in the event of a natural disaster or power outage.

The unique feature of the battery system is that it can be available for purchase as a standalone consumer product √¢¬Ä¬î even if you're not a truck owner.

Massive Potential

Worksport has been around for over a decade and has been successful with its lineup of five unique truck bed cover models. The company has an intellectual property portfolio of over 30 assets of utility patents and trademarks.

The company competes in many multibillion-dollar markets. The EV market is estimated to increase to $30 billion by 2030. This value may be much more than what is estimated with rumors about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) joining the bandwagon with its first generation of EVs. According to The Korea Times, Apple is close to signing an agreement with LG Magna e-Powertrain. If the agreement were to take place, we could expect a prototype to be teased in early 2024.

The specialty-equipment market has a market value of over $12 billion as pickups alone account for over 25% of the market. The other big markets include the tonneau cover market ($600 million), the battery storage system market ($2.9 billion in 2020).

With the cumulative size forecasted over $24 billion by 2025, Worksport stands a chance to generate revenue over 1.5 billion, assuming a 5% market share. The company's market stretches beyond just the U.S., into Canada, Latin America, Australia and more.

Worksport currently has over $10 million in cash and cash equivalents and no long-term debt. In February 2021, the company closed its oversubscribed Reg-A offering, raising $4 million. To date, the company has received over $2.9 million from the exercise of warrants associated with its Reg-A offering and has also raised an additional $3 million from non-brokered Private Placement.

'TerraVis is the culmination of Worksport's effort to look beyond our core business producing the highest quality tonneau covers for all truck owners,' said Steven Rossi, CEO and founder of Worksport. 'We're dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what a truck accessory can offer, and to do so, we are looking to the future of EV trucks to bring that technology one step closer to today's truck owners. Our solar-powered tonneau cover will allow anyone to generate and store power for use in their daily life √¢¬Ä¬î work and sport.'

Take for example a ‚Äúholding company‚Äù that focuses on say, cookies.  They don‚Äôt make cookies.  They don‚Äôt sell cookies.  They own other businesses that might make or sell or market or write blogs about cookies.  Or eat cookies.  There is no guarantee it‚Äôs not some dude sitting in his garage selling stock in a non existent business (can you say HPNN - Hop-on Industries?)

-

That said, it‚Äôs not always the case.  Sometimes a holding company is like the federal government, it oversees and directs its subordinates (states) and acts as master control.

-

But then there is the fact that this one is in China.  Read up on other Chinese stock.  PUDA (Puda Coal) - CEO executed for fraud, Luckin Coffee - CEO now trying and failing to run a noodle shop after falsifying sales records and manipulating stock (delisted from NASDAQ or NYSE or whatever happened...  went from like $50 to $1 in the span of a week?  I forget exactly)",[],0

To a new reader it would appear as though there is nothing else to look at based on your comment which is why I was upset.

This offering is just the icing on the cake for a company that owns a very disruptive technology in a very competitive environment. The closer you look at the tech, the more the offer starts to make sense imo.

$SBFM

A couple plays to keep an eye on this week:

$HNRC - Put out a shareholder letter today saying they have enough assets to by worth almost $10/share. Currently sitting under $2.

$TAWNF - Court date is Friday, shareholder vote for the restructuring plan passed last week. From what I hear, the court thing is just a formality, but in either event if the judge signs off on the plan, this could go to the moon Monday.

$CERPQ - There's a merger coming down the line, no date yet but people have been loading up.

$PTOP - I watch too many stocks, there could be a merger coming, a reinstatement I don't remember but people are loading up at these levels.

$NNRX - Reinstatement

$GOFF - Sharp got custodianship of this today, hence the 2x spike. Interesting to see how high this is gonna go.

$AVVH - Their updated address as Gold Quest Group, LLC. Possible merger in the works????

$RLBD - Will be upgraded to Pink any day, possibly this week.

$FMNJ - Updated to Pink (yesterday?). Shareholder out today, basically says they're busting their balls trying to get value to the shareholders.

$GEGI - Started reporting tonight after 4 years. Could be a gapper.

$RRRT - Partnership with Langers Juice Company.",[],0
