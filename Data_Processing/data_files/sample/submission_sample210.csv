180,2021-05-22,stocks,"As you may know, BABA has been fallen 30% since it's high in October.  But their financial are just too good.  I spoke with several Chinese people yesterday who are living and working in China.  I wanted to get a feel for what the situation is on the ground, how they see the economy, future and thoughts on BABA/Jack Ma.


BABA Has 5 Operating Segments


China Commerce (65%): Segment revenues are derived from retail e-commerce and associated marketing services in China.


China Wholesale & Other (12%): Segment revenues are derived from wholesale commerce and logistics services, primarily driven by Chinese consumption.


Cloud Computing (8%): Segment revenues are derived based on customers' duration and usage of Alibaba's service.

International Commerce (8%): Segment revenues are derived from retail and wholesale operations as well as from advertising services outside China.


Digital Media & Innovation Initiatives (7%): Segment revenues are derived from content subscription, software subscription and merchant advertising offerings.

Alibaba (BABA) is one of the largest companies in China.  It's hard to truly understand everything they do, as they are involved in just about everything.  When Chinese pay for something, they don't use credit cards.  They use either WeChat/WeiXin (Tencent) or they use Alipay (BABA).  Nearly every Chinese person has these 2 apps on their phone.  It is essential.

----------
View from China

In speaking to Chinese people, as I have done for years, you have to understand everything is always going to be optimistic. From TV news to social media ""influencers"", the government is always sending messages to the people about how great...everything is and how not to trust outsiders.  So at first everyone was overly optimistic and diffused any thoughts I had of negative impressions.  This was to be expected.  As you dig further traces of truth open up.

First, China has done a decent job of getting the virus under control...but it's not as far a the US.  The population is so large it is going to take a full year from today to get 70% vaccinated.

These vaccines are less effective than what the US has.  They are in Phase III trials of their own mRNA vaccine which should be better.

Tourism won't come back this year as China is requiring everyone to have taken the Chinese vaccine to enter china as the moment.  

There is general optimism but I would call it cautious optimism.  The economy seems to be holding well, virus seems to be holding well...but many fear this could fall apart if something goes wrong.  

BABA

When asked about BABA and Jack Ma everyone heard about the fine paid by the company.  The said China is trying to crack down on monopolies and thus considered Alibaba as such.  All remain positive about Alibaba and Jack Ma but understood the government wants to protect the people.

What they think will happen?

Many felt Alibaba will continue to do well, but due to China's warning to them about Monopoly, they feel Alibaba will slow it's pace of growth.  Either intentional or mandated, this wasn't sure.  Alibaba can not continue on the same path forever.  It will not be allowed.  The fine was a warning to them.  Next step would be much drastic (prison for executives, company take over).  

---

Conclusion

Chinese are optimistic on their economy and Alibaba but with caution.  

I better understand the drop in BABA now.  It's not about how great they were in the past, but the fear of what will happen if they continue this way...and realistically they can not continue.  
A few speculated that the company will now be more controlled by the government but this is speculation.

Every time a stock is “supposed to go up” but isn't there are always people claiming the market makers and shorts are ruining it. The say the shorts are idiots and will soon get fucked.

Did you know that retail investors can short stocks? It's not that hard to open up a margin account. Of course there are also put options but that has other variables and risks and not every stock has options. Have you ever thought maybe you're the idiot for buying a stock that's way up or overvalued instead of shorting it? Either don't take the risk of shorting or don't buy when a stock is inflated. Stop bitching about market manipulation and shorting. Maybe your stock isn’t going up because it has no revenue and already gained 200% on speculation the company has the next cure for cancer.

This is just the aftermath of meme stocks and a huge bull run. People think they can make easy 100% gains consistently.

I've decided to start a private fund, hire them as employees so to speak, and teach them everything there is to know about economics, finance, the markets, trading and of course; accounting and tax law. The dining room table is getting replaced by open cubicles, workstations (2 monitors each to start, then 4), a large bookshelf and a giant dry erase board on the wall. Maybe a couple of large screens on the wall too later on. During ""work hours"" they aren't allowed to have their cell phones or go to any websites not work-related. 1-2hrs a day will be personal instruction, time for required reading, time for market news, time for instructional videos (hand-picked YouTube channels), time to practice with virtual/paper trading sites, and I'm also going to require them to each be enrolled in 1 college class at a time here locally relevant to what I want them to learn.

***My question to the community, what are the top must-read books and best websites for virtual trading?*** I'm looking for the recommendations that are currently considered to the best in their topic. 

I want them to have exposure to everything from currency arbitrage and commodity futures to stocks/bonds plus learning all forms of trading like leverage and shorting, etc. I want them to know about everything out there and how it all works so over the years they can practice and get better at each aspect.  I'd consider them rookies until year 3-4 at least. After that, hopefully, they would have started to figure what type of traders they may want to be and start getting more specialized. I'm a swing trader for example that also does medium to long-term fundamentals trading, plus a ton of other stuff. 

My goal is to hand these boys the world on a silver platter and teach them how to turn those plates into gold so to speak. I'll be personally funding them out of my own pocket when they are ready.

He taught me a lot as I was growing up and I've been trading since I was 16. Now I want to see if my sons wish to carry this on.

The Metaverse, Web3, and the Inevitability of NFTs

NFTs are here to stay and will be foundational to our new world 

Earlier this week, I explained how NFTs became so popular — seemingly out of nowhere.
IMO, NFTs are not a fad.
They’re not only here to stay as a new form of digital art, but they’re also going to a foundational technology for how the world will operate in the future.
It may sound like I’m being over-dramatic, but I assure you that I’m completely serious on that statement.
NFTs’ astronomic rise was the culmination of the initial innovation in 2017, the steadily established infrastructure of exchanges & wallets, and macro tailwinds.
It’s the last bucket of macro tailwinds that ultimately led me to become super bullish on the future of NFTs.
I firmly believe two trends will shape the world in the next 10–15 years:

The Metaverse, and its proliferation on all aspects of society

Web3 and the democratization of the Internet

And the arrival of both trends will firmly rely on the technology of NFTs in order to be successful.
Let’s double click on each.

What is the Metaverse?

The Metaverse has a lot of varying definitions.
From Wikipedia, the Metaverse is described as a “collective, shared virtual space that is created when the physical realm converges with the virtual realm, which includes virtual reality, augmented reality and the internet.”
Author Neal Stephenson coined the term in his 1992 sci-fi novel Snow Crash. humans in the form of avatars interact with each other in a 3D world.
The term comes from the words “meta” — meaning “beyond’ — and “universe”.
So the Metaverse is an extension of our current existence.
Think of it as another virtual world that lives in parallel to our physical world — a world that we can freely access through the internet and compatible hardware devices.
The most popular depictions of the Metaverse in popular culture are Spielberg’s 2018 film, Ready Player One, and Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over.
And while the Metaverse can be seen as a game, it can also just be another plane of existence — where we can interact with one another.


Tron Legacy is a popular Metaverse depiction as well

The Metaverse is Inevitable

I believe that we’re rapidly moving towards a world where the Metaverse is not only real, but an integral part of our everyday lives.
Before you call me a crazy conspiracy theorist, hear me out.


The ethos behind the Metaverse is the creation of a digital space for us to live, socialize, and work — that transcends the space-time of our physical world.
Doesn’t that sound a little like… a Zoom meeting? Or a FaceTime with friends?
Or even a thread on Twitter? How about a game of Fortnite with friends — while talking on Discord?

During the pandemic lockdown, many of us have been forced to find social connections digitally — whether it be through video calls with friends, or for work using Zoom.
For me personally, I’ve a lot more time on Twitter, establishing connections in the tech and crypto spaces there.
This has led me to realize that activities that I had previously done IRL can now be ported to the digital realm: working, networking, socializing.
And that doesn’t mean there’s no room for IRL meetups. In-person relationships will still be important — especially in the year coming out of the Covid pandemic travel restrictions.
But it isn’t hard to imagine our world moving towards this direction — given all the trends I’ve outlined so far.

What is Web3?

Before we define Web3, we have to get a strong understanding of what Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 are.
Web 1.0 was the period time describing the advent of the Internet. When the World Wide Web was still a widely used term, and the dial-up sound was a common and unwelcomed occurrence.
Here, we had the initial surge of interest in e-commerce — leading to the eventual dot-com boom. We also had the first wave of internet browsers like Netscape and messaging platforms like AOL.
The term Web 2.0 was coined by O’Reilly and others between 1999 and 2004 — the early years post-Web 1.0.
Web 2.0 catapulted the world from simple static desktop web pages designed mainly for news — to interactive experiences, user-generated content, and marketplace economics that brought us NASDAQ giants like Uber, Facebook and Twitter. Web 2.0 was mobile-first, social-first, and cloud-only.

Web 2.0 unlocked trillions of dollars of value for the global economy, but in doing so, we — as consumers — gave up a lot of agency over our lives, in favor of the value of the services that a handful of companies provide us.
Today, we suffer from the consequences of that trade-off: handing over our individual freedoms in favor of centralized services.
Our every move is watched by the big tech companies: where we browse, where we shop, and even we are located in the physical world. They use this information to sell us products and nudge our behaviors to benefit their ultimate customer: the advertisers.
More on this dilemma is expertly covered in the Netflix doc The Social Dilemma.
Moreover, we allow these companies to house our information — leading to a single point of failure in the advent of a security breach.
We’ve had our personal and financial information exposed in the Target and Equifax hacks a few years back — with seemingly no repercussions from our governments.
This will continue in perpetuity in an arms race between black-hat hackers and security experts.
As a result, we’re entering a new era of the internet: Web 3.0 (or Web3) for short. An era that champions open, trustless and permissionless networks.

“Open” — meaning built on open standards, by an open and accessible community of developers and executed with full transparency

“Trustless”— meaning in that participants can interact with the comfort that all information is correct and authenticated — without needing to trust a third-party to verify

“Permissionless” — meaning that no one can be barred from participation, even from an authority figure like a government

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchain protocols are the driving force behind the Web3 movement — with the vision of an open financial system in which anyone can build and participate without using gatekeepers like traditional financial institutions.

NFTs are Digital Ownership

Let’s think back on the two topics we just discussed: the Metaverse and Web3.
In the Metaverse, people have a secondary digital life, in which they can earn money and spend their leisure time in — unbounded by the restrictions of the physical world.
But if the Metaverse were to exist in a Web 2.0 setting, large centralized institutions like Facebook and Google will only the experience — living in their data centers that can be shut off by their whim, and gathering the data of our lives in order to sell for profit.
Imagine if your whole digital life lived on Facebook and you were only fed news that Facebook wanted you to see. If you said something in the Metaverse that Facebook didn’t want you to see (i.e., in concert with an authoritarian government), they could shut off your entire livelihood — akin to deleting an Instagram account if that account constituted your entire digital life.
If you’re going to live a sizable chunk of your existence in the Metaverse, you may as well have ownership over those digital items.
With Web3, end-consumers take back the ownership of their own data. Instead of forgoing their data and their privacy to the big tech companies, they’re able to control their own data — living in a cryptographic, decentralized mesh of computers that combine to become a distributed data center rivaling GCP and AWS.
Instead of Facebook owning your digital home, you actually own it. And you own the digital land on top of it. And all of your digital furniture.
And you’re able to do so with the power of NFTs.
NFTs cryptographically prove that you, and you alone, are the owner of your digital items. And no one else can take them away from you.


Source: Bloomberg
So now I’m a true believer of NFTs, but not because of its application as art.
Yes, NFTs have cracked the problem of digital scarcity, enabling creators for the first time ever to accurately price and safely distribute their works.
And yes, as a result, NFTs allow artists to monetize their work in a new way, empowering them to cut out money-grubbing middlemen and forming direct relationships with their supporters and fans.
But frankly, I don’t care about art — never have. That’s probably why I was so remiss to embrace NFTs in the first place.
Everything clicked together when I realized that inevitability of the Metaverse and Web3.
NFTs are the bridge between the two movements — a way to allow for open, trustless, decentralized ownership of the Metaverse.

521,2021-05-22,stocks,"Hi all, I’m hoping I can get some advice on how to actively manage my stock watchlist. Without getting to deep, I am primarily a US stock swing trader with a small (~5k) portfolio, though I also invest a good portion of my $$ into ETFs & lower risk/reward funds. I work part time and it’s lucrative enough to pay the bills and give me a bit of extra $$ to invest. 

I’ve been splitting my spare time between learning and trading. My strategy up to this point has been creating a spreadsheet of ~120 companies who’s charts I check every 1-3 days (depending on momentum of the trend), and never go longer than 2 weeks without checking a company’s chart. I spend 4-5 hours on weekdays reading charts & news, and journaling my arguments as to which way companies will move.

 However, I am starting to get a bit burnt out because I am constantly seeing new tickers, news, and significant movement within different market sectors. I am having trouble connecting all the dots and organizing information for the companies in my watchlist. I believe they all have merit, but I am getting overwhelmed trying to keep track of all the moving parts within. Right now, I use TD to trade & paper play, TradingView to chart and journal, Excel to keep track of my watchlists & when to check. I also use website like the S&P heat map, an economic calendar, and greed/fear gauge for news & overall market observation. I also use a trading discord but only listen to people I know are informed & reliable. 

I guess I feel overwhelmed by my strategy’s time frame / deadlines and the amount of potentially pertinent information I receive. I’d be grateful to hear from anyone with similar experience or understanding that could offer any tips, tricks, or advice in general.",niq4dv,[],0

638,2021-05-22,stocks,"I just finished watching a video by former hedge fund manager Lars Kroijer. In the video, he explains how risk-averse investors with a long time frame should invest only in global markets. This strategy leads to maximum diversification. 

I gather that this risk minimizing effect as a result of diversification also leads to less exposure of swings in currencies (when buying instruments in currencies other than that of your home countrys). However, if you live in country A with currency A, and buy a world tracker instrument in country B with currency B, will this cancel out the diversification effects, as my purchase would now be subject to swings between currency A and B?

Example:

\- Citizen in Denmark that has a local currency DKK  
\- Buys *iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF* (due to low 0.20% expense ratio) in USD

Would the above person cancel out the positive effects of diversification in regards to currency swings because he would now simply be subject to DKK/USD swings? Or is the entire premise wrong?",nir5xo,[],0
647,2021-05-22,stocks,"A bit of research of one of my newer positions of my portfolio. Take all of this with a grain of salt. I am not a financial professional. I'm barely a Finance student (but I will be this Summer), Graduated with an International Business degree, and decided to double major and get a degree in Finance from 2021-2022 for personal reasons mostly. Having said that, here is my Bull Case for Camping World Holdings:

Overview: Camping World Holdings benefited in both the short and long term from the pandemic due to the lockdown creating a larger market for it's signature products, RV's, camping supplies, and other outdoor recreational products. With two consecutive years of warm seasonal pandemic swings occuring, Camping World Holdings has been in the position to capitalize and increase its Earnings Per Share drastically over the last 2 years. Despite this, the stock is still trading at a PE ratio of 8.47, despite its recent wave of earnings justifying a price of over twice it's current price of 40, as it's 5 year average justifies the stock trading at a PE Ratio of 20.47. With another pandemic summer occurring with another round of stimulus checks in many people's pockets, and with potential post-pandemic economic growth, CWH is in a position to benefit from it's recent growth and continue to deliver strong earnings into the next few years. CWH is also starting to emerge as a sneaky dividend stock, as it has recently increased its quarter dividend from .23 a share to .25 and has a current dividend yield of  2.5%, which is above average in its industry. 

Pros:

Trades at a very attractive valuation currently: It's currently trading at a PE ratio of 8.47. Over the last 5 years it's Earnings have been consistent with a PE ratio of 20.47. At it's current share price of just under 40 dollars a share, this stock is very undervalued in my opinion as both a growth and a value stock. 

Starting to emerge as a dividend stock: The market median for a dividend stock in its industry is a yield of 2.28%. With CWH's recent dividend hike, their yield is reasonably above this median at 2.5% and is likely to grow higher in the future. 

Q2 Hype: CWH is set to report 2nd Quarter earnings on the 3rd of August, a good bit of time from now, but it has high expectations to live up to. The current Low/High ranges between 8 Analysts range from 1.77 to 2.65 per share. Having said that, there's no reason to think that CWH won't deliver. It beat it's Q1 estimate average of .70 by 1.40 a share, and the upcoming hot weather mixed with pent up stimulus spending is likely to help this company into the next Quarter. Regardless of the Earnings outcome, hype around this quarter is likely to drive up the price as the earnings date comes closer due to speculation. 

Cons:

Traits of a Cyclical Stock: CWH runs the risks of other stocks with cyclical traits. While I believe there is enough short term substance to pent up stimulus spending and access to cheap debt to justify a short to medium term recommendation, for long-term investors the stock may be prone to cyclical downfalls.  Seeing as a large part of their revenue stream is RV repairs, and current RV sales growth will mean more RV repairs down the road, I think the cyclical nature will somewhat even out. 

High Q2 Expectations Mean High Volatility Risk: If the stock fails to deliver relative to what's priced in during Q2 earnings, the stock might take a dive. Anyone who may need this money within the next few months might not want to deal with the potential volatility. 

Conclusion:

I believe Camping World Holdings is great as both a Value and a Growth stock and has the potential to be a strong performer for years to come. Already trading at a great valuation and poised to benefit from a post-pandemic economy with extra stimulus money to be spent, I believe this is a great stock to own at it's current price point, and to pick up during a dip for any medium to long term value/growth investor.",nir9b6,[],1

885,2021-05-22,stocks,"Just last Friday, May 14th, Tellurian CEO Octávio Simões was Appointed Chairman of the U.S. Chamber’s U.S.-Korea Business Council. On Friday, May 21st, South Korean President Moon Jae-in met with President Biden where steps were taken to reinforce economic cooperation between the two countries. Tellurian quoted the tweet stating “TellurianLNG ready to support this cooperation 🇺🇸 + 🇰🇷with #USLNG from Driftwood $TELL #LNG”.

This tweet may be a tease but we all know what they’re trying to tell us. South Korea was the top country for US LNG exports in September 2020!

What is Tellurian?

Tellurian was founded in 2016 by two industry icons, Charif Souki and Martin Houston. Charif set in motion the first liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from the United States Lower 48 and founded Cheniere Energy. Martin originated the concept of LNG destination flexibility, ensuring that LNG became a commodity. 

Tellurian is currently a debt-free company!

What is LNG?

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been cooled down to liquid form for ease and safety of non-pressurized storage or transport. It takes up about 1/600th of the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state. LNG is odorless, colorless, non-toxic, and non-corrosive.

When LNG is returned to its gaseous state, it is used across the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors for purposes as diverse as heating, cooking, generating electricity, and manufacturing a wide variety of products. LNG is also used as a fuel for heavy-duty and other vehicles.

Who is Charif Souki?

To put it in simple terms…Charif Souki is the Elon Musk of LNG.

Charif co-founded Tellurian and serves as Executive Chairman of the Board. He also founded Cheniere Energy, Inc. in 1996 and served as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President until December 2015. Prior to Cheniere, Charif was an investment banker. He serves on the board of trustees of the American University of Beirut and as a member of the Advisory Board of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Charif received a B.A. from Colgate University and an MBA from Columbia University.

Charif Souki was the highest-paid CEO in 2013; this proves that he’s the real deal. Charif Souki was voted out of his position at Cheniere by Carl Icahn. Charif Souki was fired because he wanted to expand Cheniere with projects such as Driftwood whereas Carl wanted to spend their cash flows on dividends. Carl Icahn to date has never met Charif Souki in person.

Charif Souki resurrected his Driftwood plans by co-founding Tellurian. 

What is Driftwood?

Driftwood LNG LLC, owned by Tellurian Inc., is developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production and export terminal on the west bank of the Calcasieu River, south of Lake Charles, Louisiana. Once complete, the terminal will be able to export up to twenty-seven million, six hundred thousand tonnes of LNG per year to customers worldwide.

The team at Tellurian together accounts for 75% of the LNG export from the USA today. In 2020; 5281 BCF of Natural Gas was exported from the USA. At current JKM (Asian Market) prices for June 2021, that is equivalent to around $37,508,302,500. At current TTF prices (European Market) prices for June 2021, that is equivalent to around $32,161,290,000. These numbers tell you that the team at Tellurian is no joke and should not be taken lightly. 

The President & CEO of Tellurian, Octávio Simões brings 38 years of impressive energy industry experience to Tellurian’s remarkable infrastructure team. Previously, he was President and CEO of Sempra LNG & Midstream where he was responsible for all LNG and natural gas midstream activities in Sempra’s efforts to develop, build and operate liquefied natural gas (LNG) receipt terminals, liquefaction facilities, natural gas pipelines, and storage facilities. He led the company’s efforts at Cameron LNG, Energia Costa Azul LNG and Port Arthur LNG, where he focused on reliability of deliveries to customers, safety and gas sourcing strategies that assure reliable production of LNG. Octávio has deep relationships in the LNG market and an unmatched tenacity for developing new projects.

Martin Houston the Vice Chairman and Co-founder is also an LNG veteran with nearly 40 years of experience. He’s managed all forms of enterprise in the energy industry, has established a strong external reputation in the international gas business, and is largely credited with being the key architect of BG Group’s world-class LNG business. In recognition of this, in 2011 he was the first recipient of the CWC LNG Executive of the Year award.

Why hasn’t Driftwood started construction yet?

The Driftwood project will cost $27.5 Billion including pipelines. Driftwood will produce 27.6 MTPA of LNG. Tellurian has been looking for Equity partners to help with the funding of Driftwood. Tellurian currently has one equity partner which is TOTAL SE. If FID for Driftwood isn’t reached by June 2021 then TOTAL can choose to back out of their position. If they choose to exit, it won’t be an issue for the company as Charif Souki “said building the terminal is no longer dependent on the Total agreement.” Tellurian currently has all permits required for Driftwood and Charif Souki confirmed that they are intending on starting basic construction this summer and planning on giving Bechtel the green light to begin full construction early next year.

What’s going on with commercial agreements?

In a recent interview with Citi Group, Charif Souki stated that ""We want to finish our commercial agreements, which will happen in the next few weeks,” Souki said the offering has been very popular and, if Tellurian hits its target in the next few weeks, would be oversubscribed.

A recent video targeting Short Sellers was posted by Tellurian. Charif Souki asked the shorts “What do you think is going to happen when we start announcing some of these long-term commercial agreements that we’ve been working on for so long? This will be an interesting question and we will see how the market reacts when this happens.” - We are the market and it’s our time to react.

Our Friends over at Citadel decided to buy Puts for TELL 🤦‍♂️ - How many times do we have to tell them not to mess with us 😤

Is TELL a quick trade or a long-term hold?

Charif Souki has made it clear that he is building a business and that TELL is not a trade. If you just want quick profits then this stock is NOT for you! 

Tellurian’s Competition:

Although no one in the US will be able to come up with a business model more profitable than Tellurian’s Driftwood. Qatar in many people’s eyes is seen as a big competitor and one that will destroy all US LNG exports but this is simply just not the case. Countries that import LNG diversify their “LNG portfolio” and will buy from a variety of countries and not just anyone in particular. No matter how profitable Qatar’s LNG plan is; Success is almost inevitable for TELL. Charif Souki personally talked about this and with utmost respect reassures us that Qatar is not a competitor. 

Stock Price📈:

Tellurian themselves have implied that the TELL stock will have a value of $12-$17 at FID! TELL is currently trading for $2.62! In the Citi Interview, Charif Souki said that the stock will have $7 FCF in a couple of years! The multiple for the FCF is decided by the market… but is usually around 10x+!🚀🚀🚀

Institutional Owners: - https://imgur.com/a/ssYRYfP

The top 3 institutional shareholders for Tellurian are State Street Corp, Blackrock INC & Vanguard Group INC! State Street Corp recently disclosed that they added 20,783,999 shares adding to a grand total of 23,481,581 Shares. Blackrock and Vanguard own upwards of 13 million shares each! Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street don’t invest in companies that they don’t believe in. They believe in Tellurian and have proved it with the positions they have.

Why am I invested in Tellurian🦍🦍🚀🚀?

I am invested in Tellurian because I believe in the business model and also believe in the team. Charif Souki is a very intelligent man and Tellurian’s weekly “2 minutes with Charif” videos keep investors up to date about what is going on with LNG throughout the world along with the occasional updates about Driftwood. $TELL has been through a lot these past few months but we have been setting high lows and higher highs last week which makes it appear as so we are in the “c” or correction wave according to the Eliott Wave Theory. The fundamentals of this company haven’t changed and things are only getting better.

TELL Positions-  https://imgur.com/a/QjvCx4J

I am long TELL as you can tell by my positions. 

TL;DR - Tellurian teased their agreement with South Korea earlier today and TELL is basically in a correction. The announcements of commercial agreements will help the stock reach a fair value. This is not your regular start-up company as the team has a shit ton of experience. With a highly profitable business model along with big connections in the business; Tellurian is lined up for success and is just waiting for the perfect time. Carl Icahn a short seller caused the highly respected Charif Souki to be fired from his own company and shorts are betting against his new company. It’s time to crumble the shorts. It’s time for the bulls to takeover!

While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals® (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

· IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration – Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) – Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) – Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it. 

The chicken shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:    [Chlorinated chicken explained: why do the Americans treat their poultry with chlorine? | Analysis & Features | The Grocer](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/food-safety/chlorinated-chicken-explained-why-do-the-americans-treat-their-poultry-with-chlorine/555618.article) – The US Poultry Industry chlorinates chicken as a part of the disinfection process. 

This dependency on chlor alkali to fight COVID isn’t just happening in America. Below are links to numerous countries around the globe using chlorine and chlorine based products heavily to fight COVID.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.
