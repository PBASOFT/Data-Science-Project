Are you someone who wants to know about programming more generally and prefer structured lessons with an expert helping you along from the beginning? If so then find a python course on udemy or youtube and start following along.

Are you someone that just wants to know python thats specific to algotrading but still prefer structure? Then find an algo-specific course that shows you how to interact with your chosen broker/api.

Do you just want to jump in, and prefer learning only what you need? Then jump in, and be prepared to Google things frequently (and often using different terms until you become more fluent in the metalanguage specific to algotrading and python). 

We live in an age where all of these options are on eqyal footing - it's entirely up to you and which you believe will suit best.

For reference I fell into the third category. I know so.e basic c# stuff from using Unity, and have a good understanding of basic programming concepts such as variables, loops and if/else statements. Since I just wanted to get stuck into it, I found a basic tutorial on YouTube that showed how to use IB_Insync. I didn't watch the whole thing, just enough to get the basic idea and where I could find official documentation. 

From there it was a ton of googling. Seriously, so much googling! My first bot iteration took about a week to make, and I was able to have it running on paper trading all last week. 

I still have lots of tweaking and some quality of life additions to make, but at least that gives you a rough timescale for someone of my ability* with my preferred learning style. 

* I should also mention that I've been daytrading for a few months on my own, and so already knew what strategy I wanted to try and automate - I wrote it in psuedocode first (basically plain English) so all I had to do was learn how to implement exactly what I wanted to do.

Without further knowledge of that space, I would argue that the word ""amateur"" is not very compatible with ""high frequency"" anymore.

To answer your question, there are mainly 2 types of brokers. Those that charge you and those that don't charge you commissions. Those that don't - will most likely be selling your data to the real high frequency firms that will be able to front run your order any moment, any day of the week.

So, while creating an algorithm that bases itself on low profit margins and timeframes, you need to account for the fact that the slippage is most likely gonna be bigger than you might have calculated (or didn't calculate) and it might even turn out that paying the fees for transactions is better than paying the invisible fee of being front-runned

I operate with interactive brokers that are generally considered to have pretty good and fair order execution, but they do have transaction fees. 

I think it's up to you to calculate the real cost of your transactions in both cases and you'll most likely have to operate your algorithm live for a while to be able to know that.

And with such algorithms, you need to be absolutely sure with your calculations and your testing, as I can see you probably already inserted some biases in the development, judging by the ""depending on how I adjust the parameters"".

106,gz5f3kh,2021-05-23,t3_nj3zga,algotrading,"Great project! It seems 90% similar to something I‚Äôve been building recently.

I like your approach of checking across all coin pairs. This is one of the biggest advantages of trading algorithmically, but chronically under-utilised (at least from what I‚Äôve seen on this sub).

Pausing the whole algo in a bearish market is great, I‚Äôve been missing something like this in my project so it‚Äôs cool to see how you‚Äôre determining it.

How are you implementing trailing stop-losses? Binance don‚Äôt offer ‚Äúnative‚Äù TSLs for Spot trading, so are you just cancelling and re-placing pending orders in response to price movements? That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve done it, it works reasonably well, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind a cleaner solution.

One thing worth exploring (when you have backtesting in place) is your stop-loss, I see on GitHub it‚Äôs at 3%. You may be surprised (I certainly was) to find algos like this, in a bull market, perform more efficiently when you remove the stop-loss entirely. If you can afford to keep a position open for a few days, this often works out better than setting a stop-loss at e.g. 50%, and *also* better than triggering too frequently (like at 3%). Certainly something worth playing with!

110,gz5h3hs,2021-05-23,t1_gz59n22,algotrading,"Is there anything you'd like to know specifically? I've put a few general helpers below...

**The Binance API has a few quirks.** Their API documentation is OK, but could definitely do with some improvement. Make sure you read *the entire documentation*, as there are many ""gotcha"" caveats scattered throughout. You'll inevitably run in to a random API issue sooner or later, spend hours debugging, only to find the explanation is hidden in some changelog note from 2 years ago. Additionally, some fields in the API itself have typos, which will obviously be difficulty to change for backwards-compatibility. 

**They're not very receptive to community improvements.** Frustratingly, Binance's dev team seem a bit resistant to suggested improvements. There's plenty of documentation fix PRs on GitHub, correcting mistakes in their API docs, but Binance typically just reject or ignore them (despite being useful improvements). This is kinda frustrating as you lose faith in being able to trust their documentation.

**Don't use** `quoteOrderQty` **when placing orders.** You can place orders by specifying *either* a single `quoteOrderQty` field, or *both* `quantity` and `price` fields. I would always recommend using the `quantity` and `price` fields (where you specify a quantity of the *base* asset, and the price you would pay for it ‚Äî rather than the *amount* of the *quote* asset you're willing to spend to receive the base asset).

(This is just my opinion, there may be times when `quoteOrderQty` is advantageous, but I prefer to go the ""long way around"" as it reduces the risk of errors, makes accounting and finance easier, and ensures both buy and sell sides of a transaction are measured identically, making it much easier to track your performance.) 

**Postman is extremely helpful**. Import the [Binance Postman Collections](https://github.com/binance/binance-api-postman), it makes development and testing significantly easier!

**Use** `DECIMAL(24,8)` **data types for storing symbol snapshot values in an SQL database**. If you're storing volume for symbol snapshots, expect up to 16 figures before the decimal place. Ensure all price values are saved up to 8 decimal places too.

**Don't use** `float`**!** Use decimal/string values, in conjunction with a scientific math library, to ensure calculations are accurate when working with quirky crypto values.

**Each symbol has different order rules**. If you're trading across multiple symbols, you'll need to know the different symbol ""filters"". These filters are rules for each trade, and specify minimum quantities, minimum notional values, min/max percentage changes, and units of ""step size"".

**You should validate every order before placing it**. Binance has an endpoint at `/api/v3/order/test` ‚Äî use it! You can `POST` any order request to it, and it'll throw an error if the request fails any of the symbol or exchange filter rules. If it succeeds, you won't be charged, but know you're ready to place the order for real ‚Äî and are far less likely to encounter errors when you do so.

**POST/PATCH API calls can be kinda slow**. If you're trying to do *really* high-frequency trading, expect 1-3 seconds for an order to submit. Add more time if you validate the order first (recommended).

**Testnet data is really weird**. Don't expect Testnet data to be ""realistic"" in any way. You won't be able to run backtests on Testnet data, I think they just use a random number generator to create pseudo-random prices. There's also a much smaller range of symbols available than on the live exchange. Testnet data changes often and without notice, so whilst it's not at all useful for trading, it is good for weeding out unforeseen bugs in your code.

If you‚Äôre using stop-losses in volatile conditions, even if it‚Äôs a stop-limit order, it can get skipped over if the price drops fast enough. I would set up a monitoring process to watch any pending stop-losses periodically, if the price drops below the stop price and the order didn‚Äôt trigger, bail out with a market sell (or set another lower limit, as you see fit).

45 trades a day sounds like a lot for one symbol, you‚Äôll be picking up a lot of noise in the data and likely trading too often. Not to say it‚Äôs not possible to make a profit, but I imagine your margins will be very tight, and you‚Äôd need a big budget. Higher order quantities mean harder fills. Perhaps consider setting your buy/sell indicators a little stricter so you trade less often, but more reliably. 

I‚Äôm speaking from experience here, I used to think ‚Äúmore buy signals = more profit‚Äù, but over time realised it was just bringing my strategy‚Äôs results closer to a coin toss, and masking where my true edge really was. Expect lots of trial and error, but be cautious of overfitting. And like everyone always says here, what works in a bull market might be completely different in a bear market.

You can use OCO orders if you want to simplify entering/exiting a position. Whilst OCOs can be useful, I personally found building my own trailing stop-loss implementation, combined with careful polling of my outstanding orders, to be more profitable.",[],1

I know this is gospel wisdom in algorithmic trading circle, but I'd like to offer an alternative thought (please feel free to disagree with me).  


Signals should only be combined if they were developed in unison, and the low correlation between backtests might not be as significant as you think going forward. Any time I took a bunch of uncorrelated strategies and made a portfolio out of them, they ended up having high ""crash beta"" -- which is exactly what it sounds like.. i.e not good. Often times when they did hedge one another it was totally incidental and I couldn't rely on it.

&#x200B;

For me, nirvana only came when I started building signals in unison. Now all my strategies purposefully execute multiple trades simultaneously to reduce risk of any one trade.

268,gz88jda,2021-05-24,t3_njlx75,algotrading,"FIX is a standardized protocol used in financial markets. Benefits include the ability to code up one FIX library which can then be easily adapted cross multiple counterparties with small tweaks. Generally there are standard tags (1=Account #) which further helps quick implementations. A framework exists for 'heart beats' to make sure connectivity is still active even without orders. Think about a fund who has 10s to 100s of connections / brokers and you can see how this quickly becomes useful.

In terms of speed - there won't be a clearcut answer on improvement as it would really depend upon the broker you're interacting with. Messages via both with proprietary API and FIX will likely need to be translated (ex: to exchange native). It's possible this is done more quickly on the FIX side because of less load on their servers, less hops, more optimized translation, etc. Anything actually latency sensitive would not use FIX; it's way too slow.

The $1,500 you are quoting would be for dedicated connectivity. It's likely more stable and potentially faster, but it's really dependent upon what you're doing and how the broker is setup. Ex: Connect in NJ.. maybe okay for US equities, but not so great for CME futures. 

At the 1min frequency the 300ms should not make or break the strategy. Also be thoughtful in how you're measuring your latency. Think about how delayed the data is when you get it, how long your message takes to get to the broker (acknowledged), how long the fill comes after the ack, your processing time, etc. You may find one of these steps is taking a lot longer than it should and can be easily fixed with less effort than porting to FIX.",[],0

Stable success over long period above market returns isn't ordinary, and you have to be extremely talented to get it.

The market is highly motivated to be the hardest problem on the planet. It's very accessible and becomes a zero sum game around the market return. For every gain you make, you create a direct incentive for someone to disrupt that gain.

There are some things that ML can do better, but building a robust taxonomy is not one of them.  

Elite wave is difficult to backtest also because you have to determine entry and exit points in such a way that doesn't give you false positives based in other edges.  I.E using a stop loss of only a few ticks, and a profit target of 10 points is such huge gap, that this alone can skew the visibility of the real edge you are testing...

I was thinking of two approaches to detecting Elliot waves. One was to train a recurrent neural network on pre-labelled Elliot Waves that ""Ellioticians"" as you call them have already labelled. I don't know of such a dataset but I would be it exists somewhere.

The other was similar to what another commenter said about creating a rule based forward walk algorithmic that uses peak/valley detection and looks for Golden ratios between peaks/valleys that satisfy the EW rules.

The questions that came up were:
How much margin of error should be used when checking the ratios of segments of the wave?
What should the bounds be for the timescale?
How to make such a forward-walk rule based algo computationally efficient?

I know some institutions use each bid, ask and closeing as a data point for HFT, but that is not my short-term plan.

Well a bayesian approach would derive the mean, variance, and probability from past readings, something akin to the state transition matrix you might have used in Markov process. But with the bayesian approach, you could follow the dominant trend and use the variance bands as stochastic forces. Just like in Brownian motion where the force is a constant in random directions, with bayesian you could have a variable force and variable direction, the direction being a combination of dominant trend and force derived from past probabilities. It is a very high-level and a bit unformed concept and something similar to what I am working on for my thesis. The issue I see of applying this to crypto is the volatility of crypto the probability distribution of the 'force' is too wide. You can surely make profitable trades but not optimized trades.

2. Let's say the current NBBO for the asset is X for bid and Y for the offer.

Nbbo rules, orders are sold to internalizers not routed to market so you're getting a better execution compared to the DISPLAYED liquidity which is all that matters.

HFTs are incentivized to get the most order flow, they do this by providing the best price improvement to the broker.

Also, an inherent problem with RL is, it works optimally on known cases ie the data pattern or trend it has seen in the past. Which generally due to stochasticity wouldn't  be as optimal.

Another reason is the issue of the changin environment and action space choices.

Generally in RL the environment is stable meaning and the action choices has the same outcomes in almost all cases. In case of stock market when the agent moves to a new state the environment changes drastically, say if the stock is at all time high or has a very steep rise it wouldn't have optimal strategy then. In short, the movement of the agent would change the environment itself and consequently the rules of the environment. Also there is no guarantee that the learned strategy is an optimal one as everytime you train the strategy changes slightly and in a stochastic environment it can have a cascading effect.

1. The time frame of the algorithm is critical. Their first major advance and first time they made money, was because the took their existing approach and changed from making long term predictions to making short-medium term predictions
2. Gathering as much data as possible and then developing algorithms that can leverage as much of that data that is useful, by combining the signals in some way. This implies to me a form of ensemble learning or possibly reinforcement learning, and having a really good way of estimating the accuracy and reliability of each signal
3. Effectively managing bet size as well as timing is critical
4. Knowing when to exit a position is critical, taking a profit or minimizing a loss
5. Cutting trading and execution costs to a minimum is very important. They outline how a bug in the code was costing them a tonne of money until it was removed by a new engineering hire, IIRC. Their edge per trade is tiny, so cutting costs while maintaining a large transaction volume is how they make a lot of their money.
6. Moving to a single underlying algorithm across different instruments allowed them to concentrate on making one really good model vs a number of mediocre ones.

The best way is to stream the ticks and write or use a technical indicator library of your choice to get what you want. Since the candles are based on 'binning' of executed orders values within a particular timeframe, there's a high probability that your and Binance indicators would not match when your measuring time is small. If you trust the tick data and if you are sure of all the default parameters of a 'ready-made' indicator, then you should trust the indicator values.

But for modelling, complexity could be better. For example order book models. You dont want a naive algo that gives surface level replication. I worked on an algo that looked at how orders would affect order book, and needless to say the naivety caused failure lol. So a model should be complex enough to capture the microstructure.

In a zero fee world, I don't think this realistically happens anymore. All orders all sold to internalizers (and disclosed as such)

>outing to exchanges with smaller spreads, more liquidity

Nbbo rules, orders are sold to internalizers not routed to market so you're getting a better execution compared to the DISPLAYED liquidity which is all that matters. Interacting with non-displayed liquidity isn't a feature of retail brokerages. You'll need to go with a DMA provider for that (and pay for the execution)

>Aren't HFTs incentivised to execute as low as possible while still remaining in the NBBO?

HFTs are incentivized to get the most order flow, they do this by providing the best price improvement to the broker. Better the price improvement, the larger % of volume they receive from said broker. Every two weeks, brokers compare PFOF providers PI data to determine who gets what % of order flow.",[],0
978,gzf3tq2,2021-05-25,t1_gzerw1t,algotrading,"The cost function can be very tricky to design. You cannot simply use maximizing networth as a cost function because it might not learn anything most of the time or it will consider hodl as most optimal strategy and would not be optimal.

Also, an inherent problem with RL is, it works optimally on known cases ie the data pattern or trend it has seen in the past. Which generally due to stochasticity wouldn't  be as optimal.

Another reason is the issue of the changin environment and action space choices.

Generally in RL the environment is stable meaning and the action choices has the same outcomes in almost all cases. In case of stock market when the agent moves to a new state the environment changes drastically, say if the stock is at all time high or has a very steep rise it wouldn't have optimal strategy then. In short, the movement of the agent would change the environment itself and consequently the rules of the environment. Also there is no guarantee that the learned strategy is an optimal one as everytime you train the strategy changes slightly and in a stochastic environment it can have a cascading effect.

 These issues might not look too complex at first but these are the problem that is currently preventing RL from industry use.",[],0
