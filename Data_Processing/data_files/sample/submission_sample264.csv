The recent price action failed to attract buyers as the price has decreased by almost 3%, although we were expecting a move to the upside.

Even though it seems like dips are getting bought, the price has managed to breakdown below $4.20, resulting in a new low at $4.04 where it seems like it finally  attracted some decent buying power.

Still the price doesn't show any clear indication of a trend change, just a dip that got bought.

It's important to break above $4.20 to close daily candle in similar fashion as we are used, to make it seem as the dips to $4 area are getting bought on regular.

We think the way how ZKIN will change it's trend will be an oversold bounce, a dip that will lead into a strong buying pressure as before.

On the bright side, it's enough to break above resistance at $4.30, which break of will change the short term downtrend, into an uptrend. 

Current support is located at $4.10 where the support was strongest in this drop and resistance is located at $4.20.

Indicators.

RSI broke the trend of higher lows, broke below 40 which led to the bespoke break to $4.04 per share. As of right now, RSI is above 40 meaning that the bearish momentum isn't anymore and the price shouldn't drop further.

MACD has started a corrective buying wave with buying volume increasing so far.

The overall trend still remains a downtrend.",ni1asq,[],0

That allows them to grow regardless of what is happening in the broader economy

If a company can grow its costs at a slower rate than revenue then its profits will grow at a FASTER than revenue.

 **7/ Low-cost customer acquisition**  

The best marketing is no marketing  Great companies create demand through word of mouth and spend little on sales & marketing 

 **8/ Diversified Revenue**  

Companies that depend on a few customers for most of their revenue are fragile  One customer leaving can ruin the investing thesis  Great businesses serve thousands of customers, not just a few big ones

 **9/ Great Management**  

Management matters  Here is a thread I wrote in what I look for in a great CEO 

 Track Record Of Outperformance  Winners keep on winning  

Ask: 

Has the business outperformed under this CEO?   

Market share growing?  

Revenue increasing?  

New products/services selling? 

 Invest in CEOs with a proven track record of success 

**10/ Reinvestment Opportunities**  

Great businesses can reinvest profits back into themselves at high rates of return for long periods of time  This continuously grows the profit stream, which will eventually lead to share price appreciation

 **11/ Profits** 

 Companies that produce profits have far more control over their destiny than companies that don’t  I want to see that both net income & free cash flow are positive & growing 

 **12/  Optionality**

  Great companies create new revenue opportunities for themselves by launching new products/services that open up new markets 

 Ex:

[$MELI](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MELI&src=cashtag_click) \-> Payments 

[$TSLA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click) \-> Energy Storage 

**13/ Huge Total Addressable Market (TAM)** 

 I want to own companies that have only captured a small fraction of their opportunity  That creates a long runway for continued growth 

**14/  Price Maker**  

Companies that sell commodities have no control over the price of their product  I want to own price makers, not price takers 

**15/ Anti-Fragile Balance Sheet**  

Cash-rich companies get stronger in downturns  Debt-laden companies get weaker in downturns

233,2021-05-21,StockMarket,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 21, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) declining modestly after yesterday’s rally. It’s encouraging to see the market holding on to yesterday’s gains following the volatility experienced in recent weeks. It seems overall market sentiment is improving following a surge in inflationary fears after the release of the April Consumer Price Index. The SPY closed 0.08% down, the QQQ closed 0.56% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.36% up.

Markets have recently been shaken by the prospect that a rise in inflation may prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. However, as has been reiterated in the recap before, there are several reasons why a change in monetary policy seems very unlikely. In the Federal Reserve’s April meeting minutes, “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals”.  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered. The April Job Reports showed only 266,000 jobs added back to the economy, widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March, bolsters that argument.

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also noted “a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.

**Highlights**

* Shares of Nvidia (NVDA), one of the leading semiconductor companies, jumped after the company announced a 4-1 split. This means that after the split goes through, every share of  NVDA will become 4 and the price will adjust accordingly.
* In the midst of surging prices, the housing market has begun showing signs of slowing down. Today, the National Association of Realtors showed that existing home sales fell 2.7% in April compared to the month prior. That is well below the expectation of 1% growth and may be a sign the rise in prices may be slowing in the near-term. However, compared to April 2020, existing home sales are up 33.9%.
* Snap (SNAP) said it will acquire WaveOptics, a British Augmented Reality company, for over $500 million. The company has recently been making a big push into the world of wearable AR technology.
* China's internet watchdog said on Friday that companies including ByteDance, Baidu, and Microsoft (MSFT) improperly collected user data in the country.
* Yesterday, the US Department of Treasury announced it was taking steps to crackdown on digital assets by requiring any transfer worth $10,000 or more to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
* China’s Financial Stability and Development Commission, which is chaired by Vice Premier Liu He, released a statement today saying it is necessary to “crack down on digital asset mining and trading behavior and resolutely prevent the transmission of individual risks to the social field.”

368,2021-05-21,StockMarket,"It is painfully apparent that the bulls are trying to get back into the market. Unfortunately, they weren't successful today, contributing to this highly volatile market. The QQQ gained a distribution day, but the good news is that we look to be in a current stage one sideways trajectory (in the daily time frame).

Market declines are the perfect times to find winners, but intuition is also a part of the game. As the market looks right now, most of the distribution days for both the SPY and QQQ are soon to be insignificant and not counted over next week, so that gives confidence of a soon approaching strong bull comeback. The stock market is also a funny beast and doesn't care what people think it looks like it's doing, so it may also add more distribution days, further plunging us into a downward trajectory.

Long story short, if you are considering jumping in to try to catch the early swing, protect yourself, and a great way to do that is with a stop-loss order.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 24th, 2021.

# **Stocks could be volatile in week ahead amid turbulence from cryptocurrency - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/stocks-could-be-volatile-in-week-ahead-amid-turbulence-from-cryptocurrency.html)**
*****
> The trading pattern of the past two weeks – particularly alongside cryptocurrency’s movements – suggests stocks could continue to be volatile in the week ahead.
*****
> Investors are watching the wild swings in bitcoin and trying to gauge whether technology shares can gain traction after a rally attempt in the past week.
*****
> The Dow and S&P 500 were lower in the past week, but Nasdaq was slightly higher, helped by a positive move in tech, as well as buying in biotech and big cap growth names like FANG members Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix.
*****
> A steep plunge in bitcoin after China announced new regulations soured the mood for risk assets during the past week. The U.S. also called for stricter compliance with the IRS. Further, on Friday, China said it would crack down on bitcoin mining and trading.
*****
> “What’s interesting is the market is being bullied around by where bitcoin goes,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. Bitcoin plunged by as much as 30% on Wednesday, to about $30,000. Though it recovered to above $42,000, it slid again on Friday.
*****
> The cryptocurrency was down about 9% late Friday, hovering around $36,000, according to Coin Metrics.
*****
> “Bitcoin is a poster child for risk appetite,” said Boockvar. “It tells you the stock market is more on uneven ground, if we’re getting dragged along by bitcoin.”
*****
> There is some key data in the week ahead. Consumer confidence, home price data and new home sales are out on Tuesday. Durable goods will be released Thursday, and the consumer sentiment report is issued Friday.
*****
> But the most important data will be the personal income and spending data, which includes the personal consumption expenditure price deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.
*****
> “The key to next week is going to be the inflation numbers. The inflation numbers are now becoming the new payroll numbers in terms of market performance,” said Boockvar. “What will also be interesting is inside the consumer confidence numbers, is where the inflation expectations go.”
*****
> The consumer price index was surprisingly hot when released last week, showing core inflation at a year over year pace of 3% in April. The core PCE price index was up 1.8% year over year in March.
*****
> In the week ahead, earnings season is winding down but there continue to be reports from retailers, like Best Buy, Costco and Nordstrom. NVIDIA and Dell also report.
*****
> # No correction yet
> As the market has chopped around this month, dip buyers have stepped into the declines and snapped up perceived bargains.
*****
> Some strategists do not see a correction just yet, though pullbacks could continue.
*****
> “For me, my framework is we can only get a 10% correction when we have a liquidity set back, when we have a policy tightening,” said Barry Knapp, managing partner of Ironsides Macroeconomics. “In any of the little disturbances, we are getting about a 4% to 6% pullback.
*****
> Knapp said investors are fretting too much about higher interest rates being a problem for technology companies. “You should be in the cyclical parts of tech,” he said. Knapp noted that subsectors like semiconductors and software should do well with the economic reopening and global manufacturing rebound.
*****
> Tech squeaked out a slight gain in the past week, gaining 0.1%, but semiconductors popped nearly 3%. Software was up 0.2%.
*****
> The Nasdaq was 0.3% higher on the week to 13,470, while the Dow was off a half percent at 34,207. The S&P 500 was down 0.4% to 4,155.
*****
> The best performing sector was real estate investment trusts, up 0.9%, followed by health care, up 0.7%. Biotech was higher on the week with the IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF, up 1.1%.
*****
> “It wouldn’t shock me if we went straight back to new highs,” Knapp said. “Part of the reason I thought we would trade in a range, was earnings season was done but net revisions is surging.”
*****
> He said earnings for the S&P 500 are now expected to be up 7% more for the year than when the first quarter reporting season began.
*****
> Knapp expects the Fed may discuss tapering its bond buying at its Jackson Hole meeting in late summer, and that is the likely trigger for a correction. Back to World War II, he said the first correction after a recession was triggered by the Fed normalizing policy.
*****
> “Last cycle, we had eight of those,” he said. “Every attempt they made to normalize policy caused one of these risk off events.”
*****
> Knapp said it’s natural for investors to be focused on the Fed now. “It’s an uncertainty shock,” he said. “It will cause a correction and everyone is focused on it. The Fed has not really changed its policy since the depths of the pandemic.”
*****
> Knapp said Treasury yields have drifted lower during efforts in Washington to reach a bipartisan plan on infrastructure spending. But he expects the market to react differently in the next two weeks, since he expects those efforts will clearly fail and Democrats will focus on a big spending program that will increase the deficit.
*****
> The bitcoin crypto mania was lifted by the idea of big spending from Washington, and the infrastructure spending could be positive. “The thing that was the surprise in 2021 that really drove the mania was the blue wave and then the spending blowout,” he said, noting bitcoin gained on the potential for inflation and big deficit spending.

> # Economic Surprise Index Tips Negative For The First Time In A Year

> While the overall trend of economic data has been for further improvement, things have slowed recently relative to expectations. In the charts below, we show the charts of the Citi Economic Surprise indices for the US, Emerging Markets, the Eurozone, and the entire world. Broadly speaking, positive readings indicate that economic data is coming in better than forecasts while negative readings indicate the opposite. Every region of the globe has pulled back over the past couple of months but for the most part, current readings remain at the high end of their historical ranges. In fact, the indices for Emerging Markets, Eurozone, and the whole globe all sit in the top 3% of all readings in their histories. The one place that is not the case is the US. Since last summer, the surprise index has been trending lower off of record levels, and just yesterday, it hit it tipped negative for the first time since June 2nd of last year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/CESI.png))**

> Lasting 248 trading days, this was the longest streak of consecutive positive readings in the index's history dating back to 2003. The only other streak that lasted nearly as long was a 189 day long one which came to an end in June 2018.

> # Post-Election-Year June: Third Worst S&P 500 Month

> June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

> In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to –1.1% while S&P 500′s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%. NASDAQ lands in the middle, advancing 50% of the time with an average gain of 0.4%

> # May Manufacturing Starting Off Strong

> The first manufacturing data for May came out this morning with the release of the New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Survey. General business conditions remain at historically strong levels although there was some slowing in May as was expected. After hitting the highest level since October 2017 last month, it was expected to fall to 23.9 in May. The index did in fact decline, but only to 24.3. While lower, that is still around some of the strongest levels (excluding last month) in three years as more businesses continue to report improvements in business conditions than weakness.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-1.png))**

> Breadth in this month's report was pretty mixed; namely with regards to current conditions versus expectations. Every index is still showing an expansionary reading with particular strength out of the indices for the present situation. In fact, most of those indices still sit in the top decile of their historical range with a few like those for unfilled orders, delivery times, and prices even at or just off of record highs. But there were a handful that moved lower: delivery times, inventories, and number of employees.

> Regarding expectations, it was much harder to find an increase. Delivery times and technology spending were the only two of these indices to rise month over month. While many indices for expectations still sit at historically strong levels, there are more that are middling within their respective historical ranges. Overall, the report showed that New York area firms have seen a peak in optimism even as they continue to report strong conditions.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-Table.png))**

> Demand certainly appears to be one area without much in the way of weakness. New orders rose 2 points month over month to 28.9. That is the highest level in just over 15 years and the only other readings as high occurred throughout late 2003 to mid-2004. Those orders are making their way out the door at an increased rate too as shipments climbed to 29.7. That index has been making a vertical climb since the winter as it reached its highest level since August 2007.

> Despite this, NY area firms are not fulfilling orders fast enough. Last month saw the Unfilled Orders index rise by one of the largest amounts in a single month on record, and it continued to climb albeit by a much smaller 0.2 points in May. The only month on record with a higher reading in unfilled orders was September 2001. Inventories were one of the few current condition indices to fall in May, although the reading still indicated growth. In other words, those unfilled orders are not necessarily drawing down on inventory levels.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-2.png))**

> Supply chains are one of the main areas that are likely holding things back. Higher readings in the delivery times index mean that businesses are reporting that it takes longer for products to reach their destination. Even after falling 4.5 points in May off of the April record, the current level sits well above the prior record high of 16.2 from March 2018.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-3.png))**

> In addition to taking longer for products to get to where they are going, the price point is on the rise. Both indices for prices paid and received rose to record highs in May. In fact, over the past two months, there has not been a single respondent to have reported a decrease in prices paid. That is the first time that has occurred since February and March 2012.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-4.png))**

> Last week saw a blockbuster job openings report and the Empire Fed survey is showing a similar willingness to take on more workers. The current conditions index for the number of employees continues to show that businesses are on net increasing their workforce, though at a slowed pace from April. Additionally, the index is at a much less elevated part of its range (the 81st percentile) relative to other indices within the report, but the much more elevated reading in expectations (98th percentile) would indicate the businesses would like to take on far more workers. That is, there appears to be a bit of a disconnect between the actual number of new hires and businesses' expectations to take on more workers. Potentially as a result of an inability to hire enough workers, the average workweek has continued to climb. At 18.7, the index is at its highest level in a decade.

Although it has been six months since the record high of 90 without much of a push back up to those record levels, homebuilder sentiment continues to come in well above anything observed prior to the pandemic. Commentary from the NAHB noted that the strong reading on homebuilder confidence is thanks to the low housing inventories, low rates, and strong demand, despite the headwinds of rising costs. While that could have played into the small decline in traffic, future sales did tick higher.

> Whereas the headline number was flat on the month, readings based on each region saw much more variety. By far the largest move was for the Northeast. Since running back up to the record high back in February, homebuilder sentiment in the Northeast has fallen for three straight months and is now at the lowest level since January. The decline in sentiment in the Northeast is relatively recent. Whereas the region tied its record high earlier this year, the other regions all peaked out in the fall. For the Midwest, the declines have kept coming with 3 point declines in each of the past three months alone. The West and South, on the other hand, have found some respite. The South has ticked higher by 2 points in back-to-back months as it reached the highest level since December. Meanwhile, the West was unchanged at 91 in May.

> As for homebuilder stocks, the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) had been trading in overbought territory throughout most of the spring but in the past couple of weeks, it has come back down to Earth. Last Wednesday, ITB successfully tested its 50-DMA with a small bounce at the tail end of the week. So far today, it has turned lower alongside the broader market with a 1.35% decline. While that means Friday's close marks a lower high, for the time being, the uptrend is still intact.

> # Increased Caution Across Sentiment Indicators

> The S&P 500 has been holding up at its 50-DMA in the past week while more speculative areas of the market (i.e. crypto) have experienced wild swings. As a result, sentiment on the part of individual investors has not seen much of a move. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment was little changed this week climbing half of one percentage point to 37%. Although that was not a large move in the past week, sentiment has taken a big hit over the past month having fallen from well above 50%. In spite of that big drop and even though sentiment is around the lowest levels of the past half-year, the current sentiment level is within one percentage point of the historical average. In other words, optimism is low versus recent history but is very much middling from a longer term perspective.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull.png))**

> Meanwhile, bearish sentiment fell 0.7 percentage points to 26.3%. Unlike bullish sentiment, that is a bit lower than the historical average of 30.5%

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bear.png))**

> Those corresponding moves meant the bull-bear spread climbed to 10.7 from 9.5 the prior week. Excluding last week, that is still one of the lowest readings since February.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

> Neutral sentiment has been the star of the show recently. The gain this week was tiny at only 0.2 percentage points, but nonetheless, it marked the fifth consecutive week in which neutral sentiment has risen. At 36.7%, it is now at the highest level since the second week of 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Neutral.png))**

> The Investors Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers took a less optimistic tone this week as bullish sentiment fell 4.1 percentage points to a ten-week low of 54.5%. Bearish sentiment was unchanged at the highest level since the end of March. The survey also questions respondents on whether or not they expect a correction. That reading rose 4.1 percentage points to 28.3% in the biggest one-week uptick since the last week of April when it rose 4.7 percentage points. That leaves the reading at the highest level since the week of March 10th. Before that, you would need to go back to September 23rd to find as high of a reading.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-II-Correction.png))**

> Another sentiment reading that has taken an even more dramatically negative tone lately has been the National Association of Active Investment Managers Exposure Index. This index measures how exposed to equities managers are where readings of 200 would mean they are leveraged long, 100 would be fully invested long, 0 would be neutral, -100 is fully short, and -200 is leveraged short. This week saw the index fall another 2.65 points after a massive 40-point decline last week. That is the lowest level since last March and April of last year. Altogether, while sentiment still favors bulls, there has been a more cautious tone that has been reflected in managers reducing exposure to equities.

703,2021-05-22,StockMarket,"Saw the news about Bill Gate's portfolio the other day and it felt really strange that I was hearing the name of every single company on his portfolio for the first time.

Most of his picks have had massive 1-y% gains and they're not even tech. For example, here are the top three and their respective 1-year change:

* AutoNation (**AN**). 184.2%
* Deere (**DE**). 180.3%
* Waste Management (**WM**). 43.0% 

Question is, are these picks a long-term buy? Is it worth getting into any of them at the moment?

705,2021-05-22,StockMarket,"I'm looking for the best QQQ  UK equivalent to add to my portfolio any idea? 

Now for a rant 

I added r / bogleheads not so long ago and like any guyI didn't read the the rules and regulations who does that sort of s***

 I have a wife & 3 kids,   my day just like the next guy on r / stocks is filled up doing ( what we consider worthwhile s***  

Yesterday I'm  busy surfing the web looking into stocks and fire strategies while reading the odd Reddit posts.

this guy says I'm looking into the jack bogle 3 stock portfolio and is it ok to hold a small amount of a clean energy etf,   so I replied   ""go for it why not start a position at the right price and hold long""  

 next thing a mod is on me about rules something I don't like to have pushed down my throat by a f******  moderator when the is enough ruels in the real world out side things like fb,  instergram reddit,   who some of these moderators think they are i just don't know  they have to be the bullied kids from school that are way to stupid to get in  the police force or the prison service so at 45 years old still living in there Mum's spare bedroom thinking there some sort of f****** professor who knows everything about investing and decides to become a moderator I can only guess.

I bet the pricks got a face only a mother could love

Anyway he ends with him thretinging to ban me over a etf post on bogleheads that is not a bogle pick 

So I sent him a post reply saying

"" I was replying to the op not you if you if you don't like what you read just move on from the Post onto the next post lol ""

He banned  me directly from ballyboughal heads

I also got banned from another Reddit group for saying  f*** you you w***** after a guy told me to fcuk my mother 

Don't get me wrong  I'm not that bothered about any of it as I live a dream life already i am fire at 37 in Madagascar and I'm happy with my investments

But it dose piss me of when people give me crap or try and turn your post comment against you with a comment as simple as "" looks like this guy walked into the wrong salon lads""   or  go completely against you strategy trying to dreamsnatcher from you

This  wind me when I say something and someone  say I'm  completely wrong so i spend  15-minutes justifying why I'm right to then only to check their profile and find out they've got post karma of 12  the last post they wrote started with "" I'm New Here how do I invest in stocks ""   and you go even further into the post history and see the follow  R/ to get a girlfriend and   R / my first wank that wind me up to take 10 or 15-minutes of my time for nothing.


 Is it just me  who is pissed of about not being able to recommend a certain stock or fund or strategy without being kicked off or having your post deleted because you accidentally put something you're not allowed to in ?",ninrob,[],0
728,2021-05-22,StockMarket,"Hey all! I'm new to investing (< 1 year), and because of this, i have opened a few accounts with different companies. I was wondering if there was an application that would allow me to view all of my holdings.   
Really I'm just looking for the basic charts and graphs of the market, and the ability to Type in how much I paid for a stock and when I bought it and have the program use the info to show me what I have.   


Example: On account number 1. I bought stock ABC at 1.00 a share and I bought 100 shares.

on account 2. I bought stock CDE at 2.00 a share and bought 50 shares.   


 I essentially want a program that will let me add this to a master list. and then simply read the stock market and adjust accoringly

886,2021-05-22,StockMarket,"Hello!

So I'm currently trying to get into the stock and commodities market, but am having troubles, because all the platforms that I see available in Europe don't seem very good to me.

Let's take eToro for example. Yes, they offer commission free trades. But they cover that with wider spreads. Also, the minimum I need to deposit there is 200$, which in my country is more than half of a minimum wage. I like being able to invest smaller amounts whenever I want and the minimum for stocks is 50$ and for commodities 1000$ (what the actual f*ck). Another concern is the overnight fees of owning commodities. How could I come out profitable if I hold, for example, gold, for several years, if they take out a percentage of it every day?

I'm focusing on eToro, but a lot of those issues exist also on the other platforms available in Europe, that's why I'm kinda stuck.

The only platform I actually like is Revolut. I can invest as little as 1€ and there's no overnight fees. And it's all combined in an already created bank account with them. Sadly, I've read so many horror stories of people getting their accounts frozen and deactivated for no reason, that I'm scared to use them for anything at this point.

So what would you recommend for someone in Europe who's trying to invest, but can't really afford to invest bigger amounts at once?

What's a decent, safe platform that won't eat away my profits through fees?",nis0rs,[],0
