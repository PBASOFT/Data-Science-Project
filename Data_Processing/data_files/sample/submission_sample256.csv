11,2021-05-22,StockMarket,"Ally Financial (ALLY) has recently gained some popularity over the past few years. They have 2 main streams of revenue, personal banking and auto financing. 

I'm personally drawn to this stock because of the personal banking. I bank with Ally and I really like it so far. Great saving rates, no fees, super user friendly app, great customer service, etc. What's interesting is they don't have physical locations. At first I was concerned about this, but, I haven't ran into issues. 

To my knowledge the personal banking is relative new and growing. Recently they have entered into the investing world as well. I'm sure this will increase their onboarding. 

They seem to have a good culture, the valuation is attractive considering the smaller size and growth, and they offer a dividend. Overall I like the company. 

I think this could be a big win in a few years if they keep onboarding users. Ally is a ""cool new bank"" that is attractive to the younger generation. I understand doubling the user base will not happen over night but I can see consistent growth.

To get an idea of their size relative to other big banks, I'll list a few market caps of well known banks and Ally's below:

ALLY: 20B

WFC: 190B

BAC: 363B

C: 160B

JPM: 492B

Questions that I have:

The savings rates for Ally are higher than many other banks, how do they accomplish that? Lower margins?

Can they actually compete against the ""big banks""?

Do they operate differently? If so, how?

What are the main risk for this company?

Any other info would be greatly appreciated!",nito33,[],1

While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals® (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

· IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration – Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) – Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) – Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it. 

The chicken shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:    [Chlorinated chicken explained: why do the Americans treat their poultry with chlorine? | Analysis & Features | The Grocer](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/food-safety/chlorinated-chicken-explained-why-do-the-americans-treat-their-poultry-with-chlorine/555618.article) – The US Poultry Industry chlorinates chicken as a part of the disinfection process. 

This dependency on chlor alkali to fight COVID isn’t just happening in America. Below are links to numerous countries around the globe using chlorine and chlorine based products heavily to fight COVID.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

181,2021-05-23,StockMarket," Hi all,

I’m hoping for some advice. I’m a 26-year-old (M) from the US – single/no kids.

I  recently had a small manic episode where I bought over 3 Ethereum for  around $4k each as well as 0.1 BTC for $5,557. After seeing the crypto  prices drop quite a bit, I decided to try to get my average cost per ETH  down by buying another 1.5 ETH for $2500 (average cost per ETH is now  around $3500), with the hopes of it briefly rebounding so I could sell  and breakeven - but now it is dipping more.

I  attached a picture of a few charts that I made. Currently, I have  around $106k cash (sitting in 2 checking accounts) and \~$40.5k in a  traditional 401k retirement account. On top of that, my crypto holdings  are currently valued around $14,000 (from an initial investment of  $21k).

In terms of financial goals  – I would like to buy a home or townhouse sometime in the next 12-15  months. I make around $130k/year and have virtually no expenses – I live  at home with my parents- rent free and I own a 3-year-old car and my  motorcycle outright. I have managed to pay my student loans off  entirely. My monthly expenses for car & motorcycle insurance, food,  cell phone, and gym membership total around $550 per month. With all  this in mind… I live in one of the top five most expensive  cost-of-living states and will be a buying as a single-income/single  occupant homeowner. I also don’t own any furniture or any appliances, so  I will have to purchase everything when I do finally get my own place.

I  guess I really have no idea what I’m doing with cash and investments.  Selling now and losing $7k would really stink. I know I can “realize” my  losses and write them off my tax liability, but knowing that I lost  $4500 would be rough to swallow, but holding and losing $21k would be  worse.

I really like what ETH is  doing with sharding and proof-of-stake to reduce energy consumption. I  think it has some kind of future, even recent news coming from foreign  countries, but I don’t want this to interfere with my future home buying  and comfort.

I’m really lost here.

tl;dr:

I’m  not naïve – I know there are winners and losers in every market, but  how does one know when to just cut their losses and sell?  Is this just a  relatively inexpensive lessen in speculative investing that I should  just take on the chin?

Apparently a post here has to have a certain character count. Crossposting isn’t allowed and I can’t even seem to be able to share a screenshot of the previous post. So the above is a link to the original post stuck up on an obscure subreddit because they were the only place I could find where I was able to actually post it.

The rest of this post is just basically me typing additional characters so that I will be able to post here.

I know that this isn’t technically a high effort post. But I’m somewhat proud of the fact that I called it when I did. Despite the fact that hordes of people tried to convince me otherwise.

The reason I came up with the prediction was just from overlapping that famous hype/mania graph overtop of Bitcoin and realizing that they lined up almost perfectly. So perfectly that I initially thought it was comical. However now it isn’t really so funny. The only reason that I was looking into crypto was because I was planning to buy some Bitcoin. I saw it was levelling off and I decided that it wasn’t an optimum time to buy. Especially with the recent media hype.

But then I looked at that chart and every single step listed in the chart Bitcoin had gone through.

Takeoff, first sell off, bear trap, media attention, enthusiasm, greed, delusion, the nee paradigm was obvious from the adds I kept getting trying to sell me crypto wallets, we were just hitting the denial phase.

Since then we have hit the bull trap and the return to normal. 

The only things left are fear, capitulation and despair. We are currently in the capitulation phase I think.

So I am not going to be buying Bitcoin until we return to the mean which just by eyeballing the chart looks like it’s sitting around $15,000.",nix87a,[],1
311,2021-05-23,StockMarket," Money is power. People with power want to be where the money is. Cryptocurrencies spread the power horizontally instead of vertically like the current system. “Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned about potential risks cryptocurrencies pose to the financial system”- I don’t think anyone besides the super-rich and the people at the top of financial institutions think the current financial system is working. Unless you are one of these people, which is like 0.000001%, you should be on the side of cryptocurrency. I know that change is scary and a change that is as big as the opportunity cryptocurrency is offering to the human race is uncertain but this could be the biggest advance in the history of technology that gives power to the masses of not just one country but the entire world. These huge governments (China, United States, Russia) that are currently trying to scare people with news of regulations and crackdowns on cryptocurrency are not doing this for the good of people, they are doing this because they know, like we know, that cryptocurrency is the biggest threat to their power and money than anything ever before. The whole blockchain movement is so young and is growing faster than ever, the more people learn about it and get involved is beneficial to everyone. I truly see this technology changing the world for the better (in a way the internet did) and the people who have the most money and the true power in this world do not want this.

like bro I'm fucking NEW. first off I never asked about crypto and second off shut up. we all know about crypto. we know. we get it. but here's the thing. telling new investors to ""just buy bitcoin it's the future!11!11"" is how you make people lose money. 

hopping on trends and putting your money on a literal fad/trend like bitcoin (I feel like the hype is more emotional than logical), is literally just the most ignorant thing ever. on top of that crypto goes 24/7 and is super volatile. meaning you could buy ethereum, see a +.05% profit, and go to bed. you wake up and since you're new and don't even know stop losses exist, you wake up and see that it dropped significantly in such a short amount of time. 

as a new investor you're more likely to panic sell here. on top of that, if you try to HODL thinking it'll go up, if you put money in something like a fad/trend because ""bro it's the future!!1!11"" and people dip out the trend, it only goes more and more down. 

telling new people to invest in such a highly volatile and scary thing, especially when stuff like doge which felt like a fad in the first place, is beyond aggravating.

1. Don’t panic sell- just because a stock has a bad day don’t panic sell and lose your money. If you truly believe in your stock, it will go back up.
2. Starting out invest in ETF’s- this is probably the thing I wish I could’ve been told. ETF’s are like and mutual fund but you can buy it anytime during the day. They r a safe way to consistently make money. They won’t lose you money(if you pick a good one) in the long run. 
3. Don’t buy a stock because someone said to- I have fallen victim to “hype” stocks that I think will be the next GME, but ultimately fall 50%. I’m down about 20% in my portfolio because I bought into stocks that are sketchy.
4. Stay away from options- some new investors may not know what it is and it should stay that way. It is the equivalent of gambling. 
5.crypto- crypto is very volatile and u could lose your whole investment in a day. I wouldn’t say you shouldn’t invest in crypto, but be smart. Also don’t buy DOGE it’s literally a meme.
6. Don’t invest money that your aren’t prepared to lose- the stock market is unpredictable sometimes. A new pandemic could occur or a world war could breakout or another Great Depression could happen.

Tellurian quoted the tweet stating “[TellurianLNG ready to support this cooperation 🇺🇸 + 🇰🇷with #USLNG from Driftwood $TELL #LNG](https://twitter.com/TellurianLNG/status/1396127896939515906?s=20)”.

This tweet may be a tease but we all know what they’re trying to tell us.[ South Korea was the top destination for US LNG exports in September 2020!](https://twitter.com/lngglobal/status/1328389385872498689?s=20)

What is Tellurian?

Tellurian was founded in 2016 by two industry icons, Charif Souki and Martin Houston. Charif set in motion the first liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from the United States Lower 48 and founded Cheniere Energy. Martin originated the concept of LNG destination flexibility, ensuring that LNG became a commodity.

Tellurian is currently a debt-free company!

What is LNG?

[Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been cooled down to liquid form for ease and safety of non-pressurized storage or transport. It takes up about 1/600th of the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state. LNG is odorless, colorless, non-toxic, and non-corrosive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_natural_gas).

When LNG is returned to its gaseous state, it is used across the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors for purposes as diverse as heating, cooking, generating electricity, and manufacturing a wide variety of products. LNG is also used as a fuel for heavy-duty and other vehicles.

Who is Charif Souki?

To put it in simple terms…Charif Souki is the Elon Musk of LNG.

Charif co-founded Tellurian and serves as Executive Chairman of the Board. He also founded Cheniere Energy, Inc. in 1996 and served as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President until December 2015. Prior to Cheniere, Charif was an investment banker. He serves on the board of trustees of the American University of Beirut and as a member of the Advisory Board of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Charif received a B.A. from Colgate University and an MBA from Columbia University.

[Charif Souki was the highest-paid CEO in 2013](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2014/04/29/does-cheniere-energys-ceo-really-deserve-142-million-annual-pay/?sh=40567db29c59); this proves that he’s the real deal. Charif Souki was voted out of his position at Cheniere by [Carl Icahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Icahn). Charif Souki was fired because he wanted to expand Cheniere with projects such as Driftwood whereas Carl wanted to spend their cash flows on dividends. Carl Icahn to date has never met Charif Souki in person.

Charif Souki resurrected his Driftwood plans by co-founding Tellurian.

What is Driftwood?

[Driftwood LNG LLC](http://driftwoodlng.com/), owned by Tellurian Inc., is developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production and export terminal on the west bank of the Calcasieu River, south of Lake Charles, Louisiana. Once complete, the terminal will be able to export up to twenty-seven million, six hundred thousand tonnes of LNG per year to customers worldwide.

Tellurian’s Team

The team at Tellurian together accounts for 75% of the LNG export from the USA today. In 2020; 5281 BCF of Natural Gas was exported from the USA. At current JKM (Asian Market) prices for June 2021, that is equivalent to around $37,508,302,500. At current TTF prices (European Market) prices for June 2021, that is equivalent to around $32,161,290,000. These numbers tell you that the team at Tellurian is no joke and should not be taken lightly.

The President & CEO of Tellurian, Octávio Simões brings 38 years of impressive energy industry experience to Tellurian’s remarkable infrastructure team. Previously, he was President and CEO of Sempra LNG & Midstream where he was responsible for all LNG and natural gas midstream activities in Sempra’s efforts to develop, build and operate liquefied natural gas (LNG) receipt terminals, liquefaction facilities, natural gas pipelines, and storage facilities. He led the company’s efforts at Cameron LNG, Energia Costa Azul LNG and Port Arthur LNG, where he focused on reliability of deliveries to customers, safety and gas sourcing strategies that assure reliable production of LNG. Octávio has deep relationships in the LNG market and an unmatched tenacity for developing new projects.

Martin Houston the Vice Chairman and Co-founder is also an LNG veteran with nearly 40 years of experience. He’s managed all forms of enterprise in the energy industry, has established a strong external reputation in the international gas business, and is largely credited with being the key architect of BG Group’s world-class LNG business. In recognition of this, in 2011 he was the first recipient of the CWC LNG Executive of the Year award.

Why hasn’t Driftwood started construction yet?

The Driftwood project will cost $27.5 Billion including pipelines. Driftwood will produce 27.6 MTPA of LNG. Tellurian has been looking for Equity partners to help with the funding of Driftwood. Tellurian currently has one equity partner which is TOTAL SE. If FID for Driftwood isn’t reached by June 2021 then TOTAL can choose to back out of their position. If they choose to exit, it won’t be an issue for the company as Charif Souki[ “said building the terminal is no longer dependent on the Total agreement.”](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/051221-tellurian-to-finish-commercialization-of-driftwood-lng-first-phase-in-few-weeks-souki) Tellurian currently has all permits required for Driftwood and Charif Souki confirmed that they are intending on starting basic construction this summer and planning on giving [Bechtel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechtel) the green light to begin full construction early next year.

What’s going on with commercial agreements?

In a [recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhmSef_1eUM) with [Citi Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup), Charif Souki stated that ""We want to finish our commercial agreements, which will happen in the next few weeks,” Souki said the offering has been very popular and, if Tellurian hits its target in the next few weeks, would be oversubscribed.

A [recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbQuICpNTYU) targeting Short Sellers was posted by Tellurian. Charif Souki asked the shorts “What do you think is going to happen when we start announcing some of these long-term commercial agreements that we’ve been working on for so long? This will be an interesting question and we will see how the market reacts when this happens.” - We are the market and it’s our time to react.

Our Friends over at Citadel decided to buy [Puts](https://imgur.com/a/EWrhH4T) for TELL 🤦‍♂️ - How many times do we have to tell them not to mess with us 😤

Is TELL a quick trade or a long-term hold?

Charif Souki has made it [clear](https://youtu.be/kQn-eMCbjaM?t=727) that he is building a business and that TELL is not a trade. If you just want quick profits then this stock is NOT for you!

Tellurian’s Competition:

Although no one in the US will be able to come up with a business model more profitable than Tellurian’s Driftwood. Qatar in many people’s eyes is seen as a big competitor and one that will destroy all US LNG exports but this is simply just not the case. Countries that import LNG diversify their “LNG portfolio” and will buy from a variety of countries and not just anyone in particular. No matter how profitable Qatar’s LNG plan is; Success is almost inevitable for TELL. Charif Souki personally talked about this and with utmost respect reassures us that Qatar is not a competitor.

Stock Price📈:

Tellurian themselves have implied that the TELL stock will have a value of $12-$17 at FID! TELL is currently trading for $2.62! In the Citi Interview, Charif Souki said that the stock will have $7 FCF in a couple of years! The multiple for the FCF is decided by the market… but is usually around 10x+!🚀🚀🚀

Institutional Owners: - [https://imgur.com/a/ssYRYfP](https://imgur.com/a/ssYRYfP)

Why am I invested in Tellurian🦍🦍🚀🚀?

I am invested in Tellurian because I believe in the business model and also believe in the team. Charif Souki is a very intelligent man and Tellurian’s weekly “2 minutes with Charif” videos keep investors up to date about what is going on with LNG throughout the world along with the occasional updates about Driftwood. $TELL has been through a lot these past few months but we have been setting high lows and higher highs last week which makes it appear as so we are in the “c” or correction wave according to the [Eliott Wave Theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/elliottwavetheory.asp). The fundamentals of this company haven’t changed and things are only getting better.

TELL Positions- [https://imgur.com/a/SpY4hAC](https://imgur.com/a/SpY4hAC)

I am long TELL.

**TL;DR -** Tellurian teased their agreement with South Korea earlier today and TELL is basically in a correction. The announcements of commercial agreements will help the stock reach a fair value. This is not your regular start-up company as the team has a shit ton of experience. With a highly profitable business model along with big connections in the business; Tellurian is lined up for success and is just waiting for the perfect time. Carl Icahn a short seller caused the highly respected Charif Souki to be fired from his own company and shorts are betting against his new company. It’s time to crumble the shorts. It’s time for the bulls to takeover!

**TL;DR of TL;DR -** Tellurian is a steal at the current price and you should buy as many shares as you can! The tutes are loading up so why aren’t you? It’s time Bulls! It’s time to crumble the shorts!

932,2021-05-23,StockMarket,"SPACs might be dead (sorry Chamath), but this one merger has a cult-like following as the buzz around the name continues to grow. This SPAC is IPOE and the merger is with FinTech company SoFi. Brick and mortar banks and queuing in line for services is so 2019, in 2021 this process has become *digitized* and the goal is to have a bank in your *pocket*.

**Banks vs FinTech**

The expansion of financial services and cross-selling of them to existing customers has been a common strategy for traditional banks and finch companies alike. Traditional banks have a massive, already established customer base that they can easily cross sell other financial services to. In fact, the top 15 banks in the world control over 50% of all US bank accounts.

*Processing img rc5j1vtx9w071...*

&#x200B;

SoFi’s moat surrounds 3 different segments:

1. Lending: Personal/student loans and refinancing
2. Tech Platform: Galileo acquisition and payments infrastructure
3. Financial Services: Investing, credit cards, money transfers, etc

**Galileo**

I want to touch up on Galileo because SoFi’s acquisition of the company was highly strategic and has enabled them to integrate at a larger scale. Galileo is a B2B purchasing/payment platform that works with FinTech entities such as Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, and Revolut. With the Galileo platform, these companies can create complex financial payment processes and enable digital banking solutions. Think of Galileo as the infrastructure behind it all and they are growing by over 100% YoY.

**Trends & Growth**

So why don’t the banks just use their existing customer base to expand into the FinTech industry? Short answer: Because they are BOOMERS. The truth is their legacy infrastructure and IT costs do not help when transitioning into the FinTech space. As per Morgan Stanley, most FinTech startups can actually offer these services at nearly 50% cheaper than the traditional banks.

There are some tailwinds the industry is riding that ranges from more and more customers accessing banking services digitally (this number is even higher among millennials), rise in digital payments by over 20% from 2019 into 2020, and FinTech becoming increasingly popular among personal loans.

SoFi’s customer base has been growing at an average of 66% YoY with their last two quarters hitting 75% growth each. It is no doubt that the platform, the industry, and everything about the business is becoming increasingly popular. Management has noted by year-end 2021 they are expecting to hit over 3 million members (currently at 1.7 million).

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

What was mentioned above paints a picture that FinTech is disrupting traditional firms across all avenues of financial services (loans, investments, and banking). Traditional banks are failing to keep ahold of the new generation of customers coming into the market. SoFi is able to circumvent the inefficiencies in our current financial systems and provide unparalleled customer service for all their services.",njbfzs,[],0
