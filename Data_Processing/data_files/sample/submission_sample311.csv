I mean I don’t understand how trading in silver works at any macroeconomic level or within the precious metal industry for commercial and industrial use, But I see that Silver Bullion is also available to retail investors but I literally just cannot understand why any small personal investor would want to buy silver bullion when gram for gram there is the far more efficient option of gold?",nh2dd4,[],0
49,2021-05-20,investing,"We'd start with 2 funds, at $3K each (doing a big home upgrade at the moment so being conservative until we've saved more). 

We'd start with a FSKAX fund which is Fidelity's total market fund. But because we're leery of inflation, we'd open a second fund with FSPHX, a Fidelity health care portfolio. 

Our assumption being that while Alphabet, Tesla and Apple in the FSKAX fund may take a hit for a year of inflation, health care will not. Even if it yields less.

Then our plan is to invest our dividends back into the funds and invest more savings into both once we've recouped what we're spending on our home renovation. We save about $3K a month so we'll roughly be back to a six figure savings account by December.

Appreciate any input.",nh2hm3,"['AAPL', 'TSLA']",0
59,2021-05-20,investing,"Over the past few days i've seen multiple posts from people like 'how do I speed up getting wealthy' and similar titles. Every time I tried giving the same advice but by the time I was done posting the comment the posts would be deleted. Decided to try it this way in an attempt to reach some of the new members on this sub. I'm sorry if this comes off annoying, to the more advanced investors on this sub this will seem really, really basic. I just hope some people find this helpful. 

Trying to speed up the process of building wealth is generally the wrong way to go. One big loss can wipe out YEARS of gains. Some interesting books on this topic are:  


1. **'The Psychology of Money: Timeless Lessons on Wealth, Greed, and Happiness' by Morgan House**
2. **'The Intelligent Investor' by Benjamin Graham**
3. **'Black Swan' by Nicholas Taleb**

Slow compounding interest is what makes people rich. Not super risky investments (even though there can be a place for those in your portfolio, I certainly have a few in mine). 

Investing in the S&P 500 I believe gives you an average return of 6% a year. If you start at age 24 and you have an initial 150,000$ invested into the S&P, with an extra $1000 investment at the end of each month, and you repeat this process until you're 65, you'll have **$3,871,649** invested, from which only **$150,000** is initial cost, and only **$492,000** are monthly deposits. That's quite the retirement. If you factor in a 3% inflation rate and rise in monthly deposits every year, it'll be **$4,966,725.** If you do it until you're 75 instead of 65, it'll be **$9,658,551**. Patience and compound makes you rich.   


You can crunch the numbers yourself depending on your situation:

Even if your income is way less (this previous example was for a guy making 120k$ a year), it can be super effective if you start early and keep compounding throughout your life. Different variables would make it look like this.

Initial deposit: $50,000  
Interest rate: 6%  
Years: 41 (until you're 65?)  
Deposit per month: $500  
Future investment value: **$1,644,922**  
Factoring in 3% annual inflation rate and thus 3% higher deposits every year, it's be 2.1m dollars by the time you can retire.",nh2lpw,[],0

>Core CPI jumped to 3.0 percent year-over-year in April, the fastest pace since 1996. While the base effect from low readings in April 2020 was widely expected by markets, the monthly pace of inflation also rose notably. Core CPI increased 0.92 percent from March to April, the largest monthly gain since 1981.

>The market seems to think this may be the start of an enduring trend of higher inflation, given record fiscal stimulus, ultra-easy Federal Reserve (Fed) accommodation, and ongoing supply bottlenecks. But a closer look at the data suggests that this spike in prices is a one-time adjustment as the economy reopens.

>Spooked bond investors pulled forward Fed rate hike expectations after the CPI release, despite the Fed repeatedly emphasizing that they view this reopening-induced rise in prices as transitory. Investors should believe the Fed when they say they will look through this temporary inflation noise and fade the bond selloff.

>The month-to-month gains in the core CPI were largely driven by a few small categories related to economic reopening and temporary pandemic-induced shortages. 54 of the 92 basis point increase came from used cars, rental cars, airfares, and hotels, despite these categories having a weight of just 5 percent in the core CPI basket. The contribution was so large because the monthly price increases were so huge (e.g. 10 percent gain in used car prices). These increases are unlikely to be sustained beyond the next few months, especially once prices in depressed categories recover back to the pre-COVID trend.

>To the Fed, what matters is the trend in the larger, more durable inflation categories that influence the longer-term inflation outlook. In those categories, sequential inflation was much more muted: rents (including owners’ equivalent rent) and healthcare services contributed just 8 basis points to the monthly gain, despite making up 49 percent of the core CPI index. The Fed is more focused on the chart below than the chart above—and the bond market should be too.

“Good Management”

Without much experience in the corporate business world, I find it challenging to determine how good or bad management might be. Are you looking at past business experience? University education? Revenue? Growth?

566,2021-05-20,investing,"So my parents passed away when I was very young, and as a result a trust account was set up in my name for a portion of the social security money received monthly. They passed when I was 2/3, so it was quite a bit by the time I reached 18. Coupled with my great-grandparents (who were absolutely gems and raised me until 10/11) adding a bit from their estate, upon dispersement, there was a pretty penny.

I’ve long been interested in investing, but I’m 24 and I haven’t had any real extra money since living on my own at 18. After this though, I’d like to put at least $1,000 into some kind of investment; after reading about the absolute SHITE that is interest on savings accounts—and I don’t want to blow all of it because I have little restraint/budgeting knowledge—I thought I could take a portion and try to make some actual money with it. I’m willing to put at most $5k…because if I lose that, it would SUCK but I would be okay.

If you guys have any insight/tips, advice or….any guidance at all, I would greatly appreciate it. I have…very little knowledge about the intricacies of trading and really just have had an impulse to invest a few times….which if I HAD done, with the money I didn’t have to lose at the time, would have made bank… like I could have bought Tesla when they first went public, but thought just because I like the company doesn’t mean anything and it was too confusing to try to learn.

723,2021-05-20,investing,"Oatly Group AB, the vegan food and drink maker, jumped in its debut after pricing its initial public offering at the top of a marketed range.

Shares opened Thursday at $22.12 in New York, a 30% jump from their $17 IPO price. The company and its investors sold more than 84 million American depositary shares on Wednesday, raising more than $1.4 billion. The Swedish company had offered the shares for $15 to $17 each.

Oatly’s shares, which rose as much as 34%, were up 29% to $21.95 at 1:39 p.m., giving the company a market value of about $13 billion, based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

In July, it secured $200 million in new capital from investors led by Blackstone Group Inc. The group also included celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z, as well as Starbucks Corp. founder Howard Schultz. The company was valued at about $2 billion in that round.


Both Jay-Z, through his company Roc Nation, and Schultz also participated in the IPO, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. A representative for Oatly declined to comment. Roc Nation and Schultz didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The IPO underscores plant-based products’ jump into the mainstream, as environmental and health concerns spur consumers to seek alternatives to traditional meat and dairy products. Investors have been looking for ways to replicate the public-market success of Beyond Meat Inc., whose shares have surged more than 300% since it went public in May 2019.

Oatly’s biggest obstacle might be its own popularity. Since its entrance into the U.S. market in 2017, finding Oatly in coffee shops and supermarkets has become something of a treasure hunt for shoppers.

The company opened a $15 million Millville, New Jersey, plant in 2019 to help meet the growing demand, but even now, shortages are frequent, as Covid-related delays have kept a planned second U.S. production from coming online.

In March, supermarkets across the U.S. -- and even its big new customer Starbucks -- reported trouble procuring orders.

While the current shortage won’t end overnight, Chief Executive Officer Toni Petersson sounded an optimistic note.

Fulfilling Orders
“This year, we will bring on board new capacity every single quarter,” he said in an interview ahead of the first trade. The company is expanding its Netherlands plant, putting out commercial products from its Utah plant, and is doing test runs in Singapore, where the factory will be “up and running” in the second quarter, he said.

For now, Oatly is only filling 70% of orders in its key markets, so it is “not really” taking on new customers, Petersson said, adding that the gap is between supply and orders, not supply and demand. “First we will close the gaps, then expand with new retail partners,” he added.

Oatly was started in 1994 by brothers Rickard and Bjorn Oste. Using technology based on research from Sweden’s Lund University, the company turns fiber-rich oats into liquid food.

Oatly’s offering was led by Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Credit Suisse Group AG. The shares are trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol OTLY.",nhap36,[],1

The US has added 10 Trillion in debt or more since 2008, most of that in the last year. People say inflation won’t happen and maybe they’re right. They do this for a living, btw.

But just say a recession or depression were to happen? No one really knows why it will happen or when, but what can the Fed do after printing 5T in the last year and having interest rates already at zero? Create trillions more on top of negative interest rates? 

The US has one of the top 3 highest household debt to GDP in the entire world. So when this crash happens, is the government going to give us all money to pay our visa bills? On top of unemployment and food stamps and healthcare? So what I’m saying is there would likely be a banking crisis again on top of whatever else might be going on.

What I’m saying is that next time there’s a lot less that they can do than they had the option to do just 13 years ago. Especially after the last year.
