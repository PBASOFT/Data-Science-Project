Two clicks from the home page and I'm on my time sheet for the week, click Actions drop-down menu on the right, Auto-fill from Schedule, check off any days that are holiday or I'm taking PTO, and a few more clicks and my time is in for the week.

Granted some of my employees are required to be more granular to allocate 1hr towards this project, 4hrs towards another project, but I also have salaried employees like myself that just do the 8hrs/day Auto-fill from Schedule option.

So, from my perspective, I'm not sure how the process is any worse than an excel spreadsheet.

If it's a shared spreadsheet, isn't it susceptible to others mistakenly overwriting areas they're not supposed to, or submitting time on someone else's behalf when they think they're on their own line for their submittal?

Retail traders were seen as easy marks by institutions early in the game when it was hard to trade and even harder to unify movement.  Now with how easy it is to trade and even easier to unify movement the retail market can drive the market.  Currently the retail traders are limited to moving a small number of companies, however as the generational capital flows begin to move from the silent and greatest generation to the Gen X and yougner crowds the institutions are going to be bleeding AUM.  This is will threaten the industry, but more importantly will threaten the regulators as they will begin to lose funding as much of it comes from the institutions they regulate.

Essentially, I've lowered my cost basis on the Leaps to $5.00 each.  
Total risk is now $1000. Reward is unlimited. I like Peter Thiel.  
If the stock reaches $100 before the end of the year, I could have a profit of at least $15,000.

Jim Cramer of CNBC Mad Money fame has never been one to shy away from bodacious market calls that appeal to as broad an investing demographic as possible. In his time, he has inspired everyone from Eric Cartman to your granny (probably) to take a flutter on the market.

But, today before US market open, we were struggling to get our heads around this tweet from the dome-headed financial news host.

What on earth is going on here?


One generous interpretation is that Cramer likes fake meat purveyor Beyond Meat’s stock. Why wouldn’t he? After all the $9bn “growth” company grew, err, 11 per cent last quarter making its valuation of 13 times forward revenues seem totally reasonable. Depending on how you spin it, anyway. So perhaps that’s it?


Or perhaps Cramer is not so subtly signalling to the Reddit retail trading army of r/WallStreetBets that the stock is ripe for a short-squeeze. After all, on Monday he did suggest it could be the next meme stock, like dying cinema chain AMC.

To be honest we don’t have a clue.

But if the latter is the case, the tendie-hungry masses seem to have got the message.

In early trading, Beyond Meat’s stock is up nine per cent to $138 on absolutely no news. They did touch $144 earlier.

Cool.

Here’s an idea, though. If we (and yes, that means even FT Alphaville) want to shed the scaly reputation of professional financial journalism perhaps it is better if we don’t go around suggestively egging on the masses into so-called meme securities?

Actually, we’re talking about CNBC here aren’t we? Sorry. Our mistake.",['AMC'],0

I honestly believe that not rebranding BB with a new name is a bad idea. I think when the new CEO comes in next year they'll do it. Chen has had his run ( since 2013 ) but it's time for him to retire ( he's going to be 65 soon ) and they need to find someone young fresh and more energetic to run the company.

Biden is proposing to renew them for 10 years. Sunrun has 15% of float short, so if the clean energy bill proposed by senate passes, or they include the tax credits in the infrastructure bill, get ready for fireworks.

People need to remain advised on the realities at hand, just because the inspection passed for this flight, does not mean the maintenance is now on track for Fall. It was discussed in detail on the earnings call if you skip to 10:00 in. If anything, the past wear could be a sign of accelerated wear which details are being held on, causing the the maintenance schedule to potentially be moved up in between some of these next 3 flights. But oh god, god forbid someone suggests something that would cause the stock to not moon day after day.

5779,gzrq5fb,2021-05-28,t3_nmue5k,wallstreetbets,"Not doing a write-up as a full post, but here's the current gamma structure of AMC as of open this AM. It's probably shifted some as people jet in and out of options. The spike at open probably corresponded to dealer hedging of all of those calls in the 30-35 range that became in or very near the money today.

[https://imgur.com/a/Qw27FB8](https://imgur.com/a/Qw27FB8)

Note that about half of the gamma vaporizes today and with that is a lot of delta evaporating too (about 18% of total delta). And, the dealers at open were holding $3.7B of shares as well according to spot gamma. That value would've climbed up significantly in the open. That means that you may see something more like 25-30% of delta getting dropped from the open to the close, which ends up being more like $1.5B or something.

What does this mean? Well, it means that there will be selling pressure today if this price doesn't break up. There's a gamma ramp down more than up, but more importantly, a lot of calls are expiring OTM today, and as the day goes on, dealers de-hedge. If a gamma ramp happens, it would be hard for the price to go a lot past $40 because the options wear out there. And, there's a big gap between $35 and $40 in terms of dealer support, which we saw in the fizzle this morning. 

It's probably easier to buy this at a low today and hope for next week, than to win today, unless you see a big increase in momentum - the dealer flows will be very significant.",['AMC'],0

A 17c... Is a call for $17.  The $17 is called the ""strike price. The strike price is what he is gambling on.  That is, the closer that it gets to $17, or if it exceeds $17, the value of the call contract increases.

The price doesn't have to go to $17 to make money, but in the best case world, the price would exceed $17.  

A call contract is for a hundred shares.  So a 59 cent $17 call actually cost $59 (59 cents * 100 shares). 

The expiration date, is the point at either the call option is exercised or it expires worthless.  It would expire worthless if the current share price is lower than the strike price.  As an example, it would make no sense to exercise a $17 call if the share price is $15. 

You can exercise a call option at any time, which allows you to purchase the hundred shares at the strike price.  

So if the share price is $33, one contract allows the person that owns it to exercise it and purchase 100 shares at $17 each.  The $59 premium is not the purchase price of the shares, that was the premium to have the right to purchase 100 shares. So exercising the call is still going to cost him $1,700 ($17*100 shares). 

The vast majority of people do not exercise contracts.  They buy the contract, and then sell it after it's value increases. Or they buy a contract, and it expires worthless.

The majority of people let's play with contracts lose money.",[],0

6070,gzrqk7c,2021-05-28,t1_gzrldru,wallstreetbets,"There are others in this comment section that have touched on it, but I’ll give it a go here for kicks.

Calls are basically contracts that allow someone to buy 100 shares of a stock per 1 contract after the stock reaches a strike price.

So if you see 20C, that means it’s a call with a strike price of 20.  If the market value of the stock is over 20 by expiration, you can exercise the contract and buy the 100 shares at the price of 20 apiece.  

However, there’s a premium you’ll have paid for the right to do this; let’s say it’s .59.  That means you pay .59 per share in the contract (so .59*100=59) and that’s your cost to buy the call up front, is 59.  This means the stock value needs to hit 20.59 for you to come out even from exercising the call option.  After that, you would make whatever the price is -20.59= Your total profit.

Puts are the opposite: you buy a contract that allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price. So 17P would be a put that gives you the right to sell a stock for 17 if it happens to go below that price.  Again, it has to go lower than 17-(your premium you paid) for you to make money exercising it.

I’m thinking you can figure out what you’re hoping the stock will do depending on which one you bought (and conversely, which one you sell, if you’re offering the option initially, where you’re the one that’s allowing someone to buy 100 shares at a price or sell their 100 shares to you at a certain price).

TD you’ll probably want to visit the good old Google to see where their options buying and selling are.  Options require a decent amount of investment into learning them and how to buy and sell them, so it seems like it would be doing you a disservice just handing you all the info on how to get that set up so that you end up falling into it without really knowing anything about them.",[],0
