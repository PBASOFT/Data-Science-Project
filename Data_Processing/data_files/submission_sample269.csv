3,2021-05-28,investing,"A vote date of June 10th was set for the SSPK>MAPS merger to bring weedmaps to the NASDAQ.  This is a great way to get cannabis exposure without having to buy OTC.  

In my opinion this has a large growth potential.  The valuation was good.  Forward projections in the investor presentation were very conservative as they did not include new states/countries opening up(NY,etc).  Large market share with a rapidly expanding market. 
A very well put together DD

127,2021-05-28,investing,"Maybe many of you never heard of Pinduoduo because the company main target is in China, not the people outside China. Their app and website don’t even have any language other than Simplified Chinese. However, it is a public company listed in the US stock market. Pinduoduo an e-commerce platform. It offers a suite of product categories just like Amazon and Walmart in the US.

**The Numbers Seem Impossible Yet It is**

**We do believe whatever in the 26 May, 2021 quarterly financial report is definitely real. However, even we do believe it is real, still it raises some concerns to the company.**

***We do assume no one is using Pinduoduo outside China.***

**The User Numbers**

It stated that the average monthly active users in the quarter was 724.6 million. Also, the monthly active users refers to the number of user accounts that visited the Pinduoduo mobile app during a given month, which does not include those that accessed the platform through social networks and access point.

Active buyers on Pinduoduo in the 12-month period ended March was about 824 million. Active buyers refers to the number of user accounts that placed one or more orders, regardless of whether the products and services are actually sold, delivered or returned.

However, let’s compare some well known e-commerce companies in China. Alibaba has 811 million active buyers, and JD has 499 million active buyers. The last two definitely have more people know outside or within China. Even a lesser know Meituan has 510.6 million paying users and you do see their delivery bicycles on every street in China. They are also all having much longer history than Pinduoduo.

What is the concept of 824 million in China alone, let’s quote the Chinese Official data.

Chinese netizens have 898 million in 2020. The internet availability rate was 70.4%. A total of 986 million Chinese used mobile phones to surf the internet, accounting for 99.7 percent of the online population. Around 309 million, or 31.3% of the online population, live in rural areas.

Which means more than 90% people in China who have internet access are using Pinduoduo and made a purchase on the website or the app within this 12 month period. It included part of those those around 300 million people who lived in rural areas and there monthly salary is less than $2000 RMB ($314).

**Underweight**

**We are not by any means questioning the authenticity of the report, we do believe it is real.**

However, there would not be a huge growth rate for Pinduoduo active users. The average revenue per user is just one-fifth of Alibaba’s because Pinduoduo targets the lower end users, and the way they attract users is by giving them a subsidiary (coupons or cash equivalent) to keep their products price lower than other e-commerce platform. That’s just like burning money no matter which way you see it. It can be doing that forever. Because of that, many big brands are hesitant, if not, unwilling to open an official online flagship store in Pinduoduo. Hence, these are the reasons why we believed that Pinduoduo stock price is overpriced by a lot.",nn10j0,[],0

> Some historical perspective is useful. Even during one of the most spectacular “bubbles” in stock market history (the dot.com bubble of the late 1990s, considered damning evidence against EMH), most investors who tried to time the market made egregious mistakes. In 1996, Bob (with John Campbell) presented an excellent paper to the Federal Reserve showing that earnings multiples possessed substantial ability to predict future rates of return. **Since these multiples were then at all-time highs, the work implied a likelihood of low or even negative returns.** This work influenced Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan to make a famous speech questioning whether the stock market was at bubble levels and whether investors were exhibiting “irrational exuberance” in view of the economic outlook. The stock market rallied strongly for four years thereafter, and long-term investors who bought stocks after the speech earned generous rates of return.",nn3ubk,[],1
350,2021-05-28,investing,"I've heard that in selecting a portfolio, it's best to find assets that have (historically) weak/negative price correlation. The problem I've run up against is that, when the market dumps, everything seems to dump together - in other words, assets that didn't seem correlated or were inversely correlated sometimes become strongly correlated when the market is doing poorly, thus sort of defeating some of the protective intent of diversify through non-correlated assets. 

According to your experience, is there any way around this, statistically speaking? Are there different correlation tests that you've found to be more effective for diversification? Is it perhaps best to invest in newer assets in price discovery mode, or to invest broadly by small amounts in any assets that have been least affected by market-wide downturns in the past? Any advice would be appreciated. I'm writing this mostly because of the recent crypto downturn, but I imagine strategies would transfer approximately between crypto and more traditional assets.",nn3xmm,[],0
396,2021-05-28,investing,"Hey guys! I’m almost 25 and have managed to buy a house at 20 while being a single mom, afford braces and other cosmetic surgeries, etc, all while making under 35k year. I’m pretty alright with money, budgeting, and investing in myself long term. 

Since I started being an exotic dancer a year ago, I realized I’m making killer for the time I put in and have gotten serious about saving money. Recently I’ve been wondering if it would be smart to start investing, and I’d like your guys’ input! 

So I ran some numbers real quick on a site and if I start saving 3k a month, dancing until I’m 40, I’ll have $540k without investing. If I invest that much, with est. 7% return, I’ll have almost 1mil! However, will an est. inflation rate of 2.9% my total goes down to ~$611k. 

Right now, I pay taxes on what goes in the bank. Right or wrong, doesn’t matter, that’s not what I’m here for. Anyways, let’s say those taxes go up ~12k/year I’ll have to pay in. That’s $180k in the next 15 years I’m paying in taxes, just for my reported income, not counting taxes on my investments, plus whatever fees it’ll cost me to withdraw my investments, all so I can technically only have ~100k more in investment than I would if I just saved cash. 

So long story short, am I correct in thinking that it’s really just cheaper for me at this point to save in cash than invest? I don’t want to deal with the stress of investing if it won’t pay out much more than not investing.

Any advice or insight?",nn4fk7,[],0
435,2021-05-28,investing,"Disclosure I own shares at $10.50. 

BarkBox is a spac that today approved the merger. The Ticker $stic will be $bark on June 2nd.

Many of these subscription box companies get a bad reputation because there were so many grocery ones that lose billions for years and the pet ones made no money because all they did was get existing products and package them where the margins were horrible. 

Nevertheless, barkbox is different. They own all of the products they put in the box, we call that vertically integrated. Have a retail store and sell the products at target and other online and offline stores. So, given the higher Margins, vertical integration, new revenue channels and fast growth I think the valuation should be more expensive than chewy on a price to sales multiple. Lets not discount that the subscription model will evolve over time churn is around 5% to 6% which is excellent. 

The company actually has a few revenue channels: 

buy subscription (you can customize as well), 

add on products to the box, 

dental (medical and preventative is new and will grow), 

meal plan (sends you monthly box of daily meals; crazy but people/dogs can be picky about food), 

ecommerce/retail where they sell the products on amazon, pet stores etc. this is an interesting business because it is not just ecommerce or subscription because they own a lot of the products they sell as their brand where they have exclusive supplychain and distribution agreements. They also have licensing with plush toys with NBA (example). They realized customers are crazy and treat dogs like people so do stuff accordingly. 

No doubt they will sell clothes, costumers, more medical stuff like fleak tick products to help keep the customes within the ecosystem. 

The ceo is actually new started in september 2020 and has options priced at $16 a share. He came from amazon and ebay and before that consultant at infosys. I think the management hire was an excellent decision as it allows then to scale their ecommerce business and get new customers into the ecosystem via subscriptions or not. I see the subscription revenue as potentially amazon prime stuff where people will just fill it up with what they need and not just junk all the time and people will be happy with that and some add-ons here and there. 

The pet business is a fantastic long-term business as boomers age, etc. strategy for this is to buy now, wait for marketing and pump and sell into the $20 to $30 range. This range of valuation is based in Price to Sales. The bottom I used was 2 times given Its growth rate and almost double the gross margin of chewy and even pet supermarket stores. The guidance for this year has room for upside 

I built a ten year model and see then becoming profitable by 2023, however, all of their cash flow is going into growing the business as I think they can sustain a 30% revenue per year for a few years. I do think there are some potential risks such that the Barkeats business could do poorly if the pricing is not competitive or people change the product mix of the box to less profitable products or cancel all together.

So, just to catch anyone up who is just joining:

Hertz filed for bankruptcy. 

Turns out they were not that bankrupt.

Everybody is getting made whole except for the shareholders.

Shareholders of Class 11 stock that pre-pandemic traded at $20 (now trading $6) are getting bought out.

The payout is in three parts:

1) Cash in the amount of $1.53 per share, plus 

2) Pro Rata shares of (a) 3% of the Reorganized Hertz Parent Common Interests (estimated to be $1 per share), plus

**3) Either:**

**a) 30-year warrants for 18% of the equity in the Reorganized Debtors struck at an equity value of $6.5 billion, or**

**b) rights to participate in a $1.635 billion offering for approximately 35% of Reorganized Hertz Parent Common Interests at a per share price based on a total equity value of approximately $4.7 billion. (Subscription Rights)**

This post is a ""deep dive""/""open discussion"" of the third portion above in bold.

**a) 30-year warrants -** waiting for confirmation. It is believed that these warrants have a strike price of $10. So, an example would be a Warrant is issued with a strike price of $10. New Hertz shares are trading at $15 per share. Warrants can be sold or executed. If sold, warrants typically sell for market price less strike price. So, each warrant would be worth $5. Add to the cash of $1.53 + the equity distribution of $1. Total value $7.53.

**b) Subscription rights -** there are 2 types of subscription rights

**1) Eligible Shareholder** \- accredited investors and institutions. Look it up yourself if you don't know if you are. But basically, you must be a broker, bank or have a net cash worth of $1,000,000.

**2) Ineligible Shareholder** \- everybody else. Probably 99% of the people reading this post.

**What I know about subscription rights:**

Basically, what I learned today is that you can participate in an auction prior to the conclusion of the bankruptcy for share in the new company. 

If you are an Eligible shareholder, you can enter a maximum auction price. If the auction goes above the price you set, then you do not purchase any shares.

If you are an Ineligible shareholder, you can enter a minimum auction price. If the auction does not get to the price you set, you automatically are issued New Warrants in the Hertz.

*Actual language below.*

**Item 9. Election Form for Ineligible Existing Hertz Shareholders** 

The undersigned is an Ineligible Existing Hertz Shareholder and elects to sell its Subscription Rights pursuant to the Shareholder Subscription Rights Auction as follows: 

$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ per Subscription Right (the “Minimum Auction Price”) 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Subscription Rights 

To calculate the maximum number of Subscription Rights that an Ineligible Existing Hertz Shareholder may elect to sell, an Ineligible Existing Hertz Shareholder should multiply the number of Existing Hertz Parent Interests that it holds by 1.0467. 

Note: If you are an Ineligible Existing Hertz Shareholder and do not wish to elect to have your Pro Rata share of the Shareholder Subscription Rights sold pursuant to the Shareholder Subscription Rights Auction described below, **no action is necessary,** and you do not need to return this form. 

**Item 10. Election Form for Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholders** 

The undersigned is an Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholder and elects to purchase Subscription Rights (if any) pursuant to the Shareholder Subscription Rights Auction as follows: 

$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ per Subscription Right (the “Maximum Auction Price”) 

Up to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Subscription Rights

Note: If you are an Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholder and do not wish to elect to purchase Shareholder Subscription Rights that may be sold pursuant to the Shareholder Subscription Rights Auction, **no action is necessary,** and you do not need to return an election.
