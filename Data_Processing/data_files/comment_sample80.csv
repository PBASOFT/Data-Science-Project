And 23.9% of the EV market in Europe 2019-2020, more than just ""viable"". I think the word you're looking for is evidently successful.  


""But saying that they first released BEVs 3-5 decades ago isn’t making the point you think it is. Keep it up tho""  


It's actually making precisely the point I think it is. Tesla *isn't* the first in this market, rather there are a huge range of rivals who realised that the infastructure for EVs didn't exist 2-5 decades ago and instead invested in HEVs and PHEVs which meant that they were still investing in battery technology but combining it with ICE to give it the versatility that was necessary. 

Pretending that legacy companies have been unnecessarily slow or unwilling to to change is fatuous and false. It might apply to some, but it doesn't apply to huge chunks of the industry. As someone who lives in Europe all I've heard about is innovation and invention in the green automobile space for the past two decades.

So instead of being up a ton I made a meager amount compared to what I could have if I wasn’t all in on “the squeeze hasn’t been squoze” bullshit. 

This HODL until it hits the moon is basically the same thing as dogecoin. The hype makes it hit high then it crashes then ya get stuck making thousands less bc “it’s not at its highest yet!!” 

The extra hype from the news cycle makes everyone buy in again. It’s a circle. But this shit isn’t going to hit “the moon” it’s over and gone with, let’s move on to the next hype train so we can all make money again. 

I am not a bot, I am not providing investment advice, I don’t comment/post a ton, and I no nothing about what I’m doing. But this sub has turned from APESTRONGTOGETHER into ape has one fucking banana but wants to buy more banana with his single banana. 

It’s an absolute shitshow and if you honestly believe that GME is going to go to the moon then you’re going to end up losing money. Please. DO YOUR OWN DD AND STOP BUYING INTO THE HYPE.",['GME'],0

You don't need to be a genius to see that TSLA is overvalued as hell. To justify it's current price today (even long after dipping from $900), it would need to sell all the cars sold throughout the world for several years.

Retards will counter this with ""iT's NoT jUsT a CaR cOmPaNy"", but it is. They buy their batteries, they buy their solar panels, they only build the car, and according to the many bad reports, they don't service them well.

I mean another theory could also be that by acquiring xilinx, that growth factor that was built into AMD is gone. xilinx is about half the size of AMD and grows A LOT slower.

And then the benefits of the merger may not be seen as quickly. i.e. you don't just merge and suddenly start spitting out chips designed together. you're looking at probably a 3-5 year horizon before anythiing fruitful comes out of the merger, which is 3-5 years of lower growth of the combined company than what AMD was experiencing. And as with all mergers, the question still remains, will the sum of the parts actually be greater than the parts of the sum. (IOW is 1+1=3?).

1) WSB degenerated to pointlessness? That’s the point. 

2) You misunderstood my comment. Nuance is comparative. I was referring to OP’s use of the word “bet.” Yes, it has to do with date, but the subtle context is more complex as it relates the proximity of psychological and analytical motivation in placing such a bet — which is really actually the only reason anyone cares about this headline (and more importantly, if it is, in fact, actually useful for anyone participating in this discussion today).

3) I think what you’re referring to could be more moderately defined as binary dichotomy, which is also a useful tool, but in situations such as this are imperative to resist, as it would be an oversimplification as pertaining to merely a clarificatory manner.

It’s literally the only path out once you are this deep, even normal 25 years on income based repayments has a tax bomb at the end that will end up with him owing the same or more to the IRS after all that time because the balance has doubled or tripled when you can’t even keep up with interest on IBR and the full remaining amount becomes taxable in a single year when that swollen balance is forgiven.  PSLF forgiveness on the other hand is tax free. 10 years in lower wage job for public service losing 15% off the top is harsh, but it’s not the worst outcome considering the other options from a situation like this one.

They were worth $8 per share before January. You're saying in the past 6ish months their business has become 20x+ more valuable? How? 

IMO the big chance for the squeeze was in January when it went to $350 a share and then brokerages stepped in to fuck retailers. That was wrong, but it happened and I dont think GME will ever go that high again.

Nothing.

They are changing... **nothing**.

Retail is holding some 80-90% of the shares, bullish? WRONG. There's a fundamental reason that institutions aren't *investing*, but short interest has been **increasing**.

The share price is OVER VALUE.

The company BARELY survived the pandemic, almost all of their competitors went bust. How did AMC survive? By being a valuable and irreplaceable service?

Shares in GameStop(GME), which was at the heart of the so-called ""stonks"" retail trading mania earlier this year, have risen by a third in the last one week, while shares in cinema operator AMC are up 39%.  
  
Ortex said short interest in AMC is currently estimated to be 18.3% of freefloat and in GME it is estimated at 21.8% of freefloat.  
  
Yesterday alone, short-sellers lost over $200 million each in both of those stocks, Ortex data shows. GameStop(GME) closed 13% higher at $180.6, the highest level since April 30.

However, that may be due to lack of short volume as the price has went up.

At this post by we can only guess if the price went down because shorts are no longer shorting or that a short exited thier positions (making the short shares available would power the price).

HF's pay attention now and may not want to short in the face of retail hype on the stock.

No one really knows.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Even if the price is say $750 you are obligated to sell at $650 so you would miss on gains. This is an extreme example. My suggestion is wait until Tesla pumps so the IV on the options can build up then sell the calls. I would sell weeklies and far enough out of the money so you don't lose your shares. You can also ""buy to close"" which is just buying your contracts back to close your position and releasing your shares from collateral. This is recommended.

very basic finance accounting & valuation. something like damodaran.

some passive investing like John boggle.

Peter Lynch because very basic, open minded and doing everything. 

some growth investor like Terry smith etc. 

some value investors like Joel greenblat etc.

some cyclical investors.

some longterm thinkers like buffet or munger etc. Philip fisher ! nomad letters ! Thomas William phelps !

pat Dorsey. Michael malboussini! 

outsiders is a good book. I like mc Kinsey valuation as well. 

the most important thing I guess is to gasp the basics of every method, and distil the essentials. at the end of the day it boils down to ROIC, durability of those margins that make the roic, and opportunities to deploy capital at that roic, and the valuation you pay for that roic as an investor.

Example:

Lets say I like AMC.  Today it costs 13.95.  I buy 100 shares of AMC stock from a brokerage.  Cost of 100 shares will be $1,395.

On Fidelity, you can buy the stock and sell a covered call on the stock you just bought in one transaction.

So I buy 100 shares AMC and sell May 21 strike 16 call option for $66 (its listed as .66, but all options contracts are 100 shares so multiple by 100).  You would have gotten more for this, but one day expired already (Monday).  The transaction appears as buy 100 shares AMC and sell 1 options contract (might be referred to as buy/write), but Fidelity has a video on this as does YouTube.  It is a covered call.  You cover the call option with your shares that can be recalled if the strike price of AMC reaches 16 before the end of trading on May 21.  Your shares will automatically be sold, but if this happens, you already gained the $2.05 on each AMC share plus you keep the $66 covered call premium.

Lets look at the put option to hedge against a big loss to the value of the 100 AMC shares. The put for Sep 17 is a good value at strike 12.  It costs 3.38 or $338, but I could go longer term and further out of the money to save initial cost.  I could do I Jan 21 2022 str 10 put for 3.15 or $315.  My opinion is the longer, further out option would be a better value but you risk the stock either going very high to negate the put or the volume dropping enough so your call premiums go down because no one is buying them as much as before.

Total cost for set up...

100 shares AMC $1,395

Jan 21 2022 str 10 put $315

Total $1,710

I then sell $2 out one week covered calls every Monday or Tuesday for roughly $65 to $85",['AMC'],0

So, actually he‘s betting either on (very…?) high inflation, increasing interest rates, default (S&P threatening the US government to take away the AAA bond rating), demand declining. Wtf… easy short. Also he is betting on private prisons (or was betting)… bc higher inflation = more crime… alcohol going up. His bet is against the US economy. 

Ofc you would be fucking afraid to pull off the „big short squeeze“ that wrecks havoc the entire financial/economic system. 

FTDs in May 2020 were 60% when his brokers searched for his shares. 

Rehypothecation was probably maxed out at 140% SI, lmao. Just need the answer: are counterfeit shares without rehypothecation visible to the market as a short position? 

Probably not :p actually I‘ll look for that.

And again: IF HE IS THE REASON TO FUCK THE ENTIRE SYSTEM HE HAS GOT A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM. It was fucking him to convince the GME board/execs to purchase their stock back… that‘s where they were about to get raped. 

People here are underestimating the crisis here… we could see the market crashing 80%… and having a bear market for multiple years lmao. There were far worse times than 2007-2009 and now (economically) 

Equity premium risk & margin debt at astronomical height, retail not willing to sell and still buying the dip (metrics are weird now, lol) 

Don‘t worry about GME… there was by for not enough liquidity for them to cover their position, also just take a look at the borrowing rate while AMC is rising. Lmao, there is no mathematical model for setting up a borrowing rate, the clearing will asses/set up the borrowing rate. Stocks that have an lower SI and higher available float have even a higher borrowing fee. Lmao…

GME is weird, one of its kind. 

Btw: if retail pulls it off and Cohen doesn‘t fuck w/ the legal reported short interest… nothing bad will happen to GameStop after the squeeze. 
So if he squeezes it like Overstock but offers the official short positions to buy themselves back without forcing them to get squeezed (even the legal naked short positions)… nothing bad will happen.","['GME', 'AMC']",0

The last time I checked for AMC, the short interest was around 16% but like I said, there is lots of ways that short interest can be disguised so it may well be much larger.

A short squeeze involves buying into a stock en masse causing its price to rise, and the shorter, who has borrowed the stock with hopes the price would go down has to cover increases in expenses associated with holding the stock, or sell out at a loss. This forces the stock price up further and it becomes a snowball effect.       

My understanding is a gamma squeeze is similar, but it applies to covering options contracts where the holder is expecting the underlying stock to decrease in price.          

In most cases it's an entity that's capable of trading in huge numbers that is shorting, so they will be sticky about simply getting away from the holding because time is usually on their side. If there are equally stubborn buyers of the stock who continue to hold after it's price has increased, the shorter is screwed.",[],1

Historically speaking interest rates have been raised to slow down the economy and hedge against inflation. The problem is we've been printing so much money that devaluation of the dollar is inevitable. Pair that with rising interest rates, you'll have a huge amount of inflation the likes of which we haven't seen in this country in quite some time. But based on what I've seen since January's inauguration, as inflation increases, and rates go up, the job market will get worse unemployment will rise, and what will the whole of the US government do? Print more money. It's a vicious cycle. Most on the sub are probably too young to remember the '80s, but I was born in '78. I remember waiting in lines for gas even in Texas where it was readily available. Not due to a shortage. Just really bad economics.

I agree with the short, I'm sure he's figured out the way to do it right. But if we're reading about it online we're too late to the party. There may still be some money available, but the government can prop itself up for a long time. Plus, I'm sure he figured the filing exposure into his scenario.

Lumber futures have fallen over 25% in the past week. Is this the legendary cyclical demand glut fizzling while the available supply surges? 
Possibly, but not likely. It’s more likely that people aren’t starting new projects and haven n’t been for awhile. In progress projects will pay those high prices because you end up losing money when half built stuff sits. Most summer seasons are bad for building material demand anyway, which is probably only exacerbating the drop.  I’m not bold enough to put a price on where lumber futures will stabilize, but for the sake of my calls I’m going to say. “Soon”. Lumber companies are making bank when the price is above 400, let alone 1700. Many will find profit margins take a significant hit when it does fall to 400 though, the extra capacity lines they bring on during periods of high demand have higher marginal costs. 

I’m still wagering these companies are fairly undervalued due to the overall high sustained demand for more housing in suburban and rural areas, especially considering supply conditions in general, and I believe the shift to remote work, and the houses people will want, is going to keep demand higher than expected for several years.

The trick would be: “Make it look like we’ve covered our shorts when we really haven’t (because we can’t), so that short interest falls and the Reddit army gets demoralized, thus breaking the squeeze.”

The way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.

A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock and simultaneously buy shares against the call options. The shares bought against the call options are “synthetic” longs, sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade. The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated

Over on the GME specific threads the theory is that a small fake squeeze will be initiated and that a total unknown hedge group Glacier is being margin called as a scapegoat to make retail think they won. This small squeeze isn't the real squeeze and people should hold. The stock by itself with changing over to a e-commerce model should be valued much higher than where it currently is anyways.

Not only does the Chinese-state own a significant chunk (1/10th) of the company, but they also have the most influence over the company (more than any single American entity).

The already extensive list of lawsuits against him will dramatically increase as tolerance for his fraud becomes unbearable. 

The board of SpaceX will force him out and start to pursue sensible business practices with their already amazing Falcon rockets instead of the idiotic ""I'm an alien!"" bubble dreams of this clown.
