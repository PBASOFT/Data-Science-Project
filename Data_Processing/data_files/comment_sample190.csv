&#x200B;

the issue is gene therapy is coming, and while EXEL checks all the boxes, the fear is its time of super growth is done and they need to pivot to expand their line.  This includes buying other companies, management also sells a lot of shares.

  
Now could it be a buyout?  sure the company buying won't lose money on them...but is it worth it to tie up that cash to produce cash flows?  probably not. Management would have sold.

&#x200B;

I don't believe management is aggressive enough to turn the ship into a gene therapy POWERHOUSE.

&#x200B;

Everyone bashes GILD saying cures are bad..NO cures a VERY good for business, if GILD could cure every disease they would why?  because that GOBBS of cash as everyone rushes for the cure would be insane.  Then they can use that cash to target the next/next/next.  the issue is no one has a platform to cure every disease.

&#x200B;

its possibly CRiSPR or whatever tool is being developed.  They don't have profits now, but if this platform pans out I suspect we see a big bio FIRE a MASSIVE buyout MAYBE 5-10X the price as that platform cure every disease would be the holy grail to unlock the economy.

Now that person with STDS is cured and go out and date (SPEND MONEY), the blind person can see and travel. (SPEND MONEY....everyone with a disease has a bucket list and you can GUARANTEE THEY WILL SPEND LIKE DRUNKEN SAILORS to enjoy life.  Look at covid, everyone just wanted to get out and SPEND again.  Now imagine all those hiding with diseases who are just waiting to be cured.  The market is immense.  Hence why so much money is being poured into this sector.

Biotech companies are notoriously difficult to start, don’t return profits for a long time, and are dependent on the FDA, and I’m sure the owners are just hoping to sell to Merck, Pfiszer, etc. once the time is right. Trying to commercialize something that is intrinsically out of your control and left to nature (scientific results) is extremely stressful cause you can do everything completely right for 2 decades and wind up with absolutely nothing. If I started a company like that and it wound up becoming profitable, I wouldn’t start calling myself the new Bill Gates and stick with it. I’d sell to the highest bidder ASAP.

Also love what you said about TMO. If there is one constant in my life as a graduate researcher, it is absolutely Thermo Fisher. If there is an option to buy something with Thermo, I will, even if it’s 50% more expensive. Their partnerships with research institutions like mine just make it easier to order from them than from competitors. Don’t even need to use a purchasing card - it’s all in the system. And they sell almost everything. They’re not going anywhere and if biotech grows, a small biotech company might not, but Thermo sure will. Cause almost every single item that went into conducting every experiment was probably purchased through Thermo or Sigma. And they are the masters of upchargjng for items, but have a customer base that cares less about being upcharged because “that’s just how it is in science.”",[],0

It could be that economies continue to reopen and earnings continue to bounce back. Which would still leave us at high multiples, but those would be more easily explainable by current yields. 

Put another way, the other times you saw PEs like this, we were at the end of major economic expansions, not at the tail end of a contraction.

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN) 

Trend-wise: BABA is on downtrend, AMZN is a resistance level (which one is more likely to break-out?)

Multiples-wise: BABA appears a bit cheaper than AMZN on the value side, on growth ratios like Price Per Sales, or EPS Growth, AMZN is much better.

So I wouldn't touch BABA when AMZN is right there.

It's a company that uses satellites to allow a 5G signal to your phone from anywhere on the planet (similar to Starlink but for phones). 


The killer features are that you don't need to buy ANY additional hardware like you would for Starlink, it works with any phone in existence right now.

AND they partner with existing carriers, so you don't need to switch carriers or anything to get 5G everywhere. You just pay an extra dollar a month on top of your normal bill. 


The reason why it's down is that it was recently brought public by SPAC, and the institutional investors dropped their stock as soon as it went public.

- Then the whole short squeeze started happening, and any stocks that hedge funds had so much as a single bad thought about rocketed. Not to mention, the whole short squeeze brought in a ton of new ""dumb money"". 

- Then, test flights were rescheduled. 

- All while nasdaq was going absolutely nuts to start the year.

- and SPAC euphoria (and by extension anything having to do with SPACs) were on an absolute tear.

- and growth stocks as a whole were the place to be.

Now, growth stocks are dead. Cathie has sold off all her holdings of SPCE. Nasdaq is treading water and barely up on the year, while having a terrible run the last few weeks. Inflation fears have killed growth stocks with no/bad balance sheets, and SPACs, once the darling of the retail investment community, are dead.

According to the 606 reports for the fourth quarter of 2020 for the following nine online brokers, Citadel was providing payment-for-order-flow (giving a cash rebate for trade orders directed to it) to each of the following: Robinhood, E-Trade, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, WeBull, Ally Invest Securities, First Trade and TradeStation. At Fidelity Brokerage Services, it was directing stock and option orders to Citadel Securities but was only receiving payment-for-order-flow on the option orders, according to its 606 report.

According to these 606 reports, Citadel ranked as the number one venue for sending both stock and option orders at the following firms: Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, WeBull, Fidelity Brokerage Services and Ally Invest Securities. Citadel was the number one venue for options trades by E-Trade while ranking lower for stock trades. At First Trade and TradeStation, Citadel ranked number one for market orders for stocks (trades with no stated price limit) and number one for options.

The bottom line here: there was a high probability that no matter what online brokerage firm Redditors sent their GameStop orders to initially, Ken Griffin’s Citadel Securities was getting a piece of the action in the end.

637,gz5fv76,2021-05-23,t1_gz5d4f7,stocks,"Not exactly, rather than true autonomy, the competitors are basically building out park rides that have to ""follow"" specific ""tracks"" (mapped out roads and drivable areas) that locks them into a single area. Since they only follow the tracks it's an easier problem to solve computationally. 

Eventually, the competitors will be able to map out everything, but there's a finite limit to how quickly they can do so, and there are a lot more roads that can be mapped out. The competitors will do well as long as the driver's stay within the park, but it'll be quite dangerous to go outside of it.

Tesla seeks to be able to drive pretty much anywhere. This is a much harder problem computationally and will take longer to solve. So it certainly does come down to which solves which first.

I live in a fairly rural area, I would be very surprised if any Tesla competitor becomes located in my area within the decade, as they will be focusing on cities, so they will likely become available in every city, then start mapping smaller and smaller towns before they have full coverage. Perhaps they can do something like Tesla and put mapping systems into the cars that are already driving and thus speed up the process. But in the end, the scaling problem isn't something that can be quickly resolved, though the issues on Tesla's side are certainly not trivial either, though they don't have any scaling issue. They are already operating at scale, they just need to get the software (and perhaps hardware) working as well as they would like. That is just a matter of continuous improvement.

Overall, I believe I'll see a Tesla robotaxi in use in my area before I see a non-Tesla robotaxi, though I'm certainly hard pressed to say whether it'll be a few months from now or a few years from now, though I think it is likely to be 2-5 years, mostly for regulatory reasons. Even when it is considered truly FSD, it will require probably at least a few months of data to act as evidence that it truly is better than a human before it get's regulatory approval.

I believe these have less risk than actually shorting (as long as you are careful about which you use and how long you hold it for).

Generally you don't want to hold those for long, so unless you think the S&P is going to tank within a few days.

Of course, holding this will offset some gains, so more useful if you can buy just before hand or you are 100% sure it's going to tank and you are just waiting for it to so (in which case, the 1X or 2X wouldn't be bad, as loing as you don't go too heavy into it and sell near-ish to the bottom)",[],0

The various disadvantages of LIDAR  are not a problem in a calibration run:

- **High LIDAR unit cost:** not a problem, because there are only a few calibration units.
- **Poor LIDAR performance in rain & snow:** not a problem, as the calibration runs are done in good weather.
- **Interference of many LIDAR units:** since they'll never scale this up, there's no interference in practice.
- **Health risks of LIDAR:** they don't need high power LIDAR, nor are there multiple vehicles for the LIDAR laser beams to add up.
- 
- **High mapping & map maintenance costs of 3D HD LIDAR maps**: not a problem, because Tesla is not using HD 3D maps at all - they compare LIDAR return to the neural network stack distance estimates to calibrate.
- **Poor ability of LIDAR to distinguish between surfaces, detect curbs, etc.**: not a problem either, because if Tesla's camera FSD system is calibrated for large objects that LIDAR sees well, it works for small objects and surface features as well.
- **Necessity of LIDAR units to be mounted high at the top of the vehicle to maximize angular resolution & object detection - hurting aerodynamic profile and efficiency:** not a problem, as the energy efficiency of R&D cars is immaterial.

The minimum wage if it kept up with inflation properly would be $24, finally getting $15 after years of underpayment doesn’t undo the residual damage. In addition, $15 an hour still isn’t much in most areas. And you’re still bogged down from years of incurring debt, or not being able to save. Then we have the eviction moratorium still active and student loans not active which artificially inflated outstanding cash. I currently have $7k extra cash in my account just from loan payments I haven’t had to pay. I can’t spend that money, it’s for loans, but if you look at the money supply that’s “consumer funds and savings.” Plus, back to my earlier point about supply lines not being caused by currency inflation, the price increase from supply contraction is still very real, across utilities, groceries, transportation, and a vast number of products. That increase in prices lowers the amount you have left over to produce proper spending on consumer discretionary (which is the only spending that leads to actual inflation.) If grocery prices and electricity go up 30-40%, that is money I’m not using to shop and dine.

They don't. It's all just a weird scare tactic that spread like a wildfire. People think they're smart when they find out about volatility drag, but it's only one small factor of a leveraged ETF.

There are risks to holding TQQQ shares, but volatility drag is negligible. Read the prospectus to get a list of risks. The one I'd be the most afraid of is a liquidity problem where the banks might not be able to fulfill their side of the swaps they sell to proshares.",[],0

I ask as someone who made a good profit buying GME for $80 in mid Jan and selling when it was at $330 (sadly after the main spike and not on the way up haha, but we all one day learn that you can never perfectly time the top).

The reason I don’t believe in another GME spike is because back in January, the shorts were caught with their pants down so to speak. They had been shorting GME at the $10 (and under) range, and were caught totally unawares by the price being driven 1000%+ from where it was when they shorted. 

My current belief is that these shorts (who, lets face it, are sophisticated and experienced traders who have now had months to plan and prepare their GME strategy) go in cycles of buying at the lows, helping retail drive the price up, selling those shares at the top for a profit and then opening new shorts and profiting on those as the price drops. Rinse and repeat forever for infinite money. 

In my mind, the fact that there is a high SI% means a lot less when the current price is $150 and they shorted at $170, compared to when they shorted at $5 and the price was now $200.  Plus, we saw that they are willing to literally switch off retail traders if the hedge funds need that to cover as a last resort.

I’d welcome you to challenge that view point because maybe there are other factors I haven’t considered, but my opinion is that most of the current GME diamond handers haven’t considered a factor other than “high SI%” or other people’s DDs, without considering what’s changed since January.

Either way - best of luck and don’t invest so much in GME that if it never spikes, you’re screwed.",['GME'],1

Basically if an index is negative over a period a 3x leveraged fund could lose more than 3x over the same timeframe.

[This article from the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/files/DERA_LETF_Economics_Note_Nov2019.pdf) puts it another way and shows how the risk profile of these leveraged ETFs is basically the same as buying options. Not saying options are evil, but you (presumably) wouldn't fill up your portfolio with options and treat it as a set and forget investment like a standard index tracking ETF, right?

Remember that our markets have been on a tear since \~2009 thanks to QE, so the 10yr performance of a 3X leveraged fund can look deceptively consistent.

Often these experts take about 1% per year and there are frequently stories of people being sold complicated products that were only recommended due to a higher fee. 

If you start looking into the advice from some of the world most successful investors you’ll start to see a pattern of them recommending very simple investment strategies that track with the market vs. trying to beat the market. 

Your concern about crashes is well founded. We are at an unprecedented high. Do you need that money in the next 3-6 years? If so you should sell and go to cash or some alternative. If you can let the money stay and it’s more for retirement, then leave it there, a crash will come, when a crash comes NEVER SELL AT A LOSS, after a few years the price will stabilize again. You also need to be DCA dollar cost averaging into the ups and downs, so that yea you’ve invested in only up trend for a while, but you’ll now be investing in only down trend, don’t be scared off.

That said, I messed up and bought more at 24.00. then the price dropped and I didn't HODL (can I say that here? it seems to be an industry term now lol) as long as I should have. i then bought back in.

so my official position is like 21.78 a share. but that doesn't include the loss of 69.50 because I sold. so after I went through my transaction history and calculated my ""real invested amount"" a term I'm inventing right now to describe the amount that I've actually bought minus the amount that I've sold. my real cost basis is 29.35",[],0
