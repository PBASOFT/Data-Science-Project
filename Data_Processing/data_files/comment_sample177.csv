AutoNation's growth numbers are less impressive than Lithia Motors', but they do have more long-term and better Free Cash Flow numbers.  

What I'm coming to find is that automotive retailers tend to carry a lot of debt, but interestingly enough some of that high debt is due to Floor Planning Debt.  This is a form of revolving short-term debt by which they acquire vehicle inventories.  The loans are paid as the inventory is sold, and the credit is ""recycled"" for new inventory.  

Based on the 2020 numbers, Lithia Motors' short term assets do exceed the short term liabilities.  Compared to the long term liabilities, the short term assets are greater.  They will pay down roughly $200m of the long-term liabilities in 2021, then $500m in 2022-23.

careless deregulation

debasing to special interests

a large serving of incompetence

bad-faith legislators not doing their job right

leaning on the war machine

screwing up the gov's ability to perform by messing up the budget's priorities - for instance, slashing pandemic response departments and projects and then being astonished when a pandemic hits us all like a tsunami.

It's not a coincidence that major catastrophes happen to the likes of Bush and Trump, at the same time that business regulation has been destabilized beyond breaking, and fed-level economy stabilization tools have been abused and left empty. 

Just bad decision making, on top of amateurish policy ideas, on top of legislation shifted from logic to serve special interests, on top a strained economy favoring their pet money-making grifts. The moment life throws us a curve ball the economy falls like a house of cards, and we are all left staring at each other surprised that weak policy ideas coupled with incompetence and a strong serving of grift could result in shaky conditions.

Many of these things just don't happen to Democrats. [Bush had the 9/11 plan on his desk](https://www.politico.eu/article/attacks-will-be-spectacular-cia-war-on-terror-bush-bin-laden/) for a while before it actually happen, literally a dossier saying that intelligence agencies believed terrorists were planning to fly planes into buildings. 

[Obama beat Ebola](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-usa/u-s-military-ends-ebola-mission-in-liberia-idUSKBN0LU2HR20150226) and was left scared shitless of the danger of a pandemic, so he left a very detailed pandemic response plan. Not only personnel in places to act as national and international coordinators, but a plan for various gov departments, and [forced the incoming Trump workers to do a pandemic exercise](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/488069-obama-officials-walked-trump-aides-through-global-pandemic-exercise-in-2017). Also left plans for massive PPE factories, etc. The Trump admin dismantled or defunded most of that, including losing many of his own workers that took the mandatory pandemic exercise from Obama. [The N95 mask factory cancelled](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/federal-government-spent-millions-to-ramp-up-mask-readiness-but-that-isnt-helping-now/2020/04/03/d62dda5c-74fa-11ea-a9bd-9f8b593300d0_story.html), the medical supplies warehouses left under-managed, [slashed our international CDC offices](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv/exclusive-u-s-slashed-cdc-staff-inside-china-prior-to-coronavirus-outbreak-idUSKBN21C3N5) for early warning and international coordination, etc. Even went as far as [defunding the WHO](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/14/trump-world-health-organization-funding-186786), the international coordination and relief agency, in the middle of the pandemic. These are just not things that would happen under a Democrat administration.

So in a way it sounds too simple. Poorly thought out deregulation, poorly thought out budget reallocation, poorly thought out pulling out of gov expenses that were meant to strengthen us. Combine that with gov corruption of the special interests kind, and a healthy dose of incompetence in leadership with so many positions awarded by political/personal/financial interest instead of merit, and it seems impossible to imagine that they wouldn't crash something. Give them long enough and they'll crash most anything. Foreign enemies getting a free pass, economy left without safety nets, markets and systems destabilized, and nobody competent enough to grab the reigns when things start to fall apart.

That's 12 years of Bush and Trump in a nutshell.

So in short, **how does this apply to the stock market?** 

Democrats tend to create stability. It may not always be growth, but it will move predictably.

Republicans administrations produce roller coaster type of markets. Sharp growth thanks to happy-go-lucky policy, senseless deregulation and abusing the market pumping tools; then a sharp crash at the first sign of a strong wind.

In a way, Republican administrations can be the best for major wealth growth, if you can time the market roller coaster.",[],0

82,gzq20ob,2021-05-28,t3_nmmz3r,stocks,"Hedge funds shorted the stock thinking it was going to succumb to the covid outbreak and bet it was going to go bankrupt, just like they did with companies like Toys R Us. Then a few smart folks out there noticed and spread the numbers all across media outlets. This led to a glorious community of supporters of the company that dug deeper into the technicals of what was going on and found out that some hedge funds were pumping synthetic shares (naked shorts; borrowment of a shares that get sold multiple times) into market place trying to drive the price down even further. The community rallied, bought shares and options contracts for the last 5 months and have so far made it possible for AMC to keep afloat through 2022. Their largest shareholder slowly eased out of their holdings and the community bought them all up.

To this day, the shorts have not covered their shorts (or naked shorts). In fact, they continue to short the stock. Since the stock holders own around 80% of the available common stock and likely most if not all of the synthetics, the owners are waiting for the hedge funds to cover their shorts and to buy back the synthetic shares. Multiple. Times. 

AMC is also going to do a share recall at the beginning of June to see who owns what and how many shares are actually in circulation. There should only be 493 Million. Those hedge funds who have not covered their positions are heavily leveraged and under water. It is anticipated that their financiers are going to demand they have the money in cash to balance their books. This is called a margin call. The community is in the strong belief that they cannot do this. If they cannot, their positions will be forced to liquidate, thus bankrupting the hedge fund.

Hedge funds have been doing shenanigans like this since the 1920's, resulting in one of the worse economic unravelings in the world. The internal governing body, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been writing and passing new laws and votes to curtail this behavior after the GameStop price skyrocketed. 

What is going on right now with AMC is a combination of big money manipulating the market and the retail investor going head to head. Sentiment is very high, a new factor to consider that cannot be charted.

I was at a Ford dealer yesterday just to window shop, and the GM flat out told me there's a $5k dealer mark-up on every car they have in stock.

I might have a minor thing or two wrong in my vagueness.

Markets have largely switched over to registered shares of stock that have made them easier to transfer and track ownership. When you go to Xetra you're trading either shares of the company (cross-listed) or you're trading an EDR of the foreign stock. In Apple's case, I'm not sure which it is, but I haven't seen an EDR mentioned. More on EDR later.

In both cases there are institutional investment firms and banks between the markets. They have the unique ability to buy shares in large blocks in one exchange and sell elsewhere. If demand weakens in one market, even a small bit, an institutional firm will buy up shares in the weaker market and sell in the market with stronger demand and even the price between the two markets. They earn a small amount on the price difference, but also take care of the currency conversion. There are competing institutional investment firms doing this, so the margins between the different markets is typically very narrow.

When you see the price on Xetra, you're only seeing the price as if it affected in that exchange. If the institutional firm sees a small difference in demand, they will react (and take a slither of a cut of the difference), and keep things priced nearly the same. The thing to watch out for is sometimes there could be small delays in these actions. If there is a sudden price change in the US market and not in the European market, it might take a few minutes for these institutional forms react and complete trades.  This is also some of the after-market trading you see, so you don't fully know how the other foreign market will react when they open back up, that can lead to some prices shifts when that happens. Apple is traded in many markets across the world in some form.

Of course, USD-EUR currency conversion matters in the middle of this.

&#x200B;

The other thing I mentioned was an EDR, European Depository Receipt. The American version, ADR, American Depository Receipt, has been around in some form since the 1920's.

In this case the stock is actually held by an institutional investing bank on behalf of anyone buying it in an exchange. The depository receipt is a security that represents an actual stock security held by an investment bank. It trades the same as stock and holds the same value.  The big benefit is you would buy, sell, and treat it the same as a domestic asset. If there are any taxes, conversions, or cross-border issues holding the security that is handled more efficiently by the institutional investment bank holding the actual stock security.

You still get the ownership held on your behalf, dividend, and in many cases voting rights.

Of course, any conversion costs or taxes the bank has holding of trading that security with another country will impact the cost of that EDR in your exchange. So if two nations have weird laws impacting the institutional trade of these stocks cross-borders, it becomes a cost barrier to them keeping the pricing precisely even across exchanges. That small difference happens from the institutional investor needing to make a certain value on the cross-border trades to handle those costs, when they exist.

Americans and Europeans, typically play well together.

On my side of the pond, I own shares in ABB. It is actually an ADR traded on the NYSE, so the actual share is held by an investment bank, but there is a depository receipt I hold in my name that gives me the rights to one of the shares they hold.

&#x200B;

China plays unique. They are fearful of any sort of foreign control and regulated heavily.  They have slowly been opening up, but all of these growing companies want access to capitol. 

Some companies have set up off-shore companies that invest into the Chinese company through a VIE, variable interest entity that makes a lump sum purchase into the Chinese stocks where there is no voting rights to the shareholder.

China has been allowing direct foreign ownership of lower-class shares that do not have voting rights in a few select exchanges. Hong Kong has long been a financial market that acts as a intermediary trading between China and the rest of the world. They are allowed to trade one kind of these shares that is a bit easier to trade.

So I own some BABA, Alibaba. It is an ADR that is actually buying a share in Alibaba's off-shore company in the Cayman Island's that makes a direct investment into BABA through a VIE. I can't actually directly buy stock in Alibaba, just a promise they will give me my cut and I can sell my stake through the off-shore holding company.

If I set up an account in Hong Kong or Shanghai, I can trade in those exchanges directly, but only certain lower class shares that give me no voting rights as a foreigner

I don't buy more than 5% China. They need to open up more and give shareholders voting rights and play well with the rest of the world.",['AAPL'],1

For everyone else, this will take a couple thousand off of MSRP, which is different than invoice price. Invoice price is dealer cost.


As someone who sold cars for Ford,  I can assure you,  the X Plan is nowhere close to ""dealer cost"".  
The X plan is the lowest rung of discounts and is typically reserved for friends and family members of a Ford Employee.  I.e. i know a guy that works at Ford, lemme get a discount plz. 

A-plan (current Ford factory employees), D plan (current Ford dealership employees) and z plan (retired Ford factory employees) are significantly cheaper than x plan.  


When you use one of the employee plans,  you have no negotiating power(i.e. ""no haggle""). 
Its true,  Each invoice has the X/D/A price printed on it,  but *This is not the price they paid for the car*.    
They'll gladly show you this invoice and show you how much you're saving vs the ""sticker price"", but nobody has ever paid sticker price for a car.  The ""thousands off MSRP"" is a gimmick, nothing more.  

Even when they show you the invoice, they're probably lying.  Its the ole switcharoo, they'll get a similar car thats more expensive and show you the ""invoice"" and the ""x plan discount"" vs the MSRP.   You can print this for any car on the lot, I've personally used it to show someone ""what a great deal they're getting"". 

Bottom line,  If you think the dealership is making $0 off of you, you're just the kind of fool they want to sell a car to.

The dealer has a set amount they take off the top of every vehicle they sell.  This number varies from dealership to dealership, but its usually between $500-$1000.  As a sales person, they dont pay you commission on this money.  My dealership called it a reserve, as in, i reserve $750 for myself, fuck you very much.  
As a sales person, my commission was 25% on profit AFTER the reserve, with a minimum commission of $100/unit (aka minis).  The only car we were making minis off of was the focus (we called them the fuck-us, bc we made a mini on them).  A ""pounder"" was a car we made $1,000 off of, as in this idiot bought the car at first pencil (the first bullshit price to start the negotiation) and i made a 4 pounder ($4,000).  This happened once in my car sales career (which only happened once to me). For what it's worth  I made a 2 pounder off of one of the 2 X Plan deals I sold. 

Even if they don't get you on the price (they will), they can still make money off of the back end.  
The  difference  between the interest rate you actually qualify for and the interest you pay is all dealer profit.  Most dealerships almost always get AT LEAST 2%. I fucking worked there and they still tried to pull this shit on me (I got it down to 1%). 
 Most car salesmen don't even get to see the rate (its the sales manager and finance guys job to fuck you on your interest rate).  
X plan cars don't qualify for factory incentivized interest rates (i.e. ford truck month's 0% for 60 months or 2,500 ""cashback""), so you'll pay market rate (plus at least 2%). 

Car salesmen and dealers have a knack for making customers *FEEL* like they got a great deal, thats how they make themselves seem like the good guy. I can assure you, the house always wins.",[],0

AMC Entertainment stock rocketed more than 50% higher on Thursday before paring gains a bit. But this time around, fellow meme stock GameStop wasn’t along for the ride.  
AMC shares (ticker: AMC) closed up 36% to $26.52, its highest close since May 12, 2017, according to Dow Jones Market Data. GameStop stock (GME) was up 4.9%, to $254.13. The performance gap likely isn’t due to differing views about the companies’ business prospects, but rather supply-and-demand quirks that are exaggerated by short interest, social-media excitement, and momentum-based trading activity.  
Shares of GameStop and AMC—both hugely popular among retail investors on Reddit and highly shorted by some Wall Street funds—have seen a resurgence together in recent weeks. Options activity has also picked up for both, according to Susquehanna analyst Christopher Jacobson.

With Fidelity it's an online form. On the form there will be an option to tick to let the broker calculate the gains for you.

1) they have unmaintainable bug-riddled codebase that they will struggle to build anything upon     
2) they have spent so many years on Cyberpunk, but the game is mostly a re-skin of the Witcher 3 game

Yes, they hit it big with the sales on the release, but this was done at a huge cost to their reputation and goodwill with their clients, which translates to lower future engagement and revenue.

413,gzqpqqh,2021-05-28,t3_nmmgod,stocks,"It really depends on a myriad of things. But ill make the following assumptions:

1. You have a job that can confidently pay for your home.
2. You aren't trading stock with debt
3. Option calls or puts are not being utilized
4. You are interested in diversifying assets to combat risk
5. Context will only consider selling stocks to pay for the down payment.

Try to seperate your spec stocks from your reliable stocks. If you are losing pretty heavily on spec stocks, those should be the first to go. 

Your winner stocks, you should sell with your own discretion, but the question you should ask is ""Is the stock up because there is a rally or because it is a reliable stock?"" If you feel the stock is up because of a rally then sell, if not keep.

Now if you feel like you are holding onto a good stock, but it is losing, then you have a few choices. You can sell the stock that may potentialy appreciate in value or you can sell the stock that is already appreciated. I would recommend selling the losing stock, in an effort to mitigate risk, however if you are risk tolerant then you can choose to sell your winners instead. (or a combination of the two)

That's what they want in the end, for the company to go bankrupt so they can pocket all that money. But when that same stock goes to 400 dollars in a matte of months you suddenly owe 1600 dollars. Even if the shares drop back to 200 each you will need to liquidate a lot of your portofolio to cover. The thing is they have done this hundred of times with other companies and only this one time they got caught.  When the stock price reached 20 they thought no way it goes higher, just like so many other people at the time, so what do they do? They short it again. Then it goes to 100, no way it goes higher right? Short it again. And just keep shorting. Go to r/superstonks and read the DD House of Cards I, II and III and you might be a bit more convinced.

Just look at Archegos. No one know that VIAC was being pumped by a 10:1 leveraged family fund. As soon as they were margin called, VIAC collapsed 50% of its value in 2 days. If people had known that a 10% move in VIAC would have caused a bankrupting margin call on Archegos, I don't think there would have been as many people investing in VIAC. And odds are, VIAC wouldn't have done a share offering at 10% below its price  which triggered the whole event.

 > No. The hard part of investing is holding on to your ass when you suffer a 50% paper loss. No one is too smart to suffer this, and what separates good traders from bad is how you react to the pressure cooker.

Yes, suffering a 50% paper loss is brutal. I think seeing the game-ification of my stock portfolio has warped my mind to a min/max style of behaviour. Which is a great way to get eaten by the market.

The last element that really hurt me is benchmarking. I didn't do good benchmarking, which means I didn't know how to take gains off the able when I was up, and also I cut losses after being oversold instead of averaging down and waiting for a revision back to the mean in my favourable direction.

Sorry if this post frustrated you, but I'm just trying to communicate my challenges and hope that it can help at least one more person. But you're probably right, it won't.",[],0

When your highflying stocks are outperforming VOO, take some money off the table and rebalance into VOO. If your high flying stocks are underperforming VOO, consider moving some VOO to buy those stocks at a discount.

Use VOO as a volatility hedge, and benchmark to see if you can really beat a broad spectrum index.

They have to maintain a $25K ""excess margin balance,"" meaning every night when margin is rectified they have to have at least $25k cash or they get a margin call in the morning. It's impossible to have both cash and debt, so that excess means any overnight holdings are fully paid for. 

They can trade their excess margin balance from the night before with a 25% margin requirement, meaning they can buy stock worth 4X the cash they have. They can buy and sell that as many times as they want during the day.

They also have the option to use a special tax reporting method where they report their account value at the beginning and end of the year and add or deduct the difference as ordinary income. No wash sale rule, no $3k deduction limit, no detailed listings of basis and proceeds (unless they're audited and have to prove they really are a day trader as their job and not an ordinary investor; there's no clear IRS rule defining that, so having proof of entering and exiting significant positions nearly every trading day of the year is about all that works).
