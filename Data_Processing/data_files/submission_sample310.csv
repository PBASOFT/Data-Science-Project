79,2021-05-24,stocks,"Initially, I wanted to come into this post completely unbiased, I wanted to present the bull and bear case and give you a complete overview of sentiment and questioning from both camps, but I couldn’t help myself. Let me say it out loud, SPCE has an argument to make, I’m here to answer the 3 harshest criticisms that I have heard from the easiest to most difficult. No company or stock out there is a guarantee, I am not here to sell SPCE, it is still high risk as before, but that’s the nature of space exploration isn’t it…

Critique #1 - Revenue:  The company has millions in cash, enough to continue burning for 2 years. They plan to generate income via paying customers, astronaut training, low orbit cargo/experiment carry assignments, transportation offerings, and more. If this company doesn’t see future earning possible, why would they move forward to build more ships? Why would they hire more staff? Why would there be 3+ other companies wanting to eat into their market share?? 

Critique #2 - The Competition: “SpaceX and Blue Origin are going to eat the market, leaving SPCE with zero-to-little gains.”

 \#Debunked:  Let’s start with the elephant in the room, SpaceX, Elon Musk and SpaceX have touched on space tourism and presented concepts for how to use SN for high-speed point to point travel, getting anyone from NYC to Shanghai in 4 hours, that sounds wonderful at first but let me tell you 3 points on why this is out of touch. 1. Have you heard the noise created by a SN ship? Do you think that could take off near or within NYC and all its resident would be fine with a bomb like take off? This means they cannot be anywhere near a major city… 2 When will you get on a rocket heading for outer space with just a T-shirt and flip flops? When you get into space launch, you must train to do this, you must wear an astronaut suit, the concept of just passing through security and into your flight seat as a casual experience is unfathomable for the next few years, it’s not going to happen, flights from NYC to Paris cannot happen within minimal hours without so many other factors getting in the way of that time convenience...not in a rocket at least. #3 What is the main objective of SpaceX? Definitely not a relatively small market like space tourism, SpaceX is dealing with developing a system of launch logistics that rival shipping and train systems, they have been assigned to provide a lunar lander, they have the opportunity to secure the largest and most lucrative of satellite launches, and they have tight deadlines if they want to deliver the promise of making humans live on Mars, there is so much more and simply far too important of assignments that SpaceX has in front of it to pivot and go after a smaller market segment like fun filled space tourism. Now let’s talk about Blue Origin, this is VGs biggest rival as of today, but BO is clearing behind SPCE. BO was started with the purpose of getting to the moon and making humans multi-planetary via space hotels, this vision has faded off as of late. BO was in competition with SpaceX for lunar missions and lost coveted contracts to SpaceX, the only reason why BO is in space tourism is because it could meet its original goals, it’s now pivoting out of necessity, a company mission statement is important, and BO is confused and lost. The experience that they are offing is lesser than what SPCE is proposing, their ergonomics, standard up and down flight experience, the aesthetics of the ship interior and exterior are all subpar in comparison to SPCE. They don’t have an airport to take off from…I could go on all day. VG is founded by Richard Branson, a man with a lifelong experience in hospitality, entertainment, and travel markets, BO is founded by a man who found the cheapest way to ship boxes and cancel mom and pop stores forever, if you pay any attention to the staff of a company before you invest, VG is a no brainer. VG has a CEO and upper level staff with experience in Disney, BO has upper management with experience in mechanical systems….are you noticing a pattern?….

Critique #3 - Death:  I’ve read the comments “this is a disaster waiting to happen”, “they will get canceled when thy kill somebody”….for the record, this is a great critique and justified concern, death of a client would be both heartbreaking for VG and a setback. To answer this we must look no further than other transportation and extreme entertainment industries. Let me ask you, has anyone died on a plane, in a car crash, a motorcycle, perhaps skydiving?...certainly if a death occurs on an SPCE flight due to a crash.

.....

I do not have a crystal ball, I do not offer financial advice. I just wanted to share because I hear the arguments over and over, anyone out there who is taking interest, now you know, SPCE is real. This company is a retail favorite, love it or hate it, we are all unable to look away… in an era of pent-up travel demand, the roaring twenties can only be ushered in by something as lavish as SPCE, whatever your take, wish them luck.

132,2021-05-25,stocks,"If you do not follow the mortgage sector, RKT is the market leader and reported earnings just 2 weeks ago. Their report was a miss by a penny but still made close to 2 billion dollars as a company. When RKT missed the entire sector dropped drastically. The main stocks that crashed were LDI, HMPT and UWMC. I strongly believe RKT was the culprit. Famous for being short as high as 35% just a quarter ago. I believe the sharks were still nearby and ready. The short % has not been updated since earnings and is at 7%. I believe the new short is once again at 20% or above. The very next day following earnings the rest of the sector has been attacked. The difference with these companies and most stocks, especially tech/growth is they all make serious, serious money!

**LDI makes close to 1 billion a year, just made over 300 million. Announced a special dividend of 200 million or 62 cents a share. They announced a regular dividend per share. The market cap is slightly over 4 billion. Yes, they have a PE ratio of under 4! Cash flows to buy back shares instead of using money for dividends. They have lost over 1.2 billion in market cap since RKT report.**

**HMPT just made 149 million the past 3 months. They have lost over 500 million in market cap since RKT reported. They have not announced a dividend or anything yet. The company trades at 2.5x earnings. They make cash!**

**UWMC, did the right thing makes cash and announced a 300 million buyback. I believe they have smoked out the shorts as it dipped as low as 6.25 and has recovered nicely.**

**RKT makes roughly 8 billion a year! They are valued near 35 billion and have lost over 14 billion since earninings! They last quarter gave out over 2 billion for free via a special dividend of over 1.14 per share. They have 2 billion shares! They make over $4 per share and trade under 17!!!**

LDI trades 200,000 shares daily! The stock is under 14!! Can you imagine a 100 million buyback?? They are giving 100 million via dividend and just gave 200 million special dividend they can do it!

HMPT trades just over 100,000 shares at about 6! Even a 20 million buyback will moon the stock. They just made 149 million the last 3 months!

250,2021-05-25,stocks," **Two things to start:**

1. I am not a financial advisor. What follows in my interpretation after doing much research and consulting with my broker. Consult yours before making any decisions.
2. I own 102,500 shares currently. I really don't care if they go up or down over the next few weeks. They will be worth the same regardless as I plan to hold until the Bankruptcy exit plan is concluded unless the price breaks $12.

**Now, what you came here for:** How much will I be paid for my shares of Hertz when Hertz executes its exit plan?

**There a 3 parts of the pay out:**

**1)** You will be paid $1.53 cash for each share, plus

**2)** Each shareholder will get an equity distribution on a prorated bases of 3% of the total purchase price of the entire company. Roughly $1.00 per share, plus

**3)** Then there are the warrants. A little complicated, but hope you follow. Exact wording from the agreement: ""Each Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholder, has the right, but not the obligation, subject to and in accordance with the Rights Offering Procedures, to be eligible to subscribe for up to one (1) Rights Offering Share per 0.9554 shares of Existing Hertz Parent Interests that it holds, at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, subject to the individual limits included in the calculations in Item 2 of this Subscription Form."" So for example on 100 shares you would get (100/.9554) = 104.6682018002931. Which becomes 104 warrants because all rounding is down downward. Each warrant can then be purchased for $10. Here is the tricky part. You can convert by exercising the warrant, or you can sell the warrant itself. For this example we are going to sell the warrant. And here is why nobody can give you a concrete answer because the value of the warrant is COMPLETE SPECULATION. For my example I am going to assume that the new Hertz, with its reduced debt structure and red hot rental market, will get back to a pre-pandemic level of $20 per share. So you could sell each warrant for a $10 profit. ($20 share price less the $10 warrant purchase.) *Just a note: HTZ traded for as high as $46/share in the good times, which is what the new HTZ will be entering. The good times. Low debt. Hot market.*

**So here is the math on 100 shares:**

1. $1.53 cash out (x) 100 = $153 **+**
2. $1.00 equity distribution (x) 100 = $100 **+**
3. 104 shares times $10 profit **=** $1040

Total income from you 100 shares would be $153 + $100 + $1040 = $1293. or **$12.93/share.**

If you currently owned the 100 shares for todays close price of $6.39 you investment is $639.

So staying it thru until the exit plan concludes and selling your warrants would net you $654 ($1293-$639).

**This is why I say I'm a bull on this stock. I believe that the total value of each HTZGQ share is really somewhere between $13-$20 per share. I will not sell unless the $HTZGQ crosses the $12 line before the exit plan is executed. Most estimates you see assume being able to modestly sell your warrants for about $15 per share. Which means a price of around $7-8 ($1.53+$1+$5 warrant profit=$7.53) is the total value. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SEVERE UNDERVALUE.**

***But regardless, lets just say that the $7-8 is the call. you have a more than 20% upside in the current price of $6.39.***

“I just started last week. I only play a low risk game with the top 10 companies in the SPY500 and the ETF indexes of SPY500, (VOO, VOOG) and sometimes QQQ.
I never look beyond these companies because even if one day the market crashes one day while I am
invested, basically I will be locked in for long term investments in the American economy and some companies I believe in and would love to work for in the future.

Anyway I like this 1-2 day game when I buy stocks at the dip and sell them (Like today). I use a bunch of indicators to predict red days and dips. It does not work
perfectly but works sometimes.

400,2021-05-25,stocks,"Nautilus, Ticker NLS. This company is about 20% short, has 113 million in cash in the bank with just under 15 million in debt, has a market cap of 500 million. They have generated about 80 million over the past 2 quarters as well. We have a major catalyst still….people aren’t running to the gym. If you go to Nautilus.com you will still see everything is back ordered with 6-8 weeks estimated ship date. The accounts receivables shows near 90 million on orders.

Another major catalyst is Peloton. Peloton is losing money and making a lot of acquisitions, they have spent more than the $500 million (the cost of entire NLS which is profitable). If NLS crushes again, which they will! (The question is what traders do with the report) PTON should use their beefy valuation to make an acquisition which would be immediately accretive to earnings for PTON. PTON is losing money and NLS is making money hands over fists. 

**These are just some of the 1st Quarter 2021 and some 4th Quarter 2020 highlights.**

**1st Quarter of 2021 Net Sales Increased 120% to $206 million, the highest quarterly sales in company history Operating Income of $39.7 million is third-highest in company history EBITDA was $40.4 million compared to $2.3 million last year** 

**1st Quarter of 2021 Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale securities were $113.2 million, an increase of $86.8 million, compared to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $26.5 million as of March 31, 2020.**

**Debt was $13.6 million compared to $28.4 million as of March 31, 2020.**

**Fourth Quarter EBITDA improved by 578% to $40 million compared to same period last year**

**Fourth Quarter Operating Income of $41 million is the second highest since our founding in 1986**

**On a full year**

**Company Achieves Full Year Revenue Guidance by Growing Revenue 79% to $553 million**

**Full Year Operating Income was $78 million and Full Year EBITDA was $84 million (Wait a second at $17 this company trades at $525 million….isnt that just 7x PE)**

So let us recap some of this here. This company which sells BowFlex, Schwinn and other brands is growing 120%, is making serious cash, had the best sales quarter in the company’s history and trades basically near 6PE. This past quarter was the 2nd most profitable quarter in its history after the 4th quarter of 2020. This has pulled back from $30 about 4-5 months ago after 2 amazing reports. You will not find 120% growth in profitable stocks. I understand that eventually maybe 2-4 quarters down the road the growth will slow. But the company has forecast this quarter at 50%....I believe that is modest..

Also, PTON is going to lose about $200 million because of their treadmill fiasco. NLS doesn’t have a fiasco, if anything PTON should plug that issue and make a purchase. PTON with BOWFLEX! The possibilities…

[VW Outlines the Math Behind Its Autonomous Service Plans](https://ark-invest.com/newsletters/issue-271/?utm_content=168006531&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-2398137084)

> In a recent interview, Klaus Zellmer, Board Member responsible for Sales, Marketing and After-Sales at its passenger car division, said that if Volkswagen launches an autonomous service, it could charge vehicle owners 7 euros per hour and hit profitability. If the cars on its platform were to average 30 miles per hour, vehicle owners would pay 29 cents per mile for the autonomous service in addition to the 70 cents per mile to drive personally owned gas-powered cars today, the two costs summing to roughly $1 per mile. While less expensive than the average taxi today, according to ARK’s estimates robotaxis at scale will be priced profitably at only 25 cents per mile.

> Charging vehicle owners per hour is a telling go-to-market strategy for VW’s autonomous taxi platform. ARK believes that personal car ownership will dwindle, if not collapse, as autonomous taxi networks proliferate and prices drop to only 25 cents per mile. Rarely do taxi rides last an hour or more, suggesting that VW is likely to transition to a per mile price if its autonomous strategy meets with success.

> While it has had some false starts, Volkswagen now seems to be making strides in transitioning from a legacy auto manufacturer to a software enabled, autonomous electric future. ARK will continue to monitor VW’s progress.

Why is ARK Invest still emphasizing autonomous driving technology?

The bull case for Tesla (TSLA) has always been much stronger on the second-life energy storage front than on the autonomous driving technology front.  Only today is Tesla reconsidering its earlier rejection of lidar technology, but that's because there has been a credible embrace of it.

Tesla has made its bet with Luminar Technologies (LAZR) because [Volkswagen has embraced lidar technology and made its bet with Argo AI](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/naooit/electric_vehicle_volkswagen_embraces_lidar_for/).

Nonetheless, just like with Tesla, the [bull case for the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mnxdex/oops_dd_underestimated_volkswagen_by_2025_could/) is, in my opinion, much stronger on other fronts: scale, charging networks, bidirectional charging technology, the company's own planned foray into second-life energy storage, and so on.",nkehy3,[],0

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

922,2021-05-25,stocks,"Hi all, are you aware of any database of historical price estimates that doesn't cost a fortune? I'd like to run some python analysis to separate the wheat from the chaff, but the only one I've found (Quandl) costs a delightful 1.2k. 

If you are aware of one and willing to share I am happy to share my findings :)

From the sample data on Quandl you can see that predictions for some instruments are actually not too bad, but some are way off

Now I'm aware that analyst price target are like opinions and a-holes, everybody has one, but I'd like to see if there is some usable meaningful correlation somewhere where some alpha can be extracted :)",nkmxj6,[],1

981,2021-05-25,stocks,"Hi everyone!  I know some of you are very experienced with stocks, researching information about them and doing your own dds. I am really interested in knowing more about what you research and find valuable as information when you look at stocks. I am a small youtuber that would like to provide the best videos for people like you interested in the stock market and I thought it would be nice to know what you expect to see in videos about that!

* When you are researching a stock, what do you usually take a look at? Do you just do research on google and see where it takes you, or do you have a usual way of proceeding?
* Do you often go on YouTube to learn more about a stock? If you do, what do  you usually expect from a video you are watching? Is it more general information like how the business works, what the industry looks like, what are the financials? Or is it more for technical analysis with charts and everything?
* When listening to a video, what is the most crucial information you want to have to feel like the video was not a complete waste of your time?
* Finally, is there anything you love from certain youtubers that make you come back? Or that you hate and make you never click on their video again?

I would really appreciate it if you could answer some of these questions, or just your general opinion would help me provide people with the best content (and provide content that they are actually looking for!!)

Thanks a lot in advance!",nknrag,[],1
