VG is the only real company seriously pursuing space tourism. They are the industry, this is pretty much all they do, and they only have one type of rocket. One catastrophic occurrence and the company is tits-up for years, if not a decade. All the other examples you gave are retarded irrelevant.   


Boeing's Max 737 is good comparison in some respects. After the crashes, the jet was grounded for a couple years and they've been going through hell to convince people that it's now ""safe"" again. Did it kill their business? No, because this particular jet is only a small piece of their business -- they took a substantial hit, though. Did it kill the industry? No, of course not. There's a myriad of other passenger jets that have nothing to do with the issues of the Max 737. Neither are the case with VG, AT ALL.

I recommend AMD to my friends when it was $28 a share. I road it up to the mid 80’s and got out.

I suggested my friends were nuts if they didn’t buy as much Microsoft as they could when it dipped into the $150’s a few months back. Right now Microsoft is at $251.56. I double my money on this one.

I suggested LHX when it was bouncing up and down between $160 and $180. I originally bought LHX way back in 2001 when it was in the $30’s and bought a bunch more during the above $160 to $180 rut ride... Today it’s sitting at $216.45! 

Target is another that I picked up in the $130’s...

You attend meetings in some dude's basement that you're pretty sure is used for either ritual sacrifices or weird sex shit based on how it's dimly lit by candles and the iron handcuffs hanging from the ceilings. You roll your eyes every time the guy in the blood red cloak and hood talks about the rewards you'll receive in the afterlife if you just pledge your loyalty and donate your wealth to the cult. Your friends and family all make fun of you and call you a dumbass. 

A couple months later, you don't know how things got so out of hand but you're being pressured by the entire cult to drink the cyanide-laced Kool-Aid with them so you can all ascend to the promised land. You decide fuck it, you already lost your life savings in OTM FD's and the rest went to the cult so you could keep banging the same chick, who's been passed around multiple other members, and you've been pretty depressed so what do you have to lose? You chug down your portion out of a plastic Chuck-e-Cheese mug and then die in agony.

Pitch black nothingness. All of a sudden you feel warm sunshine on your face and smell a fresh ocean breeze mixed with the scent of mom's cinnamon buns. You open your eyes and wake up in the muscular arms of the god Thor. He whispers into your ears, ""It was all true, welcome to Valhalla."" He leads you to your yacht where you find 100 big bosomed women, every single one the most gorgeous you've ever seen, and all desperate to snort your unlimited supply of cocaine off your massive 12"" penis (you were only 3"" before).

You can exchange them for cash.  
They make very little interest over time.  
It’s what banks use to get cash from the treasury when they need liquidity.

The Chinese government is one of the biggest holders of Treasury bonds.  
If Treasury bonds crash and the US government can no longer finance its’ massive debt then China will be left holding the bag.

So why put your money into Treasury bonds if they are tied to cash? (which the government can dilute by printing more of it)

Both political parties have shown themselves to be fiscally irresponsible.  The national debt will no longer be able to be financed at some future date.  My take is that we are over-leveraged from a national debt perspective.",[],1

Lumber is vital for most projects.

When framing, you could use metal 2x4s but you don’t want to frame a whole house out with them.

The biggest thing I’ve seen is building decks, where as most people would use lumber, the alternatives such as azek, which is generally much more expensive, is now similarly priced.

If you want a good bet, I’d actually find a way to do long puts on lumber, once supply comes back in full

All the stuff you mentioned other than floors: brick, stucco, hardi siding, vinyl. Are all exterior finish products. You still need to have the bones of the house to install those things. You still need to sheathe your exterior walls to put up vinyl siding or hardi plank. In a lot of markets, the walls are sheathed with OSB which is an engineered wood product made from lumber, like plywood in a sense, but cheaper. Now that it’s skyrocketed people have started using the less popular but still structurally-sound foam board for exterior wall sheathing. You need some extra bracing and still need osb/plywood in certain areas, but the majority of the sheathing can be foam board, which actually insulated better than OSB/plywood, so will be better for energy efficiency in the long run. People just don’t like it because they don’t want to imagine their house is “made of foam” even though it’s just wxterior sheathing.

Wood flooring was already becoming increasingly more and more unpopular because it was already expensive, and high maintenance. They’ve advanced the vinyl plank flooring products to the point that they are very durable, and look like real wood while being easier to maintain.

They announced a $1.2b offering only weeks after going public! What a fucking scummy thing to do.

And why the fuck do they need $1.2b for? They are literally a software company with 1 ""app"". They have minimal overhead. 

They do not hold any physical inventory, they do not have factories to build. They do not have any physical presence apart from some leased office buildings.

The majority of their costs is personnel & servers etc.

$1.2b is enough to hire 1,800 employees and keep at ~$130k each for FIVE YEARS.

NVDA currently has 1,400 job postings, and their average salary is right around $130k.

So exactly why would they need $1.2b???

COIN is worse than Uber. They bring in tons of revenue and still bleed red because of poor management who cannot handle fast growth.

COIN doesn't even offer DOGE.

Do not consider COIN as a long term investment, don't even consider it an investment. It's is a scam.

Just to clarify, that means that a solid outgrown value company would give easily 50-60% of your investment as a dividend in the next year.

A company like AMD would trade at a single digit P/E ratio. Giving you at least a 10% pa profit completely without any future growth at all.

The S&P seen YoY seen returns of about 20%, well within the returns it usually sees when it doesn't fall into a bear market, which tends to be about 15-35%.

Another arguement often thrown around is how similar this looks to the dotcom bubble. The difference between the 2 is that, at the height of the dotcom bubble, the Nasdaq had a P/E of 200. Right now, that number sits at 40.

One of the final arguments I hear is that we seen a lot of money printed this year, and QE will have to stop. While there is an argument for out-of-the-ordinary inflation to be made, I don't see it. CPI numbers were carried by used car sales, that became evident when PPI numbers were released, and retail sales were dismal. The argument that the printing of money will lead to inflation has proven itself to be a weak one, as inflation depends more on money velocity. In a time where investing is far easier than it was 10 years ago, I think a lot of money printed is being sent into assets for peoples' futures. It's worth noting that QE was implemented following the 2008 financial crisis, and it led to the bull run that brought us to where we stand today.",[],0

You can bet your bottom dollar, autonomous vehicles will be mandated to include Lidar. I think you projected on me a moment ago. Big companies, use government to legislate small companies out of business. Sometimes big companies unify against an emerging market, even if it solves a problem. For example the vaping industry, has all but been decimated by big pharma and big tobacco. It’s a product with promising results on health, especially those with COPD and such. The Royal College of Physicians tested vaping vs  traditional tobacco and found it 98% safer than traditional tobacco. You don’t hear that kind of story here in the US though, do you?  That is crony capitalism... It stifles solutions and picks the winners. Capitalism let’s people decide by voting with their wallet. This government stomps that out before it can happen, because Corporate entities stand to lose billions. Same thing with the oil industry. You don’t think there’s been other solutions to gas? Most have never seen the light of day. Interesting fact: The inventor of FM radio killed him self due to suppression of his invention.

They changed some of their executives, stated a goal to transition to online commerce (which should have happened years ago) and got rid of some debt. They were definitely undervalued at $4, but let’s say they were 100% undervalued. That puts them at $8. Now let’s say those changes they made allow the stock to grow another 500%. Which is insane, but let’s just go with it. That would put the stock at $40 a share. Right now it’s trading at almost $200 a share. The math just doesn’t check out to me.

I see that as a bad thing. When you have a strong person holding a lot of shares that creates a good support.

The fact is, when you look into ATVM loans, is that plenty of manufacturers who have applied for them have gone through extensive due diligence and it has gone nowhere. Just remember Steve Burns talked about the ATVM by Workhorse and they never got one there. To be clear, I am not sure how you determine that it looks promising to get a loan that I don't think has been given to anyone since the program opened about a decade ago (they gave then to Tesla and Faraday Future among others). How about search Google for Lucid and the ATVM loan. They went through extensive due diligence for it to go nowhere as well. Anyone relying on the ATVM loan at this time is simply gambling. If they need that money they need to have plans to get it elsewhere before they extend themselves to far waiting for the ATVM.

As to the factory, well there was a question about what sort of borrowing base they have there and I think they did not answer that (correct me if I am wrong). They bought the factory for about 20 million. They have put in and updated machinery that probably can be resold for a few million more (tens or hundreds... I have no idea). No bank is going to lend them against the factory based on the cost of building a factory from scratch (how the billion dollar factory value comes up), rather they have to figure based on what they could sell the property for which is way less.

Whatever mate.

I now potentially have the right to exercise for 200 shares instead of 100. If the squeeze really takes off at some point before NOV I might be able to sell a very low number of shares during the squeeze and in turn exercise those options for an additional 200 shares.

“Gamestop as a company has made only basic changes to what they are and what they do since they were trading at $4 a share. They changed some of their executives, stated a goal to transition to online commerce (which should have happened years ago) and got rid of some debt. They were definitely undervalued at $4, but let’s say they were 100% undervalued. That puts them at $8. Now let’s say those changes they made allow the stock to grow another 500%. Which is insane, but let’s just go with it. That would put the stock at $40 a share. Right now it’s trading at almost $200 a share. The math just doesn’t check out to me. It’s not that *it could* drop, it’s that I fully expect it to drop. Why would I buy something that I think should be trading significantly lower than it is?”",['GME'],0

This successful test flight was significant for a few reasons

&#x200B;

1. It was the first flight from the new Spaceport America in Las Cruces, NM
2. It was the first flight with a paying customer (not a person, but some [NASA](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/22/virgin-galactic-completes-third-spaceflight-of-vss-unity.html) testing equipment)
3. They promised a test flight in May AND DELIVERED
4. It proved that they can fly (first flight in 2 years) with the new VSS Unity
5. The CEO then announced 3 more flights this summer
   1. Another test flight (in 2-3 weeks)
   2. Next [Sir Richard Branson](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/22/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-flight/) himself will be onboard
   3. The Italian Air Force is sending some future astronauts up for a training/joy ride

Basically the flight moved SPCE from a theoretical/speculative stock towards (Although not all the way) to become an operational company with cash flow. If these three flight work...2022 will see at least 200 flights scheduled and [celebrity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesasquith/2020/02/26/tourists-in-space-justin-bieber-and-leonardo-dicaprio-have-already-purchased-tickets-as-demand-skyrockets/?sh=67f8f0b241a9) clients to include Leo DiCaprio and Justin Biebers",['SPCE'],0

As far as the institutions that bet against it, some of those funds posted big losses last quarter already. And besides that, those funds use algos to trade. They enter and exit trades tons of times per second and their short positions probably aren’t as far OTM as a lot of people seem to think. I just don’t see it being likely that these massive hedge funds are trapped by short positions and retail is gonna force their hand. I think it’s way more likely that the >10,000% jump in January was a squeeze and the shorts covered at some point after that. 

If it squeezes again, I’ll be happy to admit I’m wrong. But for the last couple months there’s just been a ton of insane theories based on misinformation or mistruths pushed as “DD” on those single stock subs and a ton of new traders who don’t know what they’re talking about pushing misconceptions. There are constantly new dates being set as “the big squeeze” and every time those dates come and go and nothing happens, a new date just gets set another few weeks or a month out or something. If you go to the gamestop sub now they’re talking about some thing happening in a couple weeks from now, I’ve even seen it mentioned here in WSB. And when it comes and goes and there’s no squeeze, someone will come up with a new date and all the GME Anon people will latch on to that.",[],0
