10,2021-05-20,algotrading,"Hi everyone,

for a grad level Machine Learning Class I recently completed, I built a decision tree to predict whether  a stock from the 30 companies in the DOW would return 0.5% or more by end of a week using the previous 6 weeks of data.

Our data was limited to the 2011 Q1 and Q2 Dataset, and just included Weekly stock price, volume, days to dividend, and % dividend. we trained on Q1 and tested on Q2.  We found our tree performed best using an RSI indicator, MACD indicator, Previous Week Price Change, previous 6 Week price change, days to dividend, and % dividend return.

Moving forward, despite overfitting with too many parameters being a constant theme that people warn about (with good reason I'm sure), I'd like to try building some huge trees/neural networks using just about as many attributes as possible and then start eliminating those that seem to do more harm than good.

Like before I will be choosing from the DOW, but I'll be incorporating other factors.  Previously my only live Algotrading has been with crypto, and frankly has been very frustrating.  I've learned how TA indicators really are just a little better than a coinflip, and there are much fewer attributes to incorporate with Cryptos as opposed to an actual stock in a company.  Hence why I'd like to try incorporating as many attributes as possible since I've felt really limited to just TA indicators with crypto trading.  

I've listed all the parameters I want to start pulling data for below, but please add any that I have not thought of.  Please feel free to give any advice on how to best apply these indicators (eg, how long of a moving average should I use for tracking Number of Mentions in Social Media? 2 days? Hourly? Weekly?....)  Also feel free to point out if any of my suggested attributes are particularly important or totally useless.  Thanks so much for any insight! It will save me countless hours working with data that winds up being completely useless

&#x200B;

Currently, the list of params I think I would be useful and want to incorporate:

1) Use of 2-3 Technical Indicators at Most 

 \-> This is probably my biggest concern.  From what I've read on here, using multiple TA to make a tree  or neural network is essentially just mutating the same data over and over again, which doesn't produce distinctly different attributes that will improve prediction accuracy

\->That being said, I would think 2-3 TA indicators can help establish a positive market trend , and define whether the trend is long or short term (eg 2 week avg is above 200 day avg, and a positive MACD, I would consider a valuable set of attributes that Stock is Bullish). 

2) P/E Ratio.  This an obvious useful tool for company fundamentals.  

3) Related Raw Materials Costs (e.g. my neighbor works at a Brewing Company and mentioned how high aluminum costs and no bars pouring drafts means more canning, which has been cutting into profits despite record sales)

4) Overall Market Trend (is DOW/S&P bearish or bullish)

5) Relationship to Similar Companies (e.g. is Coke lagging behind Pepsi? Do we expect Coke to Rise or Pepsi to Crash, or both?)

6) Scan internet for major News Outlet Mentions (e.g. Did Jim Cramer recommend on his show?)

7)  Sentiment Analysis and Popularity Growth from Reddit,Twitter (is it increasing or decreasing? Is sentiment mostly positive?)

8) VIX to incorporate risk due to volatility, help define higher/lower bail thresholds

9) Strike Prices and Expirations Dates of Puts/Calls (essentially applying the Max Pain strategy where major Hedge Funds that sell options try to manipulate prices to not go above/below a certain range to ensure the vast majority of options expire worthless.)

10) Depth Charts to view major sell/buy walls

11) Days to Dividend, % Dividend Return

&#x200B;

\*As  a side note, I wanted to mention that I've found Volume to be completely useless attribute, but perhaps I'm not using it right.  Even if I'm able to see if most of the buying is Maker side (which is not always available info), I already can tell because the price is increasing, as one would expect.  The price and Buy Volume I've found are essentially just the same data, if buy volume increases, price increases proportionally.  The only strat I've heard that uses volume that sort of makes sense is that big money Firms tend to increase volume substantially, while keeping price as unchanged as possible, and eventually reduce supply until price eventually does jump.  Other than that, I've yet to find a way to use volume effectively, but please let me know if I'm completely missing something here.

&#x200B;

Thanks for any advice!

&#x200B;

I guess I'll make this short and sweet - though I'm not an algotrader (Im a junior engineer who likes playing with data), I wanted to do some analysis on historic stock prices (unfortunately as of now I can only do full day quotes - but looking to expand that) and after all sorts of frustration and rate limits and all these non free API's I quickly got distracted and wanted to solve that problem instead more than the data I wanted to look at. 

&#x200B;

my creation - [https://github.com/Stonks/tickers](https://github.com/Stonks/tickers)

NYSE - [https://github.com/Stonks/tickers/tree/main/tickers/nyse](https://github.com/Stonks/tickers/tree/main/tickers/nyse)

NASDAQ - [https://github.com/Stonks/tickers/tree/main/tickers/nasdaq](https://github.com/Stonks/tickers/tree/main/tickers/nasdaq)

&#x200B;

I've created a repo that will update every 24 hours with the latest (and basically all the past data since their listing) of all the stocks in the NYSE and NASDAQ. Currently it just outputs it into a CSV, but for those who fancy using it as an API to just sloppily fetch all the data, I'll be having it publish json as well (hopefully I'll get it done tomorrow lol)

&#x200B;

I know its nothing super special, but I figure for those who like to mess around with the data and aren't interested in getting railed in API fees maybe this will help with that :)

This turned longer than I expected - hope this helps at least one person!

The over the last four years, through endless ideas & projects, I've taken a taken keen interest in the stock market. I believe it started the days when Shopify (SHOP) was $86 a share. Anyway, I've been long journey where I'm discovering more about every day. There were early days where I thought... let me follow social media callouts for the latest trending ticker, but I'd left then I'd be left holding a bag at the end of the morning pump. Then there was... if study this chart pattern enough, I can predict the price movements, but you find a lot of indicators give a lot of false signals. I did found some success with trading with the trend. However, years later and what I’ve learned along the way, I just can't shake the knowledge knowing that psychology drives a lot of the movements in the market. We see it all-to-often, where bad / good news-based event moves a ticker 30% in either direction on a single day. 

The stock market doesn't care if I lose hundreds of dollars, it's robotic and it's relentless.  The more I inject any sort of emotion into it, the more I lose.  I decided to take my feelings out of the equation, and utilize what I know... automation.

**What did I decide to do?** I've decided to spend the last week focusing on sentiment analysis of press release headlines. I decided to look at headlines and the correlated OHLC data for healthcare sector related stocks; then hooked the data up to a ML algorithm doing text classification.  I also removed any headlines from any 'opinion' or recommendation websites.

**What did I find?** A whole lot of nothing for the short-term, but insights for the long-term. It’s hard to find any useful data in vague press release headlines, the real meat is in financial report or the press release article body. I did learn you might be better off in a lot of cases doing short selling. The fear of losing your hard-earned money is a is a great motivator to sell off people’s positions.

**Where am I going from here?** I'm going to look into classifying earnings reports (not an easy feat) or doing simple intraday EMA cross strategies for a  bot that I'm working on. 

I collected the news headline, time that the headline was posted, headline source and daily open & close price for 700 health care related tickers. The data set is approximately 39,000 entries. I figured it might help someone who is looking at sentiment analysis for any projects they might be working on.

741,2021-05-22,algotrading,"Hello all,

I am doing some forecasting for my MSc thesis and have managed to get some pretty good 1-day ahead forecasts using an LSTM and some engineered features, with accuracy in the range 70% upward. My worry is that I am actually overfitting and just using the previous days price/return as the forecast. 

Obviously I want to check if this is the case. So I computed the correlation between the predicted returns and the true returns and get a correlation of 94.6%. When I compute the correlation between the predicted return and the 1-day lagged actual returns the correlation is 0.3%, leading me to believe that in fact I am NOT copying the previous days return. Are there any other ways I can check this?

I have an algo made for trading SPY and I wanted to calculate the beta so got a list of monthly returns of SPY and the returns of my algo and then used the slope command in excel but it returned -4 (lol) which is clearly incorrect.",nigsxf,[],0

It looks serious and worth it. 

Thank you!",niqu1p,[],1
