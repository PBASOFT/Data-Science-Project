35,2021-05-18,investing,"Hi folks. 

I'm not optimistic about stocks lasting much longer due to our debt-fueled climate!

Rather than shorting the DOW and/or S&P 500 directly, I'd like to find stocks that are reverse-correlated to them, seeing as I can hold these stocks as long as you like as opposed to shorting.

Do you know any stocks that you know to be reverse correlated to either of these?

Thank you! Have a lovely day!",nfopv6,[],1

126,2021-05-18,investing,"Long story short, I quit my job in 2019. I was making great money but it was a very stressful situation and my health was deteriorating from the stress. So, I decided to take some time off.  I had been working for 15 years until that point and have done a good job saving aggressively and investing. The plan was to take a couple months off and then start looking for another job - the vision was it to be a total of 6 months of sabbatical.  It so happened to be that the pandemic hit and my unemployment ended up going a lot longer. However, even though not working for an employer, I am actually doing a quite a lot of things day to day. I have picked up some freelance consulting, I own an investment residential property which I rent out for 2x return (rent compared to mortgage) that I have now taken the responsibility to do the property management (instead of hiring someone), I have picked up on trading options and I have done well with my stock choices (I guess everyone has since the market was in such a crazy bull run) but I have exited many stocks with 3 or 4x returns. I have also lost on a few but the net gain has been solid.  I also have an additional source of income through dividend stocks.  All together, while it might seem to an outside viewer that I am doing nothing, I am actually doing a lot. 

I have enjoyed my day to day life quite a bit doing all of these various things and I actually have made more than enough money to cover my expenses and have money left over for savings and discretionary income.  Is there anyway that I could consolidate all of these activities under some sort of an investment company? Or a holding company? Or perhaps an LLC? If my rental property continues to do well, I would ideally love to add another one. My options trading has also been a secure sense of basic income because I use very low risk strategies which allows me to make modest gains off of my options trading. It all adds up of course, and along with the free lance consulting, I believe I am making enough money for the time being. But, it would be nice to make all my activities into something consolidated and more professional. This way, if and when I do return to applying for jobs, it would also look better on my resume to consolidate all this work into some sort of professional entity instead of just describing all the various activities I was doing when unemployed.

I would appreciate any advice anyone has for me. I am aware that many of these investment activities can go up and can go down and that is why I want to retain the prospect of again applying to jobs at some point.",nfpy1v,[],1

PFMT price Target= $8  (low end)

Despite the ongoing rally in the broad market, this stock continues to be insanely undervalued.... but the window of opportunity to own it at current levels is closing.  I wont go over old news, the original DD link can be found below.  This post lays out immediate short term catalysts that will attract institutional investor attention to the name leading to a multiple re-rate higher.

&#x200B;

On May 13 the company reported earnings. The stock reaction has been muted due to low volume. The intense volatility in the name has slowed, as a FEW sophisticated  investors have accumulated meaningful starter positions (emphasis on only a few).  The earnings release and recent news has addressed and alleviated the lingering concerns by investors over:

\-Student loans business- Contracts are being sold off.  Company will focus on healthcare business

\-Debt- covenents have been renegotiated into more favorable terms. Proceeds from sale of Student Loans contracts will be used to pay off some debt to the point of easily manageable levels

\-Healthcare business- continues to grow. More contracts secured. Mgmt also confirmed a robust pipeline of new contracts in the works. Margins expected to be 30% sustainably once we re-open

&#x200B;

Like everyone, the quarter was impacted by covid. no surprise. The first unaffected quarter will be rockstar- hitting the screens of all investors that are currently unaware. As a turnaround story these companys cannot be easily found.

1)

On the conference call, we see for the first time two institutional investor participants.

Chris Krug- Chatham Harbor Capital (AUM unknown)

and

Craig Melcher- Tudor Investment Corporation (AUM 45B+, even small cap funds would have significant size)

&#x200B;

During the conference call, these investors asked critical questions ot which management provided reassuring feedback and responses. What we draw fomr this is that new players in the institutional landscape are vocally following this name.

&#x200B;

2)

A few days ago, the institutionally well-followed podcast known as The Contrarian Investor Podcast recently hosted an episode with Chris Krug above. (Link: [https://contrarianpod.com/](https://contrarianpod.com/)) in which Chris pitches PFMT as a table punding buy. Fast forward to 15 minutes 40 seconds. I recommend everyone listen to this pitch as he does an excellent job of simplifying a complicated company. Especially helpful for those sitting on the fence unsure whether to buy stock.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

An exclusive online investing network known as CoInvestor Club ([https://coinvestorclub.com/](https://coinvestorclub.com/)) , followed by a many of NOrth Americas top hedgefund, micro/small/mid-cap portfolio managers, and high networth accredited investors has recently announced in their weekly newsletter and posted on twitter (@CoINvestorCLub1) that they will be hosting Chris Krug TOMORROW Wednesday May 19 to present his BEST investment idea- no other details shared.  Given the recent events, it is very likely that Chris continues to pitch PFMT. Volume uptick into the close today confirms this could be the case.

&#x200B;

These new investors see the underlying value in Performant and have clearly done a thorough due dilligence. Expect a sophisticated educational campaign to initiate in the insitutional investing world. These are no longer small retail investors but large funds that will push the price much higher. Tomorrows presentation is only the begining. Expect many value and micro cap investors to be tuning in. Once PFMT is confirmed to be the best idea, expect a pop in the price. As well as continued spreading through word of mouth, mgmt appearing at investor conferences to generate exposure to investors. This was a $1B market cap company not too long ago.  This could be the last opportunity to buy this turnaround company at cheap levels before the coming multiple re-rate bring it to $8+ or it gets acquired at a significant  premium.",nfqeqy,[],1

This might not be strictly investing as the economy is not the stock market and the stock market is not the economy. In fact, this is just me creating conversation as I want to know the opinion of the community. Nonetheless, it does help to look at the current economic cycle we are in and what the future holds for the economy the companies we invest in are also part of. I was just talking to a fellow investor who says the economy is in an awful place and said he is cash hoarding. All things which were obscene to me as inflation is coming and cash is trash during inflation and because inflation is a sign of a ramping up economy considering the demand we are facing. I explained all this to him to no avail. He also mentioned the high unemployment, which I explained could go down as people are prepared to return slowly in particular when schools return and they can drop off their kids at school and go work. All in all, I could not convince him and he remained pessimistic. Therefore, I want to know what you guys think. Could be a total shit post and if that’s the case sorry.",nfqvlo,[],0
230,2021-05-19,investing,"I’m (F23) so lost when it comes to this stuff, but do all banks/credit unions make you sign paper work EVERY time you want to deposit money into your IRA? Whether it be cash or check? I recently got one and they didn’t tell me I had to make an appointment every time. Then I was told I had to set up time to sign paper work each time. I called a week later to confirm, and they told me “as long as you are preset when depositing cash, you can put it straight into your IRA (no paperwork). No one else can do it for you.” 

I just went to deposit cash into it and they tell me I still need an appointment. I told them that I was told different. It’s only frustrating because I work two jobs Monday-Friday and it’s nearly impossible for me to set up an appointment every single time. I start/finish one job the same time my bank open/closes.

503,2021-05-19,investing,"Halfway through 2021, retail investing has reached a peak volume we have never seen before. In fact, the average amount of trades happening each day has more than doubled since 2019. Trillions of dollars are moved as stocks rise and fall throughout the day. However, even though stock prices change at all hours, US retail traders are restricted to the narrow timeframe of 9:30 AM through 4:00 PM EST.

The restrictive trading hours placed upon retail traders is just one of the many issues with the current system. Some of the other problems have been brought to attention due to recent events, such as the meteoric rise of GameStop stock and Dogecoin. In both cases, many different stock brokerages used by retail traders restricted the buying or selling of specific securities, effectively manipulating the market.

Time and time again we have seen larger investment institutions place rules and regulations on ordinary traders, while giving themselves the freedom to do whatever they want. Our goal? Level the playing field.

**Our vision**

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) represents a massive amount of wealth and equity. It has a market cap of 26.2 trillion dollars and is easily the largest stock exchange on the planet. However, if you’re able to freely trade with all the stocks within the NYSE, you’re still only able to trade with roughly a third of the global stocks.

There are dozens of other stock exchanges out there using dozens of different currencies. However, the time-zone and currency differences make accessibility difficult. We see a world where anyone can trade on any stock exchange, regardless of their currency, at any time they wish. At first glance, it may seem idealistic, or a far reach. But in reality? It’s already here.

**What is StockSwap?**

StockSwap is the stock market reimagined, with the power of investing held equally by all parties for the first time in history.

On StockSwap, you can purchase any stock you want, just like on any other platform, but without any of the restrictions.

**How does it work?**

StockSwap is possible through the developments of cryptocurrencies and blockchains over the past several years. When you buy a stock on StockSwap, you are exchanging your money for a wrapped cryptocurrency token that is directly tied to and backed by your desired stock, purchased by us. This means you retain voting rights, receive dividends, and keep any other benefit of directly owning the stock yourself.

**How can I start?**

If everything you’ve read so far sounded appealing, that’s fantastic. But while we’d like our platform to be perfect, we’re not quite there yet. Before you can start trading with us, there’s a few things you should know.

**Where are we now**

As we work towards perfecting StockSwap, all trades have a 1% fee placed on them, capping at $10 to help cover our developmental and maintenance costs. We understand nobody wants to pay money to invest and are working on further reducing those fees as we progress, with our ideal scenario consisting of phasing them out completely in the near future.

In addition, while StockSwap is already developed and fully functional, we are still finishing the process of obtaining our broker dealer license. Before completing this step, SEC regulations require the investment portfolio of any potential client to be greater than 10 million USD. This means, while we’re currently serving several dozen clients, it’ll be at least a few more weeks before we’re able to able to help everybody trade freely.

Until then, keep up to date on our progress through our medium and telegram pages. We can’t wait for you to join us on our journey as we reimagine how we invest.

Until next time!",nfwhkl,[],0

806,2021-05-19,investing,"Hey all, I’m doing a series where I breakdown and simplify popular option strategies while trying to be as concise yet comprehensive as possible. For today, we’ll be breaking down the Long Straddle Option Strategy as it has come to my attention that TSLA has been edging closer to a point where this strategy could seem increasingly favourable for those highly uncertain of its directionality. I will be covering the basics of the long straddle strategy and hence this is in NO WAY any form of investment advice to tell you to trade Tesla or to advise you to use any strategy on any underlying whatsoever. 

A long straddle is a directionally unbiased option strategy that involves the purchase of a Call option and a Put option of the same strike price. A long straddle is often set up when a trader speculates that the stock will move in a volatile manner but is uncertain as to which direction the underlying may break out from. Hence a trader would set up a straddle to be able to profit if the underlying breaks out in either direction. However if the stock remains stagnant at expiration, the trader will lose money. [Long straddle trade diagram](https://optionliteracy.com/?page_id=518#longstraddlediagram)

Long straddles are typically set up At The Money(ATM), which means buying a call and put that have the same strike price as where the stock would be trading at open of the trade. Take a look below as to how a long straddle is constructed. Stock EEE is trading at $200 at open of the trade.

* March 16/21 Long 200 put- $5.00
* March 16/21 Long 200 call- $5.00

**Max loss** 

A straddle’s max loss is the price paid for the put + the price paid for the call. This is called the total debit paid. In this example since we paid $5 for the call and $5 for the put, our total debit paid =$10/1000 which represents the maximum amount we can lose from this trade. Max loss is realised if the stock stays right at the strike price of both options at expiration as both options will expire worthless due to the fact that they will carry no intrinsic value being ATM and no extrinsic value left at expiration. 

**Profit** 
 
A trader profits from a long straddle when the stock breakouts of a range that is determined by the total debit they pay. To find this range, add the total debit paid to the call options strike price and subtract the total debit paid to the put options strike price. In this example since the total debit paid =$10, by adding $10 to the 200 call and subtracting $10 from the 200 put, the range that the stock needs to breakout from in-order for a trader to profit is 190-210 at expiration. The further the stock breaks out of this range whether to the upside or to the downside, the greater the profits. To visualise this, take a look at the prices of the options at expiration after the stock had broken out of this range.

**AT EXPIRATION on Feb 16 2021 the stock is trading at 220**

* March 16/21 Long 200 put- $0.00
* March 16/21 Long 200 call- $20.00

The total debit of the straddle is now at $20. This is because as the stock moved to 220, the 200 call had gained $20 of intrinsic value by expiration. Meanwhile, the 200 put is trading for $0 because it has no intrinsic value and no extrinsic value at expiration. Since you bought the call option at $5 and sell it at $20, you make $15. Now Accounting for the put option, since you bought the put option at $5 and is now worthless at expiration, you lose $5. 
 
As you made $15 on the call and lost $5 on the put, your total P/L is = $10/$1000. The greater the stock moves out of the range, the greater the profit.

**Breakeven** 

The 2 breakeven points are at the exact range points of the range. In this example, 190 and 210 are the range points. For example, this is because at 190 at expiration, the 200 put will trade for $10 and the 200 call will trade for $0. As you sell the put for a $5 profit and lose the $5 paid for the long call that expires worthless, you breakeven on the trade.

**Loss (different from max loss)**

At expiration, If the stock trades between the ranges but not at either breakeven points nor the strike prices, (190.01-199.99) &(200.01-209.99), you will lose money on the trade (losses that are smaller than max loss)The further the stock ends up away from the strike price, the lesser the loss.

**Implied Volatility (Vega)**: A rise in Implied Volatility will also be profitable for a Long straddle even if there are no movements in the underlying. This is because this strategy is solely comprised of long options and thus has a positive exposure to vega. 

**Time Decay (Theta)**: The passage of time is inherently a disadvantage for the Long straddle strategy. As this strategy is comprised of solely long options, time decay will be even more rampant than a single leg long option. This is the reason as to why you will need the underlying to move to greater extents so as to offset theta decay

**Exercise and assignment** 

Options are rarely recommended to be be held through expiration. However it is important to understand what happens if they do. Should the underlying trade at the straddles strike price at expiration, both options will expire worthless. If one of the options are ITM and held through expiration, exercise and assignment will take place. Only 1 of the 2 options of this strategy can be ITM at expiration.

USDT is a ""stablecoin"" -- a cryptocurrency whose price is supposed to be pegged to the US dollar -- managed by a company called tether.

Initially tether said they enforced the peg by having each USDT be backed by a USD in a bank account. Then tether ran into all sorts of hilarious hijinks over the years, many of which we only found out because they [were made public in NYAG litigation](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlement_agreement_-_execution_version.b-t_signed-c2_oag_signed.pdf), including:

* Having all of tether's money in their lawyer's personal bank account (May 2017)
* Not having any bank account anywhere in the world for 6 monthsto receive money in. Yet still emitting $400m new tethers in that period. Their lawyer's personal account had, at most, $60m at any point. Bitfinex had two institutional deposits in that whole period, neither of whom purchased USDT.
* Failing to complete an audit and settling on an attestation (An audit verifies where money comes from. An attestation is just an accoutnant saying ""there was money in a bank account on that date"") for ""transparency"". The morning of the attestation, tether moved $380m from sister company bitfinex into a bank account the morning of the day of the attestation.
* Losing $900M to their money launderer, and covering those losses by commingling bitfinex customer funds with tether reserve funds (2018)
* Finding the last bank on earth, [Deltec Bank from Bahamas](https://www.deltecbank.com/) willing to do business with them after Wells Fargo and HSBC fired them as clients. Remember HSBC has the kind of risk tolerance leaving them to [willingly deals with drug cartels](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/hsbc-moved-vast-sums-of-dirty-money-after-paying-record-laundering-fine/). No bank wants tether as a client.

Just read section 2 and 3 of the NYAG settlement. It's a blast. The best recap on the tether saga is by [Amy Castor](https://amycastor.com/2019/01/17/the-curious-case-of-tether-a-complete-timeline-of-events/), but [Patrick McKenzie](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/10/28/tether-and-bitfinex/) also has a good write up. Note that Patrick's piece is quaint now -- it was written back in 2019 when tether's balance sheet was $2B. Tether now has over [$58B on their balance sheet](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.28.53-PM-1024x585.png)

As far as we know, there was no point in history at which USDT in circulation were backed 1-to-1 by USD in a bank account. At this point, they stopped even pretending -- each tether in circulation is backed by... [tether's ""reserves"".](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reserves.gif)

The ""Reserves""

For a long time, tether's ""reserves"" were a mystery. As found in the NYAG investigation, tether likely never had a dollar in a bank account for each USDT, at any point, ever. They're now forced to reveal the makeup in May 2021 as per the NYAG settlement. Tether found a 5-person accounting firm in the Cayman islands willing to do an [attestation](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tether-assurance-feb-2021.pdf), which states they have 0.36% more assets than liabilities.

In anticipation for their forced public disclosure, tether recently posted this [glorious pie chart](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/glorious_pie_chart-1024x769.png)

Which [has](https://protos.com/tether-pie-chart-usdt-dollar-pegged-crypto-stablecoin-dollar-value/) [prompted](https://bennettftomlin.com/2021/05/13/for-every-1-of-tether-there-are-0-03-in-cash/) [many](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tether-first-breakdown-shows-token-120000439.html) [more](https://www.ft.com/content/529eb4e6-796a-4e81-8064-5967bbe3b4d9) [questions](https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2021/05/13/tether-publishes-two-pie-charts-of-its-reserves/). First, we can view the actual debt in this form, as [broken Intel Jackal](https://twitter.com/intel_jakal) ([image](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/piechart.png))

Almost all of the reserves are in some form of loan to a commercial company (corporate bonds, commercial paper, secured loans). Only around 5% are in assets whose value we know (cash, T-Bills).

Inconsistencies

Tether's general counsel, Stuart Hoegner, posted a [highly unusual blog post](https://stuarthoegner.medium.com/tether-is-setting-a-new-standard-for-transparency-and-responding-to-criticism-that-is-fc130e08319b) in which he claims this is good debt by any standard. This raises many inconsistencies, which are easy to see given the magnitude of the numbers at hand.

* Stuart claims they don't hold Treasury Bills because the interest rate is close to 0%. If they hold this risky debt as reserves because it pays higher interest, **why does tether only have 0.36% more assets than liabilities?** Either thether's management is looting the interest rates on the assets and leaving USDT holders with the debt's risk, or we're being lied to.
* With $20B in commercial paper at the time of the attestation, and 50% more USDT on the market since, tether presumably has **$30B in commercial paper** at time of writing. The [entire commercial paper market](https://sec.gov/files/primer-money-market-funds-commercial-paper-market.pdf) in the US is around $1T per year.

We're supposed to believe that **tether somehow holds 3% of the US commercial paper market** at time of writing, and that they *apparently bought 1% of the entire market in the last month alone*.

* The asset allocation strategy in the reserves seems to be [copied from](https://twitter.com/intel_jakal/status/1394562510070583296) an investment fund at tether's bank, Deltec. This investment fund apparently manages $425M, rather than $60B.
* If the reserves are such regular financial assets, how come respectable accounting firms won't even touch it for a simple attestation?

We know that some of the money used for USDT come from Chinese money laundering because a tether shareholder [was recently charged](https://protos.com/china-crypto-otc-king-zhao-dong-criminal-charges-court-docs-show/). But we see no mention of frozen accounts in the reserves. Moreover, this amounts to less than $0.5B, and the perpetrator was nicknamed the ""Chinese OTC King"" -- so even in the charitable case where USDT are fully backed by money laundering, this raises inconsistencies.

Reminder: non-USD reserves for a stablecoin are a problem

As noted by [Frances Coppola](https://www.coppolacomment.com/2021/05/tethers-smoke-and-mirrors.html), it's dangerous to guarantee to clients that something is worth $1 when your assets backing it are not dollars. The value of the USD changes very little. The value of crypto changes a lot.

If you want to enforce a market price of $1 for something backed by not-dollars, then the quantity of reserves needs to go up and down with the asset price changes. Otherwise, you'll eventually become insolvent, when asset prices become lower than what you bought them for.

Who are these loan to?

Tether has lost the privilege of the benefit of doubt a long time ago. Here is how tether's Ponzi scheme likely works:

* All their commercial debt is to the related exchanges (Binance, FTX, Bitfinex - see below) or their affiliated shell companies.
* Tether make new USDT out of thin air and send them against a dollar-denominated loan to these affiliates
* The affiliates use the new USDT to put market buy-orders for crypto, putting them on the new USDT on market
* Crypto goes up in value becaue of the new demand pressure. This overcollateralizes the affiliated loans, justifying more loans.
* Rinse, repeat.

We can track who new USDT go to directly by looking at their [TRON](https://tronscan.org/#/address/TKHuVq1oKVruCGLvqVexFs6dawKv6fQgFs/transfers), [ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5754284f345afc66a98fbb0a0afe71e0f007b949#tokentxns), [OMNI](https://omniexplorer.info/address/1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz) and [Solana](https://explorer.solana.com/address/Q6XprfkF8RQQKoQVG33xT88H7wi8Uk1B1CC7YAs69Gi) blockchain addresses. By matching the blockchain addresses new USDT are sent to to known parties, we can track who are the ones sending [new USDT on the market:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tether-to-exchanges-1024x530.png)

The counterparties are largely Binance, FTX, Bitfinex, and other exchanges. The commercial paper is presumably to affiliated shell companies. I wouldn't put those companies debt at a dollar-to-dollar valuation; for instance [Binance is currently under investigation by the DOJ and IRS](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/binance-probed-by-u-s-as-money-laundering-tax-sleuths-bore-in).

But how does the $1 peg hold?

This is an easy one. [FTX happily admits to enforcing the dollar peg](https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1348773044873949185) ([image](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.12.17-PM-861x1024.png))

You can easily enforce the dollar peg by wash-trading around the $1 price and arbitraging on exchanges who don't.

FTX don't even need to be complicit to the scheme for this to make financial sense: if FTX can get new USDT for $1 on an infinite loan margin from tether, it's perfectly sensible to buy USDT when it's below $1 and shortsell USDT when it's above.

The Mississippi bubble, 2021 style

The cryptocurrency ecosystem is conceptually simple. Money comes in from new investors buying, and the same money comes out to pay those cashing out. It would be a zero-sum ecosystem, except for the fact that miners have to pay their [bills in dollars](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/crypto_is_simple.png)

This is why ""bitcoin investors"" feel an immediate urge to tell everyone else to invest in bitcoin -- if no new money comes in, the financial structure eventually collapses under the miner's sell pressure.

Note how this is different than buying a company's stock. People buy and sell stocks on a stock exchange, but the companies independently have money coming in (from their clients). The stock of a profitable company is a positive-sum ecosystem. If somehow no one wants to buy the stock, a profitable company will be happy to buy it back itself.

When tether comes in with their scheme, they put demand pressure on BTC then add a supply constraint on BTC (also driving up the price!) by reducing the total supply of BTC to [hoard in their reserves](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/crypto_is_usdt.png)

Notice that even though bitcoin prices are higher, **no additional money entered the ecosystem** in the tether pump. Like a Ponzi scheme, we *cannot pay everyone off at the inflated price* using the pool of money that's in the crypto ecosystem (More specifically, the pool of money in the crypto exchange's customer fund bank accounts) When enough money starts looking for the exit door, a $60B hole gets torn into the ecosystem, and [someone has to pay for it.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/masterpiece.gif)

The danger zone happens when BTC drops below $18,500

Assuming that each new USDT is used to instantly buy BTC at market prices (This is a lower bound estimate, since USDT are issued on the market between mint periods, where price is increasing), we can track where the BTC ""price of no return"" is -- where reserve BTC were paid for [more overall than they're now worth.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tether_insolvency_point.png)

We can play around with parameters (they might buy ETH or Dogecoin rather than BTC, etc.) but most calculations land the death zone in the $17k-$20k range -- prices we were at around December 2020.

The scheme can easily collapse above this point. Bernie Madoff's customer deposits was around $18B against a $65B promised liabilities, but his scheme collapsed way before $40B in funds were withdrawn, because fraudsters tend to mismanage and embezzle some of the money for themselves.

Notice that the last point in time where BTC price went significantly below the death zone is the March 2020 COVID price crash -- which is also the point where USDT were started to be minted at a parabolic rate.

The DeFi boom started with the USDT flood

This is a sidenote to this story, but the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) boom started because of USDT flooding the market. DeFi is not a new invention: it's existed since the 2017 bubble. No one picked it up because it's a fairly useless idea: lock up more collateral for a crypto loan than the loan's value and use the loan.

DeFi is exclusively used to leverage trading - eg. lock up BTC, keep the BTC exposure, and use the loan to buy more BTC. You can't buy a house or start a business on a DeFi loan -- the point of normal loans is to use personal creditworthiness and **under**collateralization to move future cashflows into the present. For these reasons, [no one picked it up for years](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.16.05-PM-1024x497.png)

But notice something happened around the same time as USDT exploded. We can track what happened to DeFi by getting historical borrowing rates and matching them to total money in DeFi (TVL), USDT in [DeFi and total USDT](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/defirates-1024x512.png)

A clear story emerges:

No one used DeFi until tether joined the Ethereum blockchain in April 2019. Then a ton of new tethers, with no particular place to go, found themselves emitting DeFi loans. This floored the borrowing rates for DeFi, especially so in April 2020, after tether started printing themselves out of insolvency.

Once borrowing rates were appealing, DeFi started taking off.

Eventually, the DeFi ecosystem tried to distance itself from USDT, but the coin is still around 45% of the entire space.

USDT DeFi loans are generally USDT-denominated. If the USDT peg breaks significantly, these USDT DeFi loans will go into margin call one way or another.

The noose is tightening

At the time of writing, BTC crashed from a high of $64k to around $41k (now 38k). But more importantly, for the first time in months, we're starting to see **significant backflows** into tether addresses, largely from Binance. Here are the outflows and inflows (excluding newly minted USDT) into the tether address [on Tron, for example](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/death-1024x567.png)

The orange lines are USDT coming out onto market. The blue lines are USDT coming back into tether's blockchain address.

This is means people are recently withdrawing, a lot. The music could stop at any moment now. It could take hours, or it could take months.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Not from the copy paste: I want to add to this, on the day of Elon's initial tweet about Tesla not accepting bitcoin, there was a drastic spike of bitcoin coming into exchanges JUST PRIOR to the tweet. Was this Elon, someone he told, or just a lucky trade? Who knows. However, after the tweet there was a sudden move of 650 million tether (so $650m)  onto exchanges to BUY bitcoin as the price was collapsing and this stabilized the price. In my opinion tether is being used to inflate BTC but unlike the federal reserve tether cannot print $$$$. **Oh, and tether clearly states they do NOT guarantee any redemption of dollars to holders of tether.** IE they are not assured you can trade a tether for a dollar like other stable coins

&#x200B;

I would recommend avoiding BTC until tether is fully audited and we know what companies that commercial paper is from.",ng3im3,[],0

Crypto being: $9200
At this point in time planning on holding it on an exchange until I feel comfortable buying in.
______________________________________________________

FIRE (If 50 counts)

This is based ONLY on my ETF's so I will hopefully have a lot of wiggle room to get to this point and stay there or grow before accounting for my stocks, crypto, and 401k.

I used investor.gov compound interest calculator. Assuming I put $27,000 in with monthly contributions of $1500 (should be possible) at an interest rate of 7-9% for 27-32 years, at 50-55 years old I will have ~$2,125,000.

From there, withdrawals of ~8500/month pretax at even 5% will result in more money being made than spent, after 40 years the total being $2,638,000. 

Did I do this correctly and is it realistic? I'd like to think that an average 7% return is reasonable and even conservative. Maybe I'm overthinking it but aside from taxes, is the separation of the ETF's between a RIRA and normal exchange going to make an impact on that $2,000,000?

985,2021-05-10,investing,"Before we get into the juicy details, think for yourself: What are you shooting for? What is your financial goal? How risk-sensitive are you? Answering these questions will help to set you up for eventual success and develop your individual asset allocation strategy accordingly.

Let’s get to the facts: actively trading stocks, and timing market entries and exits come with inherent risks. Missing the best 10 days in the market between 2010 and 2020 would mean an overall decline of 33% (see [*Bank of America chart*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/this-chart-shows-why-investors-should-never-try-to-time-the-stock-market.html) below). Moreover, it is unlikely you sell your assets right before a crash and buy back at the bottom. In most cases, the worst days are followed by the best days which would put you back on square one holding your cash waiting for the crash.

### Strategies to Pick Stocks

Although stock-picking follows a more active approach, long-term investing means being active 1% of the time while leaving your portfolio alone for the other 99%. It is important to keep in mind that less than 10% of all public companies drive 100% of long-term stock-market returns. Therefore your mission is to find the 10% and patiently ride the wave.

Some hands-on advice:

* **Limited diversification**, as you cannot continuously research each company you are invested in on a regular basis. The range of 10-15 stocks is healthy, otherwise, go back to the previous section and consider passive investing.
* **Flexible & innovative companies** can adapt their business model and expand their market potential. The companies with today’s highest market caps all have this trait in common.
* **Don’t ignore what is familiar**, in 1966 Walt Disney was valued at $80 million and they just produced Mary Poppins turning over $30 million alone on that movie. The company was well-known and anyone could have picked up a few shares. $1000 invested back then would average you over $4 million today.
* **Know your strengths** and profit from them. If you are mathematically gifted then focus on the fundamentals. If you work in the industry and know the competitive landscape and product lineup, do that. Find your own style of investing.
* **Google is your friend**, look up the approval rate of the CEO on Glassdoor, read job reviews, check the company’s premises on Google street view and go on the investor relations site of the company. You need to do your own due diligence because nobody physically audits the business you invest in.
* **Leadership and the CEO** are decisive for the long-term success of a company. If the leader of a company is also its founder and owns lots of stock in it, the interests are aligned with the other shareholders and hence money is invested more efficiently.
* **Human** **resource management** such as low employee turnover, revenue per employee, diversity, inclusion, and so forth.
* **Deep dive into the company**: How does it create revenue? What is its market potential? Market growth versus the overall market potential of S&P500? What are the competitive advantages? Cashflow structure? Insider selling? Check on earnings calls, shareholder letters, and sweat the fundamentals a little bit.
* **Impact**: Does this company contribute to a better future?
* **Don’t overpay** because even great companies can be too expensive when too much of their future earnings potential is already priced in. Microsoft’s revenue was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999 and still, the stock had lost 50% of its value in that timeframe.
* **Avoid** owning a stock you can’t explain or you lack conviction in.
* **Double down** on companies that you are convinced are great investments for the long run even if you already own shares. If the business proves viable and returns are increasing, then it is likely to follow that trajectory in the near future.
* **Hold & wait**: trade as little as possible to avoid taxes and to enjoy the runups. The shorter you hold an asset the greater the chance that you have to close the position at a loss. The magic of compound interest will do the rest for you.
* **“Don’t lose money”** – Warren Buffett & treat every dollar as an investment.

I believe that beating the market is possible if you are patient and willing to invest time. After all, the business world is like a car race. In the last quarter of the race, it becomes more evident who might win, and your odds can be calculated with minimized risk exposure. Then you invest in the top-performing racers and still reap much of the benefits.

Keep in mind that most stocks underperform the market. The outsized gains of a few winners are pushing your portfolio higher and make up for any losses on the way.

## Cash

Oh, sweet cash sitting ducks in my account, what am I going to do with you? At current rates of around 1% (if even) it would take 70 years to double my money. By that time it is more likely that I am buried 6 feet underground. I wouldn't even get to experience my slim gains.

Yet there is some upside to holding a percentage of your overall portfolio in cash. Besides, you can’t pay your expenses off by handing out your stocks. Holding some cash is in both active and passive investing approaches detrimental. I advise holding approximately 5-15% of cash as it allows you to:

* Leave your portfolio in peace
* Remain calm during market volatility
* Jump in when prices are low and be opportunistic in the markets

Buying stocks in times of recession has historically brought about outsized gains for investors. It is worth remembering, the more it hurts holding some cash in market booms the more likely you will profit from a swift down-market. The best time to hold cash is when it really hurts to do so. Holding cash allows you to be prepared, and you don’t have to worry about timing the market.
