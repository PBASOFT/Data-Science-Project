209,gzaskm3,2021-05-24,t1_gzapohy,stocks,"Then don't trade with risky, speculative tickers. IRA is meant to be long long term wealth growth and putting in alot on high growth stocks can backfire. Going more towards value stocks or index funds are generally safer for long term, but you want a well-rounded, highly diverse portfolio for retirement. 

Case in point, I have my serious money in managed accounts with risk tolerances adjusted based on my age, cash flow, and potential incomr/earnings of my career. I'm relatively young so I'm still in a ""moderately aggressive"" portfolio with my wealth management firm. That will slowly change to less and less aggressive as I age.

So, imo....unless you do this for a living, then pay the stupid management fee and let the algorithms at the large firms handle your market plays for your long long term accounts. You can just set it in some ETFs and forget it, but even then you can miss the shifting of the sands and be ill positioned for sector plays (which my account will pick up and make plays towards). I pay a management fee, which simply means I get access to their algorithms, an advisor on-call, and they handle all the ""manual work"" of placing trades and rebalancing funds/positions.

That's my suggestion. Unless you are confident you can beat a top-5 bank's algorithm, then go at it yourself. If you want to not have to constantly think about your retirement account(s) positions and if you're doing it right...then just have your wealth management firm manage your serious accounts.

I also have a ""general wealth"" account which is a brokerage account like most, but it's also managed and is much more aggressive than anything in my 401k or ROTH. That is also my serious money, but it's much more in short-term and I could liquidate it at any point (without touching any retirement account) and pay off all debts (mortgage and new car atm). So...it's pretty clear that I fall more in line with the typically ""conservative"" notion that serious money should be managed by a professional (because I have a day job, and 2 kids, and I don't have time to constantly be up at night strategizing). I only play with what is like 5% of my account values in a brokerage account where I have total control. And so far I have realized gain of about 13% (all short-term capital gains) and about 7% of unrealized gain left in. It's just to play with.

But if you're serious about growing wealth and you have a 30-40 year horizon (I.e. retirement ages), then make a managed account, DCA into it for the next 30 years without fault, lay your annual fees, go through bears and bulls. Go through crashes and booms. And when you hit your 50s, have a real talk with your money manager about really tuning the risk to more conservative and safer positions. Depending on how much contributed every month, you'll have lots of zeros behind commas when it's time to push away from equities and more into bonds.",[],0

That said they dont exactly have 100% the same holdings given like cash holdings, then the only diversification is in the cash holdings. Pick one and call it a day. Then id pick a desired portfolio structure for whatever your end goal is. Imagine a 90/10 split. Knowing average returns for SP500 is X and you invest 90% then the remaining 10% could be… i think there are a few stocks that could smash through 10% and would like to capture that. Great! So 90% market 10% speculative. Now you added some risk both upside and downside. Since your average for the market is X and you’re at 90% weight then the 10% speculative will add X+-  x% to your overall returns. 

So whats the point. Stick to a manageable risk profile 80/20 or 90/10 and have at it. Thats a simple strategy. 

You could add another strategy to the portfolio but the majority should stay in the market index. For example you could do 70/20/10. 70 index, 20 dividends, 10 speculative. There might be some overlap, but your reason is sound. Eg i want some quarterly income in cash so i can reinvest elsewhere.

Business is conservative with their Guidance as always, hence the selloff after the last ER call.  BUT they are guiding **105% growth** next quarter

*"".. ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other factors. Our current expectation is that Q2 revenue will grow around 105% year over year. ""*

*""...In Q2, we expect global MAUs to grow in the mid-teens and US MAUs to be around flat on a year-over-year percentage basis.""*

Total revenue was **up 78% y/y to $485M**, steady growth. MAU was 478M, less than 480M expected but it was **up 30% y/y** . This was another reason of selloff, which I think is way more exaggerated. 

Pinterest is intentionally slowing the ads shown in order to grow the users. There is a price to pay if you monetize the users too early before the network effect is fully realized. This is the sole reason why Pinterest has low ARPU compared to Snapchat. Pinterest has almost double the active users but the market cap is less than half. It's growing faster than Snapchat. They can double from here just by monetizing their current users. 

They have not realized their e-commerce potential yet, it has not even started, I think they have just dipped their toe to see how it goes. It will be huge even if their user growth stalls  or even shrinks from current level. They have partnered with Shopify and it has been successful so far. Also as of today they have partnered with IKEA. 

Users go to the Pinterest with the intention of shopping and they don't mind the ads. It's the only platform where the ads actually complements what you are looking for. From my own experience I like how I get different full bedroom setups ads with an option to buy. 

CEO and founder Ben Silbermann owns around 6% (I think, don't quote me on this) of the shares. I like how founder has heavy skin on the game.  Also I like how the management is executing on the roadmap year after year.

Here is what I'll like to see going forward:  I want to see them go full force on the better social media strategy with inspirations and e-commerce. I like them to partner with more companies like Shopify, IKEA, etc. and also keep on working on the native e-commerce experience. Focus on the growth of e-commerce aspect while slowing down the ads aspect though it's incredibly tough at this moment.

If you are wanting to open up a brand new account from scratch (like, without any account that already exists with the firm), then you'll typically need to do the manual work to liquidate your positions and transfer the cash into the new account.

Best to just open a managed account and see what they do with it. And call your advisor if you want to learn more. They are there to talk to you about your money, so use them. They don't do much of the actual ""thinking"" anymore since it's all ran by computers, but they know general market trends, history, and strategy. You can pick their brains while directly discussing your money. Then open up a brokerage account. Throw in what you can afford to lose, and play a bit. You'll win and lose some. No worries.

Maybe they are, maybe they’re not, maybe they should change. But you don’t have to day trade to make money anyway.

What I do think should change is the rules used to flag pattern day trading. Like same day buying/selling of a dozen or so different shares once in that same week does not make you a day trader IMO - it’s about frequency not volume. If you do that multiple days that week then sure. But maybe you are fine tuning your trades that day and plan on leaving it be for months afterward. Markets change and fluctuate so while you’re entering into a new position it would be nice to be able to have that flexibility.

Rule should be no more than one day a week, or maybe a month, for high volume day trading activity - OR no more than 4 days with a day trade. But then I guess I could see people easily abusing this system so idk.",[],0

A couple of things come to mind:
1. You are ahead of most people if you’ve been keeping track of all the dividend reinvestment, splits and any spin offs (which can be non taxable and have a basis allocation between the 2 or be taxable).
2. Anything you inherited should have an acquisition date that matches the decedent’s date of death and a FMV as of that date (there are some flourishes and alternates to this, but this is the case 99.9% of the time). These should all be considered long term as well, even if they were acquired the day before the date of death. If these equities were acquired on or before 12/31/10, they would be uncovered (which means when you sell them, the broker must report the term and proceeds to you and the IRS but they do not have to supply the cost basis info, original acquisition date,etc). Any equity acquired on or after 01/01/2011 is covered and the broker would have to report all of those data points to you and the IRS.
I mentioned the covered dates because with inherited positions, you can roll the tax lots up but you’d do it in one group of uncovered and one group of covered.
If it was all stocks (or equities as we call them) you inherited, the above is true. If you have any mutual funds, options or bonds, it’s the same just a hair different on the dates for the covered status (the IRS rolled out what securities became covered between 2011 and 2016).
Computer share is a MFer to work with but I’m surprised Schwab wasn’t willing to help you out on those. I’m not involved with that process but I’m fairly positive if you’ve got the certificates, you might have to sign a couple of docs or provide some documentation to get those converted at my Firm.

If bonds weren't as overpriced as they are, the remainder would constitute those plus some cash. But with rate hikes on the horizon, it's like a game of chicken: Will the hot market tank and take rates with it, making bonds not such a bad idea? Or will rates rise before then, making them a bad hedge? Do the rising rates trigger a selloff? Is it better to go mostly cash and assume eating inflation will pay off in due course through new, less dangerous opportunities to invest?

My rationale is that the markets--stocks, bonds, etc.--are too high temperature to play aggressively unless you know how to safely navigate the waters. The markets are also more leveraged than they have ever been, which means the downside exposure is relatively extreme if the shit hits the fan. I know for a fact that I don't have the experience to invest aggressively right now, so I'm mostly sitting on cash. People say thst risk doesn't factor into the equation at a young age and so any drastic downturns are ultimately transient, but holding cash that deteriorates slowly over time in hopes of a better opportunity in the next 1-2 years is also transient in the long run and far less painful.

I was super excited to be up $30 last week, but I'm down $100 now.

You really need to question your investing when you trade based on hope.  You are HOPING there’s a huge conspiracy and everyone is hiding numbers, and HOPING a squeeze will happen again, and HOPING short interest is higher than reported.  

How long have you been trading?  I’ve been trading Daily for a living now for 2 years and trades through the whole COVID crash.

You on the other hand FOMO’d into a stock that had already shot up several 100% - and appear to be convinced you should chase it even More.

My question for you is, does the company have a viable plan for the future yet?  No.  they don’t.  If they do please link me.

And second question - if Robinhood and citadel changes the rules during the first squeeze, what makes you think they will not do that again, and or why can’t they just permanently bend the rules here if they are actually screwed in some way due to falsely reported numbers?  

I mean they already control the media and the numbers right?  I guess they’ll just let it go to 10 million, many times more than the entire worlds GDP, 

and we will all live a doomsday market crash (except for you and your digital, fungible shares that you don’t even own will somehow be able to be cashed out?  Lol)
