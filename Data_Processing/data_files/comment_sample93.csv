Plastic=oil=refinery=gas=jetfuel=generators, the most efficent way to create substainable energy!
Them renewables, solar, and wind, and hydroelectric, sure renewable source, solar is 50/50. Hince factor of 2, daytime & nighttime. PowerCell & PowerPacks only store so mucb energy then it has to recharge, another factor, gas products smelt the metals used to make them nigty high tech componets. 
Chips too! It takes more heat than what electricity can or could ever produce to smelt metals! 
Heavy metals and Industry Metals & precious metals. 

Point is, we all need Oil & Gas, and we have GREEN SEA ALGEA! MY EXXONMOBILE GREEN SEA ALGEA BLOOMING FARMS. 
THE GREEN SEA ALGEA, IT EATS Co2 up, and produces Oxygen from Co2! Carbon Nutralized! 
Oh and we can produce Oil, its a clean renewable resource! It produces more oxygen than our factories produce Co2 and green house gasses. 
So the fact is oil is Green Sea Algea, ancient, same form as todays green sea algea! 
Microbiology Professional Scientist! 
I may know more than biden and his fake liars that are uneducated in science, real science. Chemistry. Oil based chemistry stuff our Renewable Resources tech, are made from oil, that plastic covering wires, silicone chips, and metals & precious metals. 
This is real science, facts vrs fictional science.of dnc. Aka bad science and based on no physical facts and proof of concepts would work the way they think it is the main goal. Infact, its my Nuclear Technologies Labatories, is the real energy efficent always on, and renewable and most efficent beyound solar or other chemistry based power generators.
In the early 1990s, i developed a BAD ASS, WICKED CLEAN, NUCLEAR GENERATOR ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SUITCASE. PROTON LASER FUSSION NUCLEAR GENERATOR. REAL ADVANCED, REAL POWERFUL ENERGY PRODUCING GENERATOR! 48MEGA KILO-WATS OF POWER! 
Super DeepCell Power Pack absorbed the energy. It littlerly filled the powercell in 5mins. That a normal old 1950s steam nucleat generator(fukashima version), basicly, that well, its productive energy output is alot less per hour. 
But see, my new Generator dont use steam to produce energy. It uses Pure Fussion absorbtion of particals. And absorbing protons from the burn rate of the nuclear fuel by hot hot PROTON LASERS! 
Oh and its Radiation issues, them lasers, cut the rad half life to 0% of decay in billions of years, to secounds fast. 5mins=30min cool down. Radiation zips down to 0!
Like normal rad background levels like nothing was nuclear in it! 
Science of NUCLEAR ENERGY advanced and economicly affordable! Cheapest form of energy and creates enough Mwh and easy to maintain and it wont go subMuclear Metldown! Its clean and very safe manageble and the most super safest nuclear design ever! 
All them stockpiled nuclear waste of uranium.and plutonium, well, it can eat the 70-80% fuel rods up. And yet, the amount of it lasting more longer for fuel source. Is astronomical longer and more efficent on it takes less nuclear fuel source than previous designs ever, like 1000th less than & produces 10,000% more energy! 
Oil is used to make alot of energy renewable sources, but, the more efficent renewables is alot greater and cleaner than ever before! And greater! Cost afforability and easy to mass produce! 
But without our oil, thats renewable (Green Sea Algea), that produces oxygen, and oil when it dies and decays(1week to 2 weeks), and big bloom farms, we can produce billions of barrels a week or every 2 weeks, and enough to last more over that. So we can physicaly renew a resource and produce more products from it. Plastic, parts  and materials and chemistry chemicals. 
Its tied up into all renewables. Practices and fuction and uses. Developing solar, my big oil is involved 100%. Shale, crude, brent, each are apart of it. And wencan renew it! New oil, constantlu for like ever ever ofnl forever.",[],0

He has a bachelor's degree in physics. That's a solid achievement but it doesn't put you in the same league as those with a doctorate or more under their belt.

> and in SpaceX interviews where people actually asked him meaningful questions he could explain most anything into detail.

Maybe, I haven't seen most of those. However for the things I have seen he sounds like someone parrotting a discussion he overheard. It never has any depth or substance to it.

> Did he actually give lectures that we can see online? Would be interesting to see. I mean I doubt anyone with only a BSc is qualified to be a lecturer but neither do most guest profs ever present anything in depth in my experience. It's always more a TED talk of some kind.

What I mean by a lecture at a university is just as a guest speaker, not as a lecturing professor.

I've not followed Musk for years but I *think* these are two videos I watched:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1HZIQliuoA

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVk1hb0ZOrE

> Also quantum mathematics is a thing, afaik.

It's not a thing. At least it's not a thing in the common venacular of research physicists or mathematicians. Mathematics is just mathematics, there's no special 'quantum mathematics'.

I'm sure someone has used the term somewhere online, but it's not a phrase you'll ever hear in real life.

-------

But anyway I'm not really interested in the Musk-o-sphere, but I'm occasionally asked what my opinion of him\his ventures are (because I'm a research physicist).

* Tesla: Cool but overvalued - TSD will take a lot longer to arrive than expected. They have good BMS IP

* SpaceX: Skeptical of their cost savings. Books are closed and they have a huge appetite for VC money. I reckon they're launching at a massive loss and don't think it'll be as revolutionary as they pitch. Might become another big gear in the military industrial complex though.

* NeuraLink: Just no. Exists for hype.

* Boring Company: Just no. Exists for hype.

* SolarCity: Don't know much about but it's super suss how Tesla acquired them when they had liquidity issues, and didn't tell shareholders.

Overall I'm happy with sticking to sectors I understand better and that don't need hype to sustain their market price. ASML is a major one in the portfolio for example.",['TSLA'],1

The mind and inspiration do not perform like a light switch. If you take inspired, inventive people and constantly force them to perform mediocre tasks to meet mediocre objectives; with sufficient time, you end up with mediocre people. Once you let casual indifference replace intellectual integrity, and complacency take place of inquisitive vigor, deliberate indifference first becomes a habit, and then an ingrained character. Without proper cultivation, talent, and motivation erode quickly and once ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù becomes a collective culture, it is pretty much irreversible. Soon you won't have any potential to tap, just an army of sterile minds only interested in scavenging the next paycheck at the end of the month.

I don't mean disrespect, but it feels like that's exactly what you're doing.  You could've drawn that flag with any of those candles and you chose the two that produced a breakout today.

Ignore the May data, pretend we're still in April, and draw the lines again.  We get a flag that should've had a big breakout already, except it didn't, because breakout flags don't matter on a heavily manipulated stock.

I don't know what that red line represents but it starts on a candle that is the result of an illegal trading halt.  That's not good data for TA.

3704,gyj0pjh,2021-05-18,t3_nemlpe,wallstreetbets,"I agree.  The current issue is a supply side one, not a monetary one.  
Are most people thinking 'I must build my deck now becasue next year lumber will be twice the price again'  or 'I'll wait and do it next year'.  


Obviously some are/have been thinking 'I have time now, I will pay the prices and do it now', but that is transitory.  


My point is that inflation occurs when the masses buy everything they can now becasue they know they will pay more in the future.  That is not happening.  In fact back deposits have been increasing significantly.  That is not inflationary.  


People saying the Fed is just printing money are being misleading at best and really just downright wrong at worst.  In addition, the government spending borrowed money has never been more than transitory as far as inflation is concerned becasue in the end the debt load is disinflationary.  


I hear youtubers say something like 25% of all dollars printed have been printed in the last year.  Well, they are very much misusing the word 'printed'.  Those dollars are not in circulation, they are tied up in the banking system.  How do they get released?  Buy people and companies borrowing money (one main point of QE - to try to keep interest rates low and give banks reserve assets to lend against to encourage borrowing).  


So does everyone want to go out and finance a car at 2% right now becasue next year the rate will be 4% or higher (i don't know what the current rates are, just as an example)?  I don't think so.  Are companies loading up more debt now becasue it will be more expensive next year?  Doesn't seem like it.  In fact the reverse is happening, credit is contracting, or at least not expanding at the rate it needs to.  


The only thing about inflation is that it is such a big deal, that it does present a serious concern.   


Burry is obviously long inflation.  But he is also short TSLA.  Now I've never bought into TSLA myself (clearly I was wrong), but I have watched people and funds try to short it since 2013 and it has never ended well.  It does look like it could drop here - but it has done this many, many times in the last 10 years.  One ballsy trade and some luck does not mean you are going to always be right.

GME is even UNDERVALUED where it is right now, typically retail trades at above 4x annual sales that would put it at 300+++ the only reason its down here is cause shorts and media FUD. thats gonna change, so if magically all the shorts disappeared wed still 2-3x our money probably even more.  
amc people are frustrating and sort of hated round these parts because you're too fucking stupid OR lazy to see this even though theres infinite amount of DD that you can read  
Have you even seen the AMA's these gme motherfuckers throw ? professionals in their field giving us hours of their time to discuss not just gme but the market / corruption as a whole. THERES A QUANT THAT USED TO WORK FOR CITADEL THAT JUST BOUGHT GME SHARES AFTER AN AMA. ( i think he worked for citadel, i saw him in a god damn documentary )  
If I had a child and he/she bought amc over gme given the DD available, I would consider myself a failure of a parent  
the ONLY way i think buying amc is acceptable is if YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOR A GME  
but hey, i'm a fucking retard",['GME'],0

>Good luck to you, however as a civil engineer I can tell you we don't use concrete to repair bridges and roads.

I'm going to have to disagree with this statement too. Concrete roads (which do exist, not all roads are asphalt) will need to be repaired with concrete. Many bridges are also constructed out of concrete (i.e. for the decks, piers, etc). Many bridges at the very least need repair to spalling concrete to mitigate potential issues from exposed rebar.

>*This includes funding to improve air quality, limit greenhouse gas emissions...*  
  
Concrete is a huge producer of carbon dioxide emissions during manufacturing so that would be pretty ironic...

Your statement about CO2 emissions isn't wrong. However, Cemex has historically received funds from the United States for sustainability goals. So that quote on funding for greenhouse gas emissions research makes me even more bullish on Cemex.

Anyway, I don't know how things work, it just seems like I made a few mistakes and I can learn from them, but no one should be telling me to not trade.  It's something I'm very passionate about.  There seems to be a ceiling on GME around 200 right now, I don't know why, no one wants to hold the bag that high?  Any way, if you sell around 185 to 200, you'll be alright, after that, who knows what will happen with GME.

In order to travel faster than light you pretty much have to master the whole matter to energy conversion thing.    You're not just moving a whole fuck ton of flammable stuff and lighting a match anymore.

Anyways.   Once you've got that done... you must have figured out a lot of other cool tech stuff.

So what are we good for?

Forced labor?    No way.    1 doing what?   2 they got robots.  3.  We kinda suck.   Were fragile and complain a lot.

Resources... nope.   Matter to energy... they don't need gold or oil.   They flew here.   They got resources pretty much figured out.

Food?   Nope.   The food we eat doesn't make us healthy... I doubt they would wanna eat us.


Whats the one thing every body who gets abducted says?    Butt stuff. Or maybe they call it probing to keep some dignity,  but we all know it's butt stuff.  That's all we're good for.   Picture some hill billies sticking a fire cracker in a frogs butt.   Now make that hill Billy shorter.. with big eyes and grey.     Lose the pick up truck and add a space ships. We are the frogs..

Now it becomes 1300 after adding healthcare/vision/dental. And afterwards, it becomes 1100 after he matches his employers 401k. So in total, let's just say he makes 4400 a month.

Since he's probably 31 or something, let's assume he doesn't live with his parents, let's just say he lives in a cheap run down studio apartment for about 1400 a month. Then we got food - 400, gas - 160, electric - 130, internet - 50, cell phone - 50, insurance - 120. We also need to include miscellaneous stuff that he will need such as toilet paper, soap, beer, and etc - 200. This leaves with him with 1890 a month.

So in 1 year, he can save 22,680. His student loan is 400k, he will not save anything. He's not living. He's surviving. This man will probably be 50 years old before he finally pays off his student loan. He only knows the frugal way to live.

Now let's assume he lives with his parents instead. The only difference will be, all the money he is saving will be for a down payment for a house. That's all. He will then have a mortgage and a giant student loan. I weep for his situation.",[],0

A put is an option (financial product) associated with a stock (TSLA in this case) where the value goes up if the associated stock goes down.

This is because the put gives you the right to sell the stock at the agreed strike price (specified at put purchase time). So if you buy a put at the current stock price, and the stock price goes down, you have the right to sell the stock at a higher price than current market value, giving the put its value.

I strongly suggest you stop investing. You seriously have a problem and you don't seem to want to stop. It's not healthy to gamble your student loans to try and be that 1 in 1,000 success story. 

Get your ass back in school and study for the sake of your family. You said you care about your family then start acting like it and study so you can at least pay the minimum on those loans and provide even a little bit for your family. 

Not going back? Get yourself in a trade school. Faster and make decent amount of money.

Not interested in going back to school, a trade, or stopping yourself from investing money that technically is not even yours? Then distance yourself from your family. If you can't help them by helping yourself then you need to distance yourself from them until you can get some professional help. 

Make sure your family has someplace to stay where they can be okay for the time being and fix yourself for their sake.",[],1

Moreover this is far from the first time the stock market has seen a bubble. By this logic we had hyperinflation in the '01(With a normal 2.8% inflation rate) tech bubble and the '08 housing bubble(3.8%). Both markets crashed from their highs and we did not see the price of commodities go up with their insanity then either.

Housing is particularly scary as it's simply prices being bid up at auction by an increased supply of buyers due to low mortgage rates and down payments required being as low as 5%. This is unlikely to persist much past COVID and people paying 30% over ask for homes right now have a high likelihood of being fucked once things go back to normal. It'll be short of a housing crisis most likely as there's no evidence that bad loans are being shit out but there's very little chance that the volatile gains we've seen this year are going to be maintained IMO.

In short, believe the 4% inflation numbers. There's no reason to disbelieve them. You are not paying 30% increased prices on commodities like rice, milk, water, or meats which have remained pretty stable over the last year(Outside of again situations like the housing market where temporary external sources like meat shortages temporarily jack up prices), and housing is unlikely to stay as insane as it is.",[],0

GME is trading at $180 right now.  Fair value is probably in a range of $40 - $200 given the publicly available information. The strategic new hires, retirement of all debt and recent raising of $500M in capital lean it towards the top end of that estimate for me. This info is all fairly new.  Some investors are buying with the expectation that new information will be released that will show a higher value for the stock like eSports, Build a Gaming PC etc.  Some may be over estimating the impact, others are under estimating.  

Pricing on securities is very dynamic and is impacted not just by the info around a stock but also large macro events and alternative suitable investments. I think Burry under estimated the price of GME and is likely over estimating how far Tsla will drop.  My guess is it will find a bottom and then proceed to rip upward and trim his unrealized profits pretty quickly.
