28,2021-05-20,StockMarket,"I really don't understand this shit.

All the time now, a company performs well and the stock price drops because of it. Take Lowe's last week for example. It literally doubled earnings, 8x in a row it's destroyed them, and It's down 9% since. What more could you literally want from a company (I dont own it btw, so this isn't a rant on that basis)

I know the argument is ""ThE WhoLE MaRkEt Is DoWn"". Sorry, no, I don't buy this bullshit.

Let's look at todays winners;

America Great Health is the 5th biggest gainer today, up 15%. It's a garbage fucking pennystock that trades at 0.18 cents. Even worse, it's a bullshit pharma stock that used to be a fucking marketing company. Normal volume is 10 million. Volume today - 200 million. There is no news to justify this interest

Iovance Biotherapeutics, another fucking pharma stock, missed earnings, has CLAIMS OF SECURITIES FRAUD,  and is up 15% today.

LifeMD has had 2 lawsuits filed against it in the last week, about claims its directors have committed (even more) fraud -- seems like a pattern. Even better;

**LifeMD appears to use unlicensed doctors to dispense OTC medications, has implemented an autoshipping/autobilling scheme, failed to honor guarantees, and put in place abusive telemarketing practices.**

So what does the stock do in response to this? Of course, it jumps 15%.

To end my rant, the 3rd placed highest today is another bullshit company, a Chinese medical company called Lianluo Smart. There's one single news article linking it to a takeover by newegg or something, the news article made little sense. Low and behold, normal volume is 400k, today it's 9 million. Even if the news is to be believed, this one single article was posted 1 hour ago, yet the price suddenly spiked 2 hours ago.

So, why do companies that do well, make money, smash earnings lose their stock value, and bullshit, nonsense companies get P&D so much. This is a daily occurence. Every single day I see a new company increasing its share price by 50%+ and it's nonsense. I thought P&D's were illegal.

I'm losing (lost tbh) all faith in the market and it feels more and more like a (rigged) casino every day now.",nhf2c1,[],0
416,2021-05-18,StockMarket,"Hi all! I hope this is posted in the correct sub. 

I‚Äôm currently enrolled in a MBA and I‚Äôm looking for some advice on an assignment in my microeconomics module. Essentially I‚Äôve been asked to give my analysis and hypothesis of an excel spreadsheet that contains customer deposits for a brokerage firm. This spreadsheet contains two columns (sum and net deposits) that I am to base my calculations on.

I‚Äôm attempting to calculate assets under management (image 1). The professor has provided the formula for this however I‚Äôm unsure how to calculate market movements. I know the definition for market movements varies between subject and company so I‚Äôm unsure of how to approach this.

Can anyone tell me how to calculate market movements based off the columns in image 2? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated üôè

485,2021-05-21,StockMarket,"I am a new investor and while I am learning more every day and looking into stuff more and more, Coca Cola has caught my eye. Basically, coca cola (I'll just say KO for now on) was shown to have a div/yield of around 3. On top of that, KO isn't going anywhere any time soon, and even though it's a gigantic thing, it's only at around 54 dollars per share. I'm thinking of buying a bit more shares of this than I normally would, around 19-20 or so, so I can get a decent amount of dividends and put those back into investing. I have tried to play it as intelligently as I could, and while something may seem dumb, to me it made logical sense. I've mostly been investing in ETF's, with only Visa being my one blue collar company. I was wondering if it would be wise to then buy a few of KO as my next blue collar company, and buy more for the dividends aspect too.  


My comparison, my portfolio right now is:  
2.51 shares of VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)  
3.02 shares of V (Visa)  
1.05 Shares of SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF)  
2.53 shares of VTV (Vanguard Value ETF)  
(I plan on buying a few shares of KO but here's where I come to ask if it's worth it to buy more, around 19-20 or just buy a few like I did with the others)  


Thanks for the help and if you read this far, thanks for reading this far too.",nhov3b,[],0

965,2021-05-21,StockMarket," 2 types of passive crypto mining I've found you can use on your phone

I've been looking at ways to generate passive crypto long term without a rig and stumbled on 2 ways you can mine crypto from your phone without consuming data or battery power. Both apps are on Google play and Iphone store.

One is an app called Kinfit. It tracks your steps and rewards you in crypto, It syncs to your phones 'fitness app' and is honestly kind of fun and motivating. Not much, but its passive and I'm sure it adds up if the app is downloaded for a year or so. I walk alot for work, so I figured why not?

The second is called Pi Network. This one is cool since its still in early release and invite only. All you have to do is check the app once a day to prove you're not a bot. This one is even more passive since you dont even have to walk to earn. The staff in the app is always very active as well to answer questions .If you're interested in the Pi network, my invitation code is: Slacklink. (It has 255k 4.5 star reviews on google play store)

Cheers! Happy mining!",nhx7f0,[],1
