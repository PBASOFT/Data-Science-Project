42,2021-05-25,StockMarket,"Amazon's latest movement is an acquisition of MGM holdings for $9 billion. That would be the biggest acquisition since Whole Foods. We believe it would be the key growth catalysis for its Amazon Prime subscription and possibly impact deeply into its advertisement business.

**What is Metro Goldwyn Mayer, Inc. - MGM**

https://preview.redd.it/bbpcu3nvu9171.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70a005edee2d9e4202999eac2a53c89eb66ca8db

If you don't recall what MGM is, the photo above should ring some bells by now. MGM is one of Hollywood's most famous movie producers, with its lion logo at the beginning of every movie that they made. It includes James Bond, Rocky, recently Tomb Raider, and A Star is Born.

&#x200B;

For most people, that means if the e-commerce giant successfully acquires MGM, all those movies will be on Amazon Prime Video on demand. It is good for all those prime users, including myself.

**What Does It Mean To An Investor**

https://preview.redd.it/cjegnzmzu9171.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e5ff2bdd7a6915615c340b50545f72cdaea5bff

Amazon already has Prime Video, why they still need to buy another one you might ask. It buys talented movie makers instead of buying a company. However, this pandemic gave both Amazon and MGM a second thought. For MGM, they are unable to release movies in theaters. In fact, they have already sold some of their movies to streaming services. The pandemic hit the movie industry very badly. On the other hand, Amazon has a hard time making some successful movie in-house. If you don’t believe it, can you name one movie that it has made? Still, they are one of the biggest streaming service providers.

**Amazon Prime**

https://preview.redd.it/9m1581i3v9171.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=837149ff148ec751bf413bda5d03fa8fb3149a74

In 2021, there are around 150 million Amazon Prime users in the US, and most of the people join the membership because it offers free one-day shipping locally. This is followed by the second is for the Amazon Prime Video. It's total revenue for the quarter ending 31 March 2021 was almost $110 billion, over 40% increased year over year. If all 150 million Prime members stayed for one year, it contributed over 17 billion. That would be 15% of the company's total revenue. If more than half of the people join Prime because of its streaming service, we believe the acquisition of MGM would boost the Prime subscription number to a new high.

The $9 billion seems too much for acquiring a company studio. However, if you compared the $11 billion spent on video and music content in 2019; the cost of the first season Lord of the Rings series ($465 million), the acquisition now would be considered as a very good deal for Amazon.

**The Advertisement Network**

Compared with Facebook or Google, the Amazon advertisement network is still very small. However, the potential is hard to ignore. Amazon's advertisement business is generating nearly $7 billion in just a quarter and it keeps growing, it is nearly 80% growth from last year. MGM not only put movies into the theater, but it also has a global-based TV network. The acquisition of MGM would give amazon the tool to test out their advertising serving or targeting capabilities and reach more potential Amazon Prime users worldwide.

**Amazon Web Services - AWS**

For most people, Amazon is just an e-commerce company. However, every investor should know, it is much more than that. Amazon Web Services, also known as AWS, is the biggest cloud service provider worldwide. In fact, this website is being hosted on AWS. AWS delivered over $13 billion in revenue, contributing over 12% of the total revenue. Amazon Prime Video is steaming from AWS which means it can also help Amazon to lower the taxable income by deducting the cost of using AWS services. However, we believe the cloud services growth rate would be slower, yet AWS would remain the dominant company of cloud computing services.

**Overweight**

Amazon is gaining more share in e-commerce due to the pandemic. The cloud services would be the new cash cow, money-making machine, and the Prime Video is believed to drive the Prime subscription number to a new high.",nkqbtm,[],0

The cost of the trade is 46.00. Is that the most I will lose on this trade? This is for Jun 18th. If it is in the money on the 17th or before do I just sell them? Not sure how this works. It looks like it will buy the two at 10 and sell 20 so it is even on the 18th and i don't have to do anything and it will sell in the money on the 18th if it is in the money? Is it really that easy to do this kind of trade? Just put it in and let it go? Either it is out of the money and expires or it is in the money and it will automatically sell?,nm9z5d,[],0

Lloyd’s Bank (American ADR - LYG) released the following statement in their 2021 Shareholder Event call last week regarding the opportunity to pay an additional dividend in 2021 beyond the maximum allowable set by the UK government in response to the Covid crisis. 

“Regarding our dividend. Last year, following a request to all banks by the Prudential Regulation Authority, the Group suspended dividends on ordinary shares and cancelled the final dividend for 2019. These decisions were not taken lightly and I'm sure will have come as a disappointment to you, our shareholders.

However, our capital position has remained strong as a result and, following the PRA announcement in December, the Board was therefore able to recommend a total ordinary dividend of 0.57 pence per share - the maximum allowable within the PRA guidelines.

We recognise the importance of the dividend to many of our shareholders. The PRA has said that they will consider their guidance on 2021 dividends before banks announce their half-year results, so the Board expects to be in a position to discuss interim dividends when it reviews the performance of the business for the first half of the year. Our position on quarterly dividends will also be confirmed at this time.

The Board remains committed to future capital returns. In 2021, subject to regulatory guidance, the Board intends to grow the dividend from 2020, in line with the Group's progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy.”

https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/LON:LLOY/Lloyds-Banking-Group/rns/975557

The Prudential Regulation Authority will release an update to their guidance requiring UK banks to scrap dividends throughout 2020 and 4Q 2019 sometime this summer. Currently a maximum allowable dividend of 0.47p is set for 2021. However the PRA is expected to either increase this amount or allow banks to reinstate unrestricted dividends. Although unrestricted dividends will most likely occur in 2022, the opportunity for additional dividends in 2021 and a large increase in yield beginning in 2022 could be a catalyst for LYG to cross the $3 threshold and touch $4 around the time the updated guidance and dividend plan is released. 

Additional info from Q1 2021:

Lloyd’s CET1 ratio is 16.4% before dividends and 16.2% after, well ahead of the bank’s target of around 12.5% and regulatory requirements around 11%.

Lloyd’s released approximately $460M from their impairment reserve that was created in response to the Covid crisis. $3,740M remains in the reserve. 

Lloyd’s UK banking peers (Barclays, HSBC, NatWest) are in similar positions.",nmbega,[],0

Since Visa and Mastercard started to support cryptocurrencies, it created a surge in M&A activity in the on-ramp space.

Perhaps, the most active company has been TechX Technologies Inc., a publicly traded company listed on the  Canadian Securities Exchange. TechX acquired fiat-to-crypto gateway Xport Digital for C$5 million on May 3rd.  On May 24th, the Company just announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Mobilum, a fintech company with fiat-to-crypto payment processing technology and a digital wallet, for C$16 million.

At present, Mobilum’s daily processing volume ranges from C$100,000 to C$250,000 in transactions for cryptocurrency exchanges that include [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/assets/payments?lang=en_US), the sixth largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Supporting over 200 cryptocurrencies and 80+ fiat currencies,  Mobilum’s payment gateway services are accessible to over 8 million global users. 

Going forward, with bitcoin and crypto now turning the heads of financial institutions and banks, it’s likely that 2021 (and beyond) will bring a greater number of ‘traditional’ finance companies buying up firms within crypto. Furthermore, we are likely to see an increase in crypto firms acquiring companies outside of the sector. 

“*TechX is very excited about acquiring Mobilum’s innovative technology, which is creating a bridge between fiat and crypto space to speed up cryptocurrency mass adoption worldwide*,” said TechX CEO Peter Green. 

No long or short term debt on the books. YTD from 0.11 to current 0.82. Reached a 52-week high of 1.68, recent dip is due to crypto scare all over the entire industry. It will recover for sure and TechX will be prepared to move higher with all the new releases and acquisitions.

2021-04-27 00:51 ET - News Release

Mr. Graydon Kowal reports

GUARDIAN ANNOUNCES MOUNT CAMERON, YUKON WORK PROGRAM

Guardian Exploration Inc. has contracted Aurora Geosciences, based in Whitehorse, Yukon territory, to perform a helicopter-supported field program at its 100-per-cent-owned Mount Cameron property, located in the Mayo mining district, Yukon territory, Canada.

Mineralization at Mount Cameron consists of structurally controlled polymetallic veining and manto-style carbonate replacement mineralization (CRDs) enriched in silver-lead-zinc (Ag-Pb-Zn). Mount Cameron is similar to other nearby polymetallic Ag-Pb-Zn deposits within the Keno Hill silver district.

Historic drilling previously performed at Mount Cameron in 1974 returned values of up to 6.1 metres of 287.3 grams per tonne silver, 26.5 per cent zinc and 5.78 per cent lead.",nmfetx,[],1
574,2021-05-27,StockMarket,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 27, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) rising while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly as market participants looked toward the new weekly jobless report. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered in recent weeks, with the SPY roughly 3 points away from its record level. 

This week, the indexes have largely consolidated, an encouraging sign following the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May. Market participants continue to look towards incoming economic data to further judge whether inflation will lead to a sustained jump in prices, causing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, or be a transitory side-effect as the US economy roars back following the coronavirus-induced recession. Personally, I am in the latter camp and am not concerned about sustained inflation. 

Todd Jablonski, chief investment officer at Principal Global Asset Allocation said, “Inflation has gone from being on no one’s radar screen maybe five years as a lead concern, to now being at the absolute forefront as you see the economy rebound off of COVID lows. There has been a tremendous acceleration in earnings, coupled with massive monetary and fiscal stimulus.”

members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

The Department of Labor’s Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week to yet another pandemic-era low, an encouraging sign that the labor market is improving following the extremely disappointing April Jobs report, which showed 266,000 new jobs added in the month, far below estimated of more than 1 million and a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March. 

* **Initial jobless claims, week ended May 22:** 406,000 vs. 425,000 expected and 444,000 the week prior
* **Continuing claims, week ended May 15:** 3.642 million vs. 3.680 million expected and a revised 3.738 the week prior

**Highlights** 

* Boeing (BA) agreed to pay at least $17 million to settle enforcement cases with the Federal Aviation Administration over production issues with its 737 jets. Stock reacted positively to the news. 
* Durable goods orders, or orders for manufactured goods intended to last at least three years, unexpectedly declined in April, ending an 11-month streak of increases, the Commerce Department said Thursday, an encouraging sign. 
* “Meme stocks” are on the move again, with AMC gapping up 40% on the day. Gamestop (GME) and AMC have both been on monster runs this week.

Because I have profit now, but my average stock cost is now $20 per stock, but if I didn't sell, my average cost would be $10 still.

 Because it seems that this strategy increases the average cost of my stocks every time I sell and buy, and it also gives me less profit every time too.

They know how to pull the rug out on both sides. 

When Gamestop Squeeze occurred they got caught with over 100% of the float shorted… here with AMC, there is only about 20% to 30% of the float short. Also, with GME, wallstreet and hedgefunds didn’t see it coming and even if they caught wind of it they scoffed at it and did not believe it would amount to anything at all. 

This time around though – they know that WSB has the ammo and enough retail investors on board to create some real havoc for hedge funds. I guarantee you multiple people at hedge funds have eyes on the reddit boards at all times. I believe some of them create posts on reddits like this one too.

On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote...

and balking at even a penny of additional liquidity. How the Fed will continue to monetize debt then, when the repo system is now out of collateral, is anyone's guess.

By mid-July, we’ll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase higher yields in the FX swap market amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative

Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho.

“Rising prices of raw materials – metals, plastic casings, copper to make [home appliance] chips – have eroded the profits of all upstream and downstream enterprises in our entire industry,” said Zheng Leqiang, who runs a kitchen-appliances factory in Zhongshan, Guangdong.

Shares of AMC Entertainment ([AMC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC?p=AMC)) surged over 45% in afternoon trading Thursday, pushing the market capitalization of the country's largest theater chain past $12 billion amid a boost from retail investors.

At market close, AMC was still up over 35% with a market value of just $11.94 billion.

AMC, [which narrowly avoided bankruptcy](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amc-movie-theater-avoid-bankruptcy/) earlier this year, belongs to a class of so-called meme stocks including GameStop ([GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/)) and Bed Bath and Beyond ([BBBY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY/)). Retail investors active on the [subreddit WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) have crowded into stocks of these underdog companies in an effort to force short sellers to buy them to cover their positions. This squeeze on short sellers drives the stock prices even higher.

Brick-and-mortar video game retailer GameStop, the most notable meme stock, soared over 15% on Wednesday and added another 5% on Thursday.

Retail traders on WallStreetBets talked up AMC on Thursday, with one calling the theater a ""rocket ship,"" another urging fellow Redditors ""don't sell!"" and still another asking if it ""can go to the moon?""

910,2021-05-28,StockMarket,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",nmohy9,"['AMC', 'AI']",0
918,2021-05-28,StockMarket,"Listen up, fellas.  
Pull up a chair. I'm here to tell you about some smart people shit.

Whenever you see a company with $325 million revenue but a market cap of only $300 million you want to take a close look especially when you know the revenue is going to continue in the future.

Here's the deal:

Have you gotten your vaccine yet? Chances are you were stuck with an RVP Retractable Technologies needle.  
If the needle was retractable, that's the one. Retractable Technologies.  
That's the ticket.

RVP just had earnings last week, and it blew earnings out of the water.  
Why? Because half the country is half-vaccinated, dummies. That's a shit-ton of needles they went through last quarter.  
And now the other half of the vaccinations have to get stuck into people. And then the other half of the country needs to get their vaccines too.

But wait, there's more.  
""Dumbshits don't want to get vaccinated, man. COVID Vaxxes in the United States are over, moron!""  
BOMP! That's where you're wrong, knuckledraggers!  
First off, people are getting vaccinated at baseball games and shit now. There are still people out there who need their shot - haven't had the time, don't think it's a priority, whatever - who aren't opposed but it just hasn't been easy or fun. You can literally catch a foul ball, choke on a hotdog, and get vaccinated at the same time now.  
Also more importantly the United States isn't the whole world. People seem to forget that when they buy stock in Apple or Nike or whatever other boring-ass companies are stable. Those companies have high market cap because their shit is available worldwide and people want it.  
Well guess what: people in other countries haven't had the chance to call the COVID vaccine passé bullshit the same way we have here. They're still waiting for their shots. The White House has a bunch of pull-up-machine jarhead fuckin' Marine Corps motherfuckers packing boxes of RETRACTIBLE TECHNOLOGIES' NEEDLES inbetween sets of burpees and puking because they ran 5-minute miles in desert heat and then those boxes are getting shipped worldwide.

As a matter of fact, the demand is so damn high worldwide that the feds cut a $27M check to help Retractable increase *production capability* so that they can keep up with the demand for the worldwide shipment orders that are going to **keep coming in** from DOD and HHS and so that they can eventually get to the backlog of orders that they still have coming in from the private sector.

""Why the fuck do people want these needles? Any needle will do, right?""  
Are you serious? Ever heard the phrase ""whoever builds a better mousetrap..."" ???  
Here's your better mousetrap. And this company owns the patent for it.  
*There are other companies that make retractable low deadspace needles on the market, but those companies have to pay RVP to use those technologies.*  
These are those fucking ""low deadspace"" needles you hear about on the news all the time that enable you to get more doses out of a vial. These needles retract so that the nurses don't prick their hands when they're juggling between getting a bandaid on your arm, disposing of the needle, and all the other stupid little steps in the process.  
Between the low deadspace making vaccine supply last longer and the NO ACCIDENTS thing, there's talk that insurance companies are going to start demanding that hospitals use these needles if they want to do business - both the patients' insurance companies AND THE MALPRACTICE INSURANCE COMPANIES **duh**.  
When I got my vaccine I asked the nurse what she thought about the retractable needle. She told me the fact that they had them there was a sign that the admins at the vax site gave a shit about them as employees. Admins are literally ordering these to keep nurses happy so they stay on the job.

So here's the deal: Bleecker Street is a short selling firm that tried to sink this ship. There are others involved in this that are shorting the hell out of it. The shorts are about twice the float right now.  
Bleecker's short report was basically ""CoViD iS oViD dUmBsHiTs ain't nobody gonna need needles after this!"" which is fucking dumb as hell because they aren't taking into account the following:

1. The government doesn't just give money to a company to **expand production capability** if they don't intend to keep ordering **in perpetuity**
2. COVID isn't the **only** disease we need vaccines for
3. Vaccines aren't the only things we need shots for. My dentist used one on me Monday. It did not retract. He openly stated that he wished he could get his hands on those instead.
4. The government isn't the only customer ordering these needles
5. OTHER NEEDLES SUCK TOTAL BALLS IN COMPARISON  
WOULDN'T YOU RATHER YOUR KIDS STEP ON A RETRACTABLE NEEDLE IN A DARK ALLEY INSTEAD OF ONE THAT WILL PRICK THEM WITH DOPE AND HepC?!
6. Needles administer vaccines and medicines to more than just humans. Anybody in here got a dog? Ever bring 'em in for a rabies shot?

Here's the chart below.

Holy cow - look at that consolidation! Look at how far down the hedgies have pushed it! It's spring-loaded, baby!

You can clearly see the first few contract announcements.  
Now they're one of the most shorted companies on the market and unlike our other short squeeze Cinderella Darlings, RVP is **already** cash rich, **already** has a backlog of private sector orders to get to, is ***not dependent*** on the government but is **expanding** capabilities... I mean this thing has the potential to fucking. rocket.

926,2021-05-28,StockMarket,"Im going to start by saying forgive me y’all. I’m still fairly new to buying stocks and all the lingo and stuff. Y’all talk about a lot of things I don’t fully understand yet. Regardless, the reason I joined this forum was because redditors seem to have a sixth sense about stocks and what’s going to go up and what’s going to go down. 

Not too long ago, I was up late one night scanning this forum to see what stocks people were talking about on here. A popular one people were talking about rising was AMC. So I bought in at $9.93 a share. Later, I saw it kept rising so I bought in a little more at around $13 and then more at $14. I haven’t bought any since and my now $220 invested is valued close to $430. 

I’m aware that there’s risk involved. There’s risk involved with buying any stocks. Some more than others. Anyways, I’ve come here today to all my fellow redditors to ask you; do I keep riding the wave or is it time to sell? I know no one is 100% sure about where it’s going, but I wanted to hear all of y’all’s opinions on this. So please, enlighten me with your opinions",nmoqlo,['AMC'],0
