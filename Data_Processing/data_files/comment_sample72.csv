Nevertheless, I strongly agree with the author. It should be a mandatory tutorial for every new investor to read before  starting their game. 

The problem is that even though we know all of it, we are still influenced by our psychology. 

FOMO (+lack of critical thinking) - whenever someone is posting his/her positive portfolio, I see follow-the-leader strategy, where people blindly jump ship without thinking why it is green and if it's sustainable or not.

Procrastination - Many people are just lazy. Why bother to learn how to do DD, when you can watch 1-2 videos, read few posts or just yolo into random or bluechip stock. We all did it at least once. Sometimes it went well, sometimes not...

Instant gratification - I think this is the most self-destructing mechanism. That's one of the reason why every subreddit has a daily thread. People are following their portfolio every day, wishing to see a sudden jump. We are very sensitive about any slight drop. It's okay if you are day trader or swing trader playing short/mid term, but many claims that they are long-term,  yet still follow their portfolio everyday.

The point of Bob is to highlight that even if you do buy at the peak, you'll still come out with a profit eventually. The issue is timing the bottom. Look at indexes, you'll see that in the past, there were times where it looked like the bottom had passed, before it found another bottom.

I need to balance it still and plan on the overall structure being:

60% ETF's
20% Stocks.  27-32 years.  7-9% interest rate
20% Crypto

ETF's being: $27,000
30% VONG --for high growth large cap

10% VTI --for a mix of everything
5% VSS --for slight exposure to other non US markets

         Plug Power- $1207
          Nio- $906

*I'm thinking about AMD or NVIDIA, Tilray, Sony. No idea what other sectors are decent to invest in as service providers like Edison or PGE have looked terrible since I started investing, and I don't know what other companies might be a good decision.

Crypto being: $9200

______________________________________________________

FIRE (If 50 counts)

This is based ONLY on my ETF's so I will hopefully have a lot of wiggle room to get to this point and stay there or grow before accounting for my stocks, crypto, and 401k.

I used investor.gov compound interest calculator. Assuming I put $27,000 in with monthly contributions of $1500 (should be possible) at an interest rate of 7-9% for 27-32 years, at 50-55 years old I will have ~$2,125,000.

From there, withdrawals of ~8500/month pretax at even 5% will result in more money being made than spent, after 40 years the total being $2,638,000. 

Did I do this correctly and is it realistic? I'd like to think that an average 7% return is reasonable and even conservative. Maybe I'm overthinking it but aside from taxes, is the separation of the ETF's between a RIRA and normal exchange going to make an impact on that $2,000,000?

1 - Learn about indexes and industries rather than individual companies. This will open up the world of index funds and ETFs.

2 - Learn about the big name blue chips. Now you're looking at the companies that you see around you in everyday life like Apple and Google. Fundamentally, these companies are rock solid but you'll need to keep an eye out to see if there are any changes that will make you want to sell your stake and move on.

3 - Start diving deeper and understand dividends and dividend aristocrats. You'll learn how to tie in the growth of the stock with the dividend yield/growth rate.  

4 - Now you're knowledgeable enough to get into fundamentals and understand how companies trade relative to fundamentals. This allows you to look for values in budding industries that you may not immediately be familiar with. Now you're starting to get into an advanced level.

5 - Next is technical analysis and charting.  This allows you to get into short term investing for quick profits.

Yes, the Capital Gains tax will be effective Jan 2021.  Meaning what ever you did between when it becomes tax policy and Jan 1st, it will be included.  I've heard, this $million in income is BS.  That # will be far less.  

Just like Obamacare.  The first year, he didn't collect a thing through payroll.  He collected all that tax at once, straight out of cash.  

Truth is, there are people who will get sick of the tax policy and just flat out retire. Then what?  That tax bill will seep deep into middle class territory.   I'm set up for several years and more, I have the cash set aside.  

But please explain how giving a person $300 for their under 5 year olds is infrastructure?  And $250 til they are 18.  Yellen must be off her rocker to have been put up to even making that case yesterday.  

This is why wages are up here anyway, because people are being incentivized to stay home and now July 15th even more so.
