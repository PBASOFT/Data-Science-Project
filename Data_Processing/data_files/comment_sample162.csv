1) Tax advantage retirement accounts - 401(k) through work, IRA, (SEP if self-employed). 

This is money you generally won't touch until retirement, but the government lets you invest it without getting taxed while doing so.

&#x200B;

2) Retirement portfolio - Index ETF investing. Common ETFs: VTI (total market), SPY (S&P 500), QQQ (NASDAQ), DIA (Down Jones Industrial Average), IWB (Russel 1000), and IWM (Russel 2000).

 You really only need to learn to invest into 4 or 5 things that invest into most of the market for you.

74,gzsxvge,2021-05-28,t1_gzsr1ak,stocks,"People have been pointing at the 21 day cycle for the past two-three months. It’s based on measurable and public data (for the most part, ftds in foreign markets are not subject to the same transparency rules as they are in US markets).

At what point does that guy who predicted a rise in price on a specific day two weeks ago based on a certain set of criteria go from conspiracy theorist to “guy who’s right?” Honest question? Like say I predict the sun is going to come up tomorrow based on certain mathematical models suggesting the earth is spinning as it rotates around the sun in an elliptical orbit. I’m not a conspiracy theorist - that’s a testable hypotheses, and after measuring the results we can see the hypothesis to be the best explanation of why and how things happen when they do. If later on, it turns out that there’s a better explanation that gives more reliable results, we move over to that hypothesis as the best explanation. Pretty basic science right?

So if somebody comes along and says “hey, I think the shorts are hiding their positions in the options chains by creating synthetic long positions with married puts” it’s an acknowledged phenomenon, it’s recognized by regulatory experts, the sec, everybody knows it’s a thing. It’s not an “out there” theory. 

And then they say “I think there would be these signals that such is the case if this is true” and we look at the options chain and sure enough, they reflect exactly what the hypothesis suggested. And then the hypothesis goes on to state that if this is the case, based on established ftd times that are allowed for certain trading bodies like market makers, we should see a rise in price as they have to purchase a new round of shares to cover their old round of ftds in X timeframe. And sure enough, the price spikes reliably on that timeframe. 

At what point does this move from conspiracy theory to science? 

It’s no skin off my back. The truth is, those of us who have made buying and selling decisions based on this theory have made astronomical returns. I don’t really care if you as an investor decide to accept the hypothesis as truth, because the results will happen whether or not you choose to accept them. 

At this point, the short positions are utter dogshit, the type that will bankrupt them, and everybody in the industry knows it. So they won’t find a sucker to buy them. The best they can manage is to kick the can down the road. They’ll run out of runway eventually, and there’s no telling when that will be, but in the mean time, we can guess pretty accurately when the price will rise until they run out of runway. 

Are individual securities and wider economic shifts and corrections really just black magic that takes everybody by surprise? Or are there signals out there? How is it that some people seem to be able to say “I think the market is going to be bullish for these reasons” and be correct the large majority of the time, or somebody to say “I think we’re about to experience a major correction and downturn based on these other criteria” with frightening accuracy? Did Burry get lucky when he went all in on shorting mbs in 2006, and then held through massive unrealized losses until it turned out he was right? Or was it possible that he was right and all the people suggesting he was a conspiracy theorist were wrong all along? 

Like I said - no skin off my back. I’m up about 2800% for the year and that number is rising monthly - and I expect it to continue to rise. Whether or not anybody here decides “maybe they know something that I don’t” doesn’t stress me out even a little bit. I’m mostly just kinda scratching my head watching the hubris of this subreddit in thinking they have all the answers and that everybody is stupid except them, and wondering about what goes into that kind of mindset. 

But I suppose it’s normal for two companies to randomly jump 50% and 100%+ in a week on no news at all, and that it was simply a matter of retail fomoing in and pumping the price of these two random stocks up by billions in market cap. That’s probably a more reasonable explanation than “maybe these people know something I don’t.”

167,gzt3bxi,2021-05-28,t3_nn2qne,stocks,"Though these arent bad picks, I personally dont recommend it. Im a tech guy too but I play it much more defensively at a time when valuations are high. Remember its not just current valuation, there is also macro conditions to consider. 

For example, right now, the entire market PE is in bubble territory with the S&P500 PE hovering around 45. Even though we can explain this rationally with covid earnings, low interest, bonds being dead money, inflation, and other things, markets are not rational.

So for me personally, I play defensive when the macro indicators are bad. Thats not to say I dont like AMZN, GOOG, APPL or MSFT, but that I dont trust valuations. 

Right now I am basically running 25% cash, and I would say 50% of my actual portfolio (not including the cash) is defensive. Consumer cyclicals, consumer non-cyclicals, blue chip with low PE+Div growth, real estate and I even have some fixed income (preferred stock for REITs I consider reliable long term). 

I would suggest you take the macro indicators into account. I also highly recommend a div paying strategy and letting the pot of cash build itself for dips and crashes.

Now if markets PE starts to look good again (sub 30), then I would probably switch the strategy to what you are doing and just buy high growth cash cows. Which is what I basically did last year in the crash and in the financial crash though I didnt buy tech specifically this time around.

But as they say, history doesnt always get it right. Right now things are a bit hazy. Supply is so ridiculously low that I am not sure inflation or deflation will slow the price hike down but at the same time, rents are going up and we are expecting a lot of evictions soon for residential. Commercial real estate is still struggling while healthcare/agricultural realty is booming.

You won't win this game. 2) Obviously then either buy and hold ETF or buy and hold solid companies. In terms of companies and perhaps answering your question avoid companies that have a lot of debt. Its all well and good having massive debt pile while interest rates are at 0.

286,gzte5b4,2021-05-28,t3_nna2po,stocks,"First of all there’s nothing wrong with not going to college. The trades are every bit as important as any other job, and speaking as an architect they take just as much skill and knowledge as any other profession, plus as there are less and less people joining the trades demand for skilled tradesman will increase and the pay will get even better. 

As far as investing advice, I think it’s wise to invest extra once you have a healthy emergency savings. That said always keep on eye on the future. If you are planning on a big purchase and will end up needing to sell stocks, it may be a good idea to beef up the savings because a swing in the market could hamper your ability to make that big purchase. For example, if you’re planning on buying a house I wouldn’t use a brokerage account as my “savings” account for the down payment. Someone might argue you could put it somewhere relatively “safe” in the market like a broad index fund, but even then anything can happen.

Beyond that I think you’ve got the basics down. Compounding is your best friend, but keep in mind that stocks can always go down, so your ROI may go from say the 14 yrs you predicted when you buy something to 100 with a dividend cut. For that reason make sure you do your due diligence on stocks you plan on holding for a long time. Think about the industry and whether it will even be around at the end of your predicted ROI period. 

Also because you are young then growth stocks aren’t necessarily a bad thing so you might want to portion at least a small part of your portfolio into them even if they don’t pay dividends yet. For example, someone who bought Amazon 20yrs ago would be a lot better off than someone who bought an equal amount of T.",[],1
287,gzte5qs,2021-05-28,t3_nmzgs1,stocks,"I think that Gold and Silver would not be great if they rise interest rates as increased interest rates tend to control inflation which is what boosts gold and silver (and any other commodity) in the first place.

Banks, insurance companies, mortgage companies and REITs, companies with a lot of cash on hand will also get some earnings boost (FB, AAPL, AMZN), companies with a lot of debt will likely fumble (there's a lot of them right now).

Not sure about dividend stocks, they're always kind of balanced apart from during high inflation. I guess the dividend premium over the risk-free rate would be lower so their valuation could drop a bit, but they're still good investments (as long as the business is doing well and the company is not debt-heavy).

You shouldn’t be investing in dividend stocks at your age (im the same age) unless you seriously need the extra income which is probably not much anyway. Open a Roth IRA and you can contribute up to $6000 each year if you can afford it. Roth IRAs are funded with after tax money so any dividends or realized capital gains are not taxed. If you want to keep it simple, buy 70% VTI and 30% VXUS. Rebalance every six months. These will grow a ton by the time you retire. You can’t take out money tax free from an IRA until you are 59.5 years old unless it’s the initial contributions.

For new investors, this is the problem with focusing on dividends and especially high yielding companies. They have high yields for a reason, most of the time being, the company's business or the company itself is distressed. As a result inexperienced investors get suckered in and constantly underperform the market for years, for example if you bought a high yielder like AT&T a few years ago, your returns are nowhere near a decent portfolio of ETFs. So, no you won't be guaranteed to make your money back in 14 years, in fact you can lose money if the company stays distressed and never turns around and there are plenty of examples of this from 2008. Your focus on dividends is too simplistic because dividends are not the only reason a company has value.

What you should be focusing on is a company's quality and its potential for present and future returns to shareholders. Now of course dividends are a part of that equation, but only a part, but so are share buybacks, M&A value, and growth potential. For example did you know that Apple's total shareholder return this year is around 5%, even though the dividend is only less than 1%? This is because of share buybacks, 90 billion dollars of it, which can be better than dividends tax-wise. This also means that if Apple's price stays the same in a year, it's market cap will go down by around 5%. This isn't to say that dividends, even high yielding ones, aren't a good thing, but they should only be a part, and often a very small part, of the reason you are investing in a company.

INRG 9%

VFEM 8%

IITU 7%

VUSA 6%

VHYL 5%

ISF 4%

INRG: iShares Global Clean Energy (this thing is just popping off like crazy, started at 521GBX Jan 2020, hit a high of 1425 and since then declined to 921. Considering that it nearly tripled in a single year as an ETF that's understandable though)

VFEM: Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (more risky, but generally speaking higher potential)

IITU: iShares S&P 500 Information Techonology (as an IT worker I'm a sucker for IT, so that's a personal choice)

VUSA: Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (wide coverage, this time for the USA specifically)

VHYL: Vanguard FTSE All-World High Dividend (for the rougher, rather meant to counter bad times. Not really necessary at all, but I like a low percentage in it)

ISF: iShares Core FTSE 100 (covers a lot, decent return)

They are no LMT, HAL etc but there is lots of existing proof of problem solving on PLTRs end. Tenuous relationships are a possibility but not so sure since they deal with data (obvs secrets) and some public good.

I have a similar POV that republicans talk about war, democrats will actually go to war. So that would most certainly keep the relationships rolling. Also since they deal with data, I feel it’s so hard to pull out a vendor who has that much analytics back story, let alone security protocol on simply a party change. 

Full disclosure I work in digital media and scored a small navy contract 10 years ago. It was a life changing event for my business partner and I. So I definitely have a bias toward the positivity of government contracts, also why I’m over bullish and long on PLTR. What concerns me is the absurdity of the 1Billion+ share float.

572,gzu07l6,2021-05-29,t3_nna2po,stocks,"Few thoughts...

1) Beyond the topics discussed here. Look into 1) how top open a tax advantaged account for retirement, 2) Figure out how much you need to save each year to be ready for retirement (If you start at your age 15% will do, if you put this off it could be 20%, 25% or more), and 3) create a portfolio for retirement. Do this early and the percentage you need to save stays low.

After this consider saving up a little extra that is non-retirement that will let you have access to the cash in the future. It will mostly be taxable.

&#x200B;

Dividends are too often ignored, but they're great. Just make sure you have dividend reinvesting turned on. Too many brokerage websites favor growth stocks in how they display information to investors, because they only easily report back unrealized gains %, not cumulative gains % from the investment that includes dividends and dividend reinvestments. I've always been strong in dividends. I have T, JPM, PFE, CSX, and CSCO amongst others.

I still have plenty of Growth stocks and growth stocks have outpaced value stocks for the last decade or two, even with those dividends. I really blend both sides together. I scale back my growth stocks when I think the market is getting too risky and I increase Value and Cash. When I think the bull market will last longer I buy more growth. And we have had alot of bull market lately.... perhaps a bit too much.

I also don't ignore small and mid caps. There are times these do not perform as well, but there are times they outperform.

So I have T too. I don't want to convince you ditch it, but when a dividend gets that high, it means investors are expecting it to drop in value over time. They're worried they are getting increased competition or some of their products are losing consumers to technological innovation in other parts of the market. So in response T stops reinvesting into their business and they pay out well to shareholders, while they are profitable, anticipating a slow decline in their core business.

Now some new news....And I think this is mostly good. The company is splitting into two companies, so you will soon have 2 stocks, T and a new company.  1 will be a growth company that is Time Warner + Discovery Networks (merged) that are going to try a streaming television company to take on Netflix and others. This likely won't have a dividend.  The other will be T with its original core communications business intact, with their entertainment companies removed. The dividend is going to be cut in half. They're going to start investing into 5G networks in a large scale, while selling off their cable/satellite businesses, and it is going to take capitol, so they can't pay as large of a dividend.  The down side as an investor is we know this is needed for them to compete with Verizon and T-Mobile/Sprint, but we don't know that this will actually lead to anymore revenue. We just know they have to do it to keep up with consumers expectations and competition from the other mobile carriers.

We don't know yet if they can get extra revenue from connecting cars and/or other consumer electronic devices to a 5G network that can handle more than smartphones. We know that technology is possible, but as an investor we want to know they will get more money from consumers for that investment.

&#x200B;

Also, be careful with the ""Don't put in what you're not willing to lose"" argument. That is great advice for someone who is jumping into GME, high-growth/high-risk, and non-diversified gambles. But to plan for your retirement, you really need to invest your whole retirement savings in to the correct, cautious, diversified way to make it by age 65. Rather than trying to get large gains on a gamble, you take normal market gains and let time work to your advantage.

One of the first lessons I learned was the true cost of doing nothing. When I first started I was older than you, but I had about $20k in savings accounts. I made an investment account and moved my money over (I used Merrill Edge). There is a Performance chart that will let you compare how well your whole account does over time vs. any index. I default it to S&P 500 with total returns. Nearly 8 years later it shows S&P 500 TR up over 200%. My account up 140%. I compare my account in the last 1 year, 3 year, and 5 years and I'm tracking the S&P 500 TR or slightly ahead.

My first investment was a single mutual fund that I didn't get for 5 month and I only got $3000 worth. I didn't invest the rest of my money for another year. Now that was a really good year, but it didn't go up 60%. I just no longer have those gains from the first year (1.5 years, actually) also reinvested and giving me compounded gains.

Now much of this happened because I was too busy. My work was 100% travel where I couldn't get online much, but I really wish I had simple advice that was just put it in an Index fund, like SPY or VTI, until I feel more comfortable and adequately had time to read up on everything else. My original investment could be worth an additional $12k if I had and this number will grow over time, because of the compounded gains I would've gotten with that extra $12k invested now.

There is a cost of doing nothing. Just stay clear of risky things, non-diversified things, leveraged funds, high-risk funds, etc... until you really know what you're doing, understand them, and can lose that money your risking into a riskier idea.

That is my advice to you... diversify, get it all invested, but don't rely on just a few dividend stocks. Diversify with growth stocks too.

Start simple with a market index ETF. SPY buys you a piece of everything in the S&P 500, the 500 largest companies in the market. Diversify into other investment ideas once you feel comfortable. Don't put too much money into a single stock, unless you can stand to lose it, but don't let that stop you from investing for your retirement in a diversified market fund.

The only thing that should run counter to this, is you should still have a savings account where you put emergency funds for when your car breaks, house catches on fire (happened to me Jan 2020), lose your job, etc... If that happens simultaneously with a recession or dip in the market, you want funds you can grab without worry about your investments rebounding.

While they do have long, option, swing trades that they call out, the main philosophy followed for trades is momentum daytrades. 

Even on a small account I easily make my sub price back each month and I've learned a lot.

Now dont misunderstand. The point isnt to hold cash long. The point is always be ready for opportunity. It doesn't always stay sidelined. For example, in 2019 I put half the cash into Tesla when it dipped. Early 2020, around Fed, I reset again (sold Tesla) and guess what happened next? 

The Covid crash was unplanned, but obviously this is what I keep cash around for (did same for financial crash)... I didnt hit the absolute bottom. I did hedge on the way down and overshot a bit on the way up but I managed to deploy all the cash at about 10% above bottom so not bad. Needless to say, my returns last year were good though nothing like the financial crash. 

By year end I started to reduce again but I made the mistake of falling in love with one my positions and have not reduced it... yea I know it sounds like a mistake but I just cant do it (lol). I can reduce some of my fixed income stuff soon (almost 1 year) so I will probably do that since those all recovered to face value anyway.

This year has been interesting. My portfolio isnt up much (about 20% so far) but the surprise has been real estate. RE usually lags at around 10%-15% yoy with rents and capital gain estimates but so far this year, that is way up. Cap gains alone are up 15%-20% so far.

Short-term movements make little sense sometimes fundamentally. Over the long term, the noise and randomness is ironed out. Plus, there's always the chance that you've missed some news or something.

Saturday expiration is between brokerage and exchange. The brokerage has deadline of 11:59AM on Saturday to exercise the contract with exchange and deliver the shares.   

Short contract holders however have deadline of 4pm. It is strongly advisable not to keep contracts open until market closes on the expiry day. Low trading volume can create some very odd price movements in the aftermarket, meaning short contracts can get exercised and you have no control over it.

For example: let's say they own 30 long and 20 short positions. One of the latter grows by 20%, and now they have to get more collateral. This means deleveraging themselves, for example selling part of one long.

Now if that makes the long position decline, then they have to sell more, which in turn reduces the price more. This only works so much until it's not effective anymore. Then they start covering shorts, which increases that price, which again makes the problem worse ..

Don’t think so…and that amount of unexpected movement and volatility can result in large gains…or huge losses in record time. Huge gains are nice, but I’m personally not willing to risk it.","['GME', 'AMC']",0

They sell products to managers who don't want to learn html, but love to be crippled by what sharepoint can not do. MS even managed to get the open source community to develop the windows calculator for them. It's MS DOS all over again. They have crippled the Internet for 20 years. They have destroyed competitors with better software. I don't like them at all. And now the facade of gramps and do-gooder Bill starts to fall apart too.",[],0

What I probably should've said is all of their current offerings are baked in to their current valuation due to their maturity. For example, we know air pods aren't going to double in sales this year. Without a new and exciting launch, I expect their stock to trade sideways for a while. They're valued at close to $2T already.",[],0
