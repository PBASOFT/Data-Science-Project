Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

# The Cash Flow Statement

The  main objective of the Cash Flow Statement (or Statement of Cash Flows)  is to explain how much and why the cash balance of a business changed  during the period of analysis.

**The cash flow statement is typically broken into three sections:**

* **Operating activities**
   * Detail  cash flow that’s generated once the company delivers its regular  goods  or services, and includes both revenue and expenses.
* **Investing activities**
   * Include  cash flow from purchasing or selling assets—think physical  property,  such as real estate or vehicles, and non-physical property,  like  patents—using free cash, not debt.
* **Financing activities**
   * Detail cash flow from both debt and equity financing.

>Based  on the cash flow statement, you can see how much cash different types  of activities generate, then make business decisions based on  your  analysis of financial statements.  
Ideally,  a company’s cash from operating income should routinely exceed its net  income, because a positive cash flow speaks to a  company’s ability to  remain solvent and grow its operations.  
It’s  important to note that cash flow is different from profit, which is why  a cash flow statement is often interpreted together with other  financial documents, such as a balance sheet and income statement.

**However, you will also find other information:**

* How much cash earnings the company had during the period, as contrasted with accrual earnings (in income statements)
* How much and where the company reinvested cash during the period to sustain and grow its business
* How much cash it raised from or returned to its debt and equity investors

The  Cash Flow Statement preserves the signs on cash flows, with negative  cash flows shown as minuses and positive cash flows as pluses. It also  looks at cash flows through the eyes of equity investors in the company.

**Positive cash flow**

* Indicates  that a company has more  money flowing into the business than out of it  over a specified period.  This is an ideal situation to be in because  having an excess of cash  allows the company to reinvest in itself and  its shareholders, settle  debt payments, and find new ways to grow the  business.
* Positive  cash flow does not necessarily translate to profit, however.  Your  business can be profitable without being cash flow-positive, and  you  can have positive cash flow without actually making a profit.

**Negative cash flow**

* Having **negative cash**  flow means your cash outflow is  higher than your cash inflow during a  period, but it doesn’t  necessarily mean profit is lost. Instead,  negative cash flow may be  caused by expenditure and income mismatch,  which should be addressed as  soon as possible.
* Negative  cash flow may also be caused by a company’s decision to  expand the  business and invest in future growth, so it’s important to  analyze  changes in cash flow from one period to another, which can  indicate how  a company is performing overall.

# Cash Flows from Operations

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [**https://imgur.com/GEBa8Zy**](https://imgur.com/GEBa8Zy) 

**Working Capital**

Embedded in the cash flow from operations is the **change in working capital items, excluding cash**

* Non-cash Working capital = Non-cash current assets – Non-debt current liabilities
* An  increase in non-cash working capital will decrease cash flows, whereas a  decrease in non-cash working capital will increase cash flows.

Non-cash  working capital ties up cash and capital, a firm with higher needs for  that working capital will have lower cash flows from operations, for any  given level of net income, than a firm with lower needs.

# Cash Flows from Investing

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [**https://imgur.com/TYgP2y8**](https://imgur.com/TYgP2y8) 

**Operating or Non-operating Assets**

* The  investing activities section includes investments in both operating and  non-operating assets, except for investment in liquid, close to  riskless securities, which is treated as cash & marketable  securities.
* The  investments into operating assets, whether internal (capex, net of  divestitures) or external (acquisitions of other companies) are the  engine that drives growth in the operating line items (revenues,  operating income etc.)

>*Note that acquisitions funded with stock will not show up here for obvious reasons.*

* The  investments into non-operating assets create a separate source of  value, where the payoff will not show up in the operating line items but  below the operating income line, as income from cross holdings or  securities.

# Cash Flows from Financing

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [**https://imgur.com/JqZv2kY**](https://imgur.com/JqZv2kY) 

**Debt Cash Flows**

* While  interest expenses show up in the operating cash flow section, by  reducing net income and showing up in deferred taxes, debt repayments  are part of the financing section.
* To  the extent that some or all of these debt repayments are funded with  debt issuance's, the net effect on cash flows can be neutralized or  become positive.

>**If  total debt increases during a period, it will represent a cash inflow,  and if it decreases, it will be a cash outflow. Companies that embark on  plans to bring their debt down (up) over time should therefore expect  these consequences.**

**Dividends and Buybacks**

* Until  the 1980s, the only cash flow that was received by equity investors in  publicly traded companies was dividends. The effect of paying dividends  is simple: it reduces the cash balance of the company and increases the  cash in the pockets of every shareholder who receives dividends.
* Starting in the 1980s, US companies have returned increasing amounts to their shareholders in the form of buybacks.  

   * The effect of buying back stock is exactly the same as paying dividends, to the company, with cash leaving the company.
   * For  shareholders, though, the cash flow effect is disparate. Those  shareholders who sell their shares back get cash from the company, and  those that do not get no cash, but get a larger share of the equity left  in the company.
   * Both dividends and buybacks reduce shareholder equity on the balance sheet.

597,2021-05-28,stocks,"This is a reminder to all emotional investors/traders out there: Don't panic sell!

I made a bunch of stupid moves the week of May 10 when the market was taking its second downturn. If I just walked way from my computer for 2 weeks, most of the moves I made would have recovered. But unstead now I'm sitting on missed gains because I got too emotional.

Investing/trading is not about emotion. It's about having a plan and sticking to it.

I'm terrible at it because I still panic when macro factors test the strength of my plan.

Here are some of the lessons I'd like new traders/investors to really take to heart:

- When you buy a stock, have a VERY clear idea on why you bought, how long you're holding, and what your exit strategy is. I cannot stress this enough. There are many times where I bought a stock to flip, and I ended up holding it long term as a bag holder because I got greedy. And there are many times I bought stock I believed in, but ended up selling it on a correction because I panicked. Be incredibly regimented about this.

- Understand that corrections occur, and make a plan on how you'll deal with it. If you started buying high growth/beta stocks in January or February, you're account is probably down 20% from its peak. Thats okay, take a DEEP breath and think through your strategy. Did you leave any money to DCA your positions down? Ex. You bought ENPH at $220, its $140 right now. Do you still believe in ENPH? Why did you buy it at $220 and what has fundamentally changed about the company now that its at $140?

- Understand the power of averaging down.You can't time tops or bottoms. But you can make a strategy to mitigate risks. If any stocks you own have a beta higher than 2, seriously consider making an average down strategy. Averaging down is a very powerful tool, but you need to plan ahead for it. Stocks are great if they're only going up, but any high growth stock will come back down on small catalysts that throws into jeopardy their future growth. Those things can be macro factors as well such as interest rates and inflation fears. Here's a simple example using NIO. NIO was trading at $64 on January 20 after NIO day. There were definitely people who bought NIO at that price. Lets assume you bought 100 shares of NIO for $6400. NIO since then has been on a brutal slide. Its found its bottom at $31 twice now, but its still unclear what the real bottom is. At the same time, more analysts have reiterated that NIO is a buy with a price target of about $60. So your cost average is $64 with a 100 shares. NIO is sitting at $38 today. You know there's a 20% downside to $31, and maybe it goes lower. But you also know that it has a potential upside to $64. The reality is, if you believe in NIO, and were proactive enough to have $6400 stored in case of an event like this, if you bought 168 shares of NIO for $38, and averaged down your position you're cost average for NIO become a much more reasonable $47 rather than $64. That means NIO only has to gain 20% from its current price rather than 80%. I've seen this written in this subreddit before, but averaging down on a position is one the greatest opportunities. It lets you recommit to the original thesis you had for a stock, and it also creates a more advantageous position in the long term.

That said, be careful of ""buy the dip"". Understand why the dip is occurring. Compare the dip to macro factors like SPY and QQQ. Understand interest rates, inflation, international trade deals and other factors that could affect macro price movement. Use TA to understand support levels, and always be aware that things could drop more. April and May really tested the theory of ""it can't go any lower"". I was reading on this forum that April 27 was the end. That everything was going to recover since high flying stocks were on their bullish trajectory. Then we hit an inflation panic and the market corrected all high growth stocks by about 20%. OUCH.



Here's my big mistake. When I had no extra money to average down, and the stocks kept falling in May, I panicked. I managed to make it through February and March and most of April without panicking and selling. But May did me in. I ended up selling stocks to preserve capital, and most of those stocks are rebounding now and its making me realize that I wasn't as mentally strong as I thought.

Don't make these mistakes I did. Please make a strategy for yourself and stick with it! And don't keep changing strategies on a whim. That's another thing that will lead to compounding losses rather than tweaking and honing your strategy for what works for you!",nmwdby,[],0

* The   investments into non-operating assets create a separate source of   value, where the payoff will not show up in the operating line items but   below the operating income line, as income from cross holdings or   securities.

# Cash Flows from Financing

**Debt Cash Flows**

* While   interest expenses show up in the operating cash flow section, by   reducing net income and showing up in deferred taxes, debt repayments   are part of the financing section.
* To   the extent that some or all of these debt repayments are funded with   debt issuance's, the net effect on cash flows can be neutralized or   become positive.

>**If   total debt increases during a period, it will represent a cash inflow,   and if it decreases, it will be a cash outflow. Companies that embark  on  plans to bring their debt down (up) over time should therefore  expect  these consequences.**

**Dividends and Buybacks**

* Until   the 1980s, the only cash flow that was received by equity investors in   publicly traded companies was dividends. The effect of paying  dividends  is simple: it reduces the cash balance of the company and  increases the  cash in the pockets of every shareholder who receives  dividends.
* Starting in the 1980s, US companies have returned increasing amounts to their shareholders in the form of buybacks.
   * The effect of buying back stock is exactly the same as paying dividends, to the company, with cash leaving the company.
   * For   shareholders, though, the cash flow effect is disparate. Those   shareholders who sell their shares back get cash from the company, and   those that do not get no cash, but get a larger share of the equity left   in the company.
   * Both dividends and buybacks reduce shareholder equity on the balance sheet.

610,2021-05-28,stocks,"$SDC current price $8.15, one to keep on the radar, 75% institutional ownership, 29.54% short interest, that alone is recipe for a short squeeze. However it is actually a decent stock and its 52 week high was $16.08. The stock price took a beating due to a system software hack which has now been resolved, so i expect it to rapidly climb back to all time highs. 

I have also been listening/ watching the SDC investor conferences which have been going on since Monday and due to run till next week, and the CFO does fill me with a bit of confidence. I think this also filled a few institutions with confidence because i saw some large dark pool orders to the tune of around $35 million go through on wednesday the 26th of may. A play i am going to get into would be the $11 Calls for the 18th of June.  Please do your own research.",nmwg69,[],1

Anyways, I don’t know much about stocks. Basically only sell high, buy low. Just wondering if anyone could give me any suggestions on what to look out for! Btw the minimum price for a stock we’re allowed is $2.00. Thanks!",nmwsqw,[],0

I am too lazy to type a full-on DD. If this gets enough traction then I will do it with numbers. Basically, this is the best ganja plant company on planet Earth and is undervalued right now trading at 1.4x consensus rates compared to a trash peer group trading at 8x that on average. They are projected to have 115 stores EOY in Canada. They bought out FABCBD in the US and operate the largest E-Commerce platforms for cannabis in the world. Many of you have probably heard of GrassCity, CBDCity, and Smoke Cartel (they own these). They have celebrity licensing with Snoop and others and thousands of SKUs. They have a super clean balance sheet and positive adjusted EBITDA. They are cash positive and vertically integrated and scaling massively YOY with a dynamic team in place. They have plans to expand world-wide and continue to make great deals and acquisitions monthly. This is truly the best weed play on the entire market with tremendous upside. They just got approved to trade on the NASDAQ as well. It is currently trading at around $8. Personal PT EOY is $50. I can easily see this at $500 in 6 years or so. Do your research as I am not a financial advisor. I own 420 shares. I will answer any and all questions my fellow apes have.

943,2021-05-26,stocks,"Based on my extremely limited understanding, these hedge funds need to keep adding additional shorts to cover their initial shorts, but this isn't something that can go on forever. At some point they get squeezed and get killed with losses. 

If that happens, won't some of these hedge funds go bankrupt and their stocks become available? Thus lowering the price of the stocks they have large investments in? Thinking similar to how Archegos went down and their stocks took massive hits. $VIAC went down about 50% if I recall correctly. 

Is the risk to this squeeze becoming a much larger Archegos situation across many more stocks and causing a major market crash a legitimate concern?",nlq74u,[],0
