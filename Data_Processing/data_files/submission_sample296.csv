https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ndkhc2/my_stock_screener_results/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

So this is a post on how those stocks went.

Symbol, 	Old Price, 	Meet Filters, 	New Price, 	Percentage

AVHOQ, 	0.375, TRUE	, 0.42, 	12

CRRFY, 	4.172, 	TRUE	, 4.17, 	-0.05

RNVA, 	0.0009, 	FALSE	, 0.0009, 	0

SIGL, 1.025, 	FALSE	, 1.07, 	4.39

Average Change	3.96

Average Filter Change	7.25

So this is a pretty good week I would say.

Someone recently pointed out to me that a few of my results ran after a week so this is going back 2 weeks now:
https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/n8c7t2/my_stock_screener_results/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

HTZGQ	, 3.48	, FALSE, 6.6, 89.65

LTMAQ	, 2.3, 	FALSE,2.7,17. 39

So that's an average of 30.02% change in 2 weeks. You would however have been better off doing the 26.05% change on the first week then 7.25 of this week giving you 35.18% in the past 2 weeks (assuming you reinvested)

https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/njd23q/my_stock_screener_results_for_the_past_week/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

For those of you that don't know I have been working on a stock screener, I have big success in the past my highest week being 30% and my lowest is - 3% it is usually ~4-8% each week. Last week was a 7.25% increase. 

This weeks results:

Symbols, price, score

CRRFY	4.17	16.15290245

PSIX	4.21	8.166632081

SIGL	1.07	21.32972878

These results are from my own heuristic algorithm. Which essentially filters to make sure that the stocks meet certain criteria. 

First filter is that the revenue is twice the market cap, second is that the average volume from 60-30 days ago is less than the last 2 weeks. Third is price (under 5) and lastly is my movement filter which determines if the stock has had much movement in the past week. I obviously don't want to be catching a stock after the peak of pump and dump. This has been moved to part of the score. 

The score is new this week, I am not sure how well it will work but if it does that would be good. Its based on market cap revenue and volume. So if there is a higher volume then higher score, higher times the market cap fits into revenue etc.

I plan to host this on a website in the not so distant future. I in fact have it made and ready to go, just need to deploy it. 

I plan to create a ranking system on how likely I think it is to increase. 

I advise that everyone do your own research on these before investing, just an interesting thing to share.

I will be posting the results from these stocks and the next weeks results next weekend.

157,2021-05-23,pennystocks,"Huge upcoming moves for somewhat hidden gem WRHLF - Love Hemp. Currently Listed on OTCQB (and AQSE under $LIFE).

The run up this week to June 1 and beyond could be huge. The current SP is a minuscule 4.1 cents compared to it's potential in the short term. Seems to be flying under the radar for the most part - has relatively low volume thus far.

The company has a promotional partnership with UFC effective June 1 ([https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/world\_high\_life/news/rns/story/rmqd5vw](https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/world_high_life/news/rns/story/rmqd5vw)), with North American expansion marketing access to UFC fans. The agreement allows Love Hemp to access UFC’s physical and digital assets, as well as the marketing opportunities. This includes usage of UFC trademarks, logos and brand on a global basis, which will increase visibility and recognition across the 625 million UFC fans worldwide. Products are expected to be co-branded and UFC promotion of the company will begin.

Beyond the 1st, they'll continue taking off and growing the business and SP:

CATALYSTS

Possibly this week: PRs around ramping up for the June 1 UFC partnership and North America expansion, including the completion of the new production facility to increase volume up to 5x from current levels and will have the capacity to manufacture up to 500,000 CBD products a month.

June 1: Starts exclusive 5 year CBD partnership with UFC.

June 1: North American launch (currently in the UK market) to coincide with UFC partnership.

2021: Intent to up-list to London Stock Exchange (Europe's largest exchange) [https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/world\_high\_life/news/rns/story/x8o469r](https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/world_high_life/news/rns/story/x8o469r)

2021: Expansion into Japan/Germany/Korea/Australia. Will be within in 1 day delivery of 1 billion customers.

\-28mil market cap and approx 10mil sales. Many CBD companies have far higher market cap valuations though they have less sales. So much room for growth with this ticker on that fact alone. Virtually no debt. 8.89% owned by insiders / 16.63% owned by insiders + the largest (non-insider) shareholder. 83% publicly held shares.

\-Currently selling at \~2000 physical locations (including leading brands such as Sainsbury’s, Boots, Ocado and Holland & Barrett) with 40 product lines. Once the UFC deal gets underway, expected to increase volume massively as UFC consumers demand product. Amazing listing likely imminent.

\-U.S. Legal Cannabis Market Projected to Double to $41.5B by 2025 ([https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/09/2142171/0/en/U-S-Legal-Cannabis-Market-Projected-to-Double-to-41-5B-by-2025.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/09/2142171/0/en/U-S-Legal-Cannabis-Market-Projected-to-Double-to-41-5B-by-2025.html)). No doubt Love Hemp is well positioned over that time to capitalize on the growth of the market with the UFC partnership deal in particular. 

\-Founders of Love Hemp also founded Supreme Cannabis. They've recently re-signed (UFC's) Kamaru Usman as Brand Ambassador (Apr 22/2021 [https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/world\_high\_life/news/rns/story/w6qj3kr](https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/world_high_life/news/rns/story/w6qj3kr)) GSP was also a brand ambassidor previously.

On the flip side, with outstanding warrants shares could dilute up to around 29% eventually. However, not concerned as the current valuations and catalysts far outweigh the effects of the potential dilution. 

IMO amazing entry pricing at this point, considering the upcoming short and longer/2021-term catalysts. I'm in with avg 4 cents for \~100k and looking to add more this week as possible.

161,2021-05-23,pennystocks,"I think everybody is aware Rycey is my favorite long-term penny stock, I have been tracking it and the news for almost a year now. It's not a wild ride or a rocket it's an elevator to success. The amount of adjustment and moves they are making is exactly what they should be doing and they are right on track to turn this around towards the end of the year which is why I'm recommending to get in this now and HOLD. It will recover. It's Rolls-Royce ffs. This is a great price and 3-4Q is when it's expected to start climbing. 

So much info I suggest you actually read it all. 



Not too long ago Rolls Royce announced that it acquired the company Servowatch Systems with the aim of entering the ship automation industry. It is a significant development and one that will pay dividends long term. They also have recently partnered with Infosys a global leader in next-generation digital services and consulting. This will be used in their upcoming movement towards ship automation. 

 Not even mentioning 16,000 military engines with 160 customers in 103 different countries (war is always inevitable).

The good outlook 

A turning point?
Rolls-Royce sells jet engines for airliners along with many other ventures but it makes most of its profits from aftersales maintenance and support services. When aircraft are grounded, airlines don’t need these services because the engines aren’t in use.

However, that situation is starting to change. Aero engineer Meggitt reports that domestic flying in markets such as the US and China has already rebounded strongly. Here in the UK, the government is expected to start lifting restrictions on travel to Europe in May. Rolls-Royce isn’t expected to return to profit until late 2021 into 2022. But the stock market always looks forward and I think we’re at a turning point. In my view, the outlook for Rolls-Royce will start to improve during the second half of this year drastically. They are priced for bankruptcy on the market and this is way too pessimistic when aligned with the reality of how soon they can start to turn profit and what they have lined up. - This is from an analysis not me but matches my opinion. 

It's coming boys, patience is a virtue. Plus how safe can you get. Check the chart. It's an INVESTMENT. I understand that's a very rare word around here but tell me the last year has been normal. 

But why not leave you more, don't sleep on a solid investment.

Kenedy Lewis who was looking to buy the whole company during the pandemic ended up as 51 percent owner through stock on only the premium clubs TMPL? LIV and Palm Beach sports clubs. (TMPL isn't listed on site but I think its still part)

Town sports no longer owns NYSC BSC PSC and WSC. These assets were sold off to a private company and are not part of the stock. 

Patrick Walsh is still CEO of these clubs and had alot of his personal money invested in town sports which makes me belive he will do alot not to cancel the shares. 

The company now sits with its best club and a check book to compete in the gym biz worth about 100 million dollars (alot more then the current cap of 4 million) 

The company has added directors and has assigned them stock as compensation. 

So where to from here? Does the gym world pick up now that the pandemic is over in the US? I think so.

Does this stock get canceled? It seems town sports international llc was a subsidiary of Town sports holdings llc which also owned the premium clubs which aren't listed in the bankruptcy papers at all. I checked and don't see them.

433,2021-05-24,pennystocks,Relatively new to investing. Curious what are some of the better platforms for OTC or penny stock trading?,njojm0,[],1
468,2021-05-24,pennystocks,"I know the general deal with sub-penny stocks and have been investing on and off for a couple of  years now as a hobby. I have learned to use various stock screeners, look at Market Cap, previous week and month performance, 52-week range, the day's range, volume, average volume, do my research in various places for upcoming catalysts, news, new products, new ownership, acquisitions of other companies, etc.  I have also learned to check the 5-day and 1-month pricing, search for stocks that have dropped like 90% in price recently due to the market being down in general (because the odds of them going back up are pretty good) and stuff like that.

I have YOLO'ed into a number of .0001 penny stocks months ago when virtually every sub-penny stock was growing like crazy for no reason. Made thousands of dollars in profit during that time. I have also meticulously researched stocks, went with the flow of the masses and invested like crazy with tens of thousands of other people only to find out that a couple of ""great"" companies were a sham and their CEO was prosecuted because said product didn't exist at all.

I have learned the difference between market orders, limit orders and stop loss orders. A lot of what I have done so far, even when I took big losses, taught me valuable lessons of what to do and what not to do in the future. Now I'm looking for more info.

I have used the stock screeners of [otcmarkets.com](https://otcmarkets.com) and learned to look for the stocks that are defunct, have a stop sign on them, suspended by the SEC, etc. I've learned to look for signs that the company is going nowhere or potentially a scam. I have also used [barchart.com](https://barchart.com) and some other places for even more screening of stocks because with otcmarkets, while helpful in some ways in regards to finding out if a stock is legit or not, the actual stock price is always incorrect. Typically it is already way higher than what otcmarkets lists. It will say .0001 and when you look on somewhere like Yahoo Finance or any broker website, the price is like .0015 and has been for sometimes weeks.

I know that in general .0001 stocks are a shot in the dark. However, if one researches a good company that already has a decent amount of employees, potential future news/catalysts and such...it can't go down anymore without going out of business. The chances of it going up are much higher, however.

I find that I have problems buying a lot of sub-penny stocks even when they have SEC filings/earnings posted, I exceed the bid price, match the current ask price and it has tens or even hundreds of millions in volume daily. It just sits there until the day is done and the order is still ""open"" for no reason. I've noticed that a lot lately, even with stocks that have hundreds of millions of shares being traded daily. I see nothing that I'm doing incorrectly.

I have also noticed that some sites like [Barchart.com](https://Barchart.com) are way more up to date with more .0001 stocks and current prices compared to even [otcmarkets.com](https://otcmarkets.com) and that's a bit puzzling.

This got me to wondering...is there a website where I can find NEW .0001 startup companies that don't have a large following yet and are just coming to market? Surely there has to be SOME kind of official list at the SEC or elsewhere where these new startup companies are listed when they first go onto the market as a .0001 stock. Granted, it could be a long time before they actually see growth. In the meantime, I'm one of the people who starts out with a million shares, waits for it to go to .0002 and sells, then buys back 2 million shares again at .0001. I like to gather tens of millions of shares and then hold for future growth. Then do the same for other stocks simultaneously.

IF TLDR: What sites do you guys use for stock screeners for .0001 penny stocks and where can I find an official list of new companies coming to the market as .0001 stocks?

I know that a lot of .0001 stocks were also previously existing companies that had a higher stock price and some scandal, issue, etc., happened and they fell down to a triple zero stock. But I don't feel that it is unreasonable in any way to think that there must be a list somewhere of officially new companies that are literally just starting out and offering stocks at .0001. There has to be somewhere. Where can I find it and what is it called?",njpq9i,[],1

It seems that pennystocks and OTCs in particular, fundemental DD seems to resolve around, company dropping fins and working on current status followed by shareholder letter or some big announcement, or other news like mergers, custos, reinstatements, etc... 

Basically it seems that DD for OTCs is more short term and riding the hype and not something like ""hey this 5B outstanding shares company has a cool concept and good growth potential for next 5 years"" so its tough for me to value it long term.

I am curious how to value these things short term?

You will see the current rules and the updated rules below.

I   am thinking once companies who are not current or in danger of not   being traded on public exchanges start dropping filing after filing,   there will be the beginning of an OTC trend.

Lets   assume not every company will or can go current. So I wanted a place   for us to post a company ticker that we feel will make all the   appropriate filings to go pink current with updated information. Lets   not forget, there are Pink current with no information. SEC wants   updated information, but if you read the rules, you will also see   international companies who are listed on a major exchange with no   information on OTC are exempt from the rules and can remain current pink   on OTC.

**So who can get current before September**?   I ask that you PLEASE do not post just any OTC ticker. Post tickers   that you know is not current/missing info, is still active, and you feel   they have put in enough time and money to grow that they would be   foolish not to get current. Also please give an explanation why you   think they are a good candidate to go current before September and if   you want to include links that is fine too.

I will start,

588,2021-05-22,pennystocks,"Just last Friday, May 14th, Tellurian CEO [Octávio Simões was Appointed Chairman of the U.S. Chamber’s U.S.-Korea Business Council](https://www.uschamber.com/press-release/oct-vio-sim-es-appointed-chairman-of-the-us-chamber-s-us-korea-business-council). On Friday, May 21st, South Korean President Moon Jae-in met with President Biden where [steps were taken to reinforce economic cooperation between the two countries](https://twitter.com/MOTIEKoreaEng/status/1396060830622384130?s=20). Tellurian quoted the tweet stating “[TellurianLNG ready to support this cooperation 🇺🇸 + 🇰🇷with #USLNG from Driftwood $TELL #LNG](https://twitter.com/TellurianLNG/status/1396127896939515906?s=20)”.

This tweet may be a tease but we all know what they’re trying to tell us.[ South Korea was the top country for US LNG exports in September 2020!](https://twitter.com/lngglobal/status/1328389385872498689?s=20)

What is Tellurian?

Tellurian was founded in 2016 by two industry icons, Charif Souki and Martin Houston. Charif set in motion the first liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from the United States Lower 48 and founded Cheniere Energy. Martin originated the concept of LNG destination flexibility, ensuring that LNG became a commodity. 

Tellurian is currently a debt-free company!

What is LNG?

[Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been cooled down to liquid form for ease and safety of non-pressurized storage or transport. It takes up about 1/600th of the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state. LNG is odorless, colorless, non-toxic, and non-corrosive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_natural_gas).

When LNG is returned to its gaseous state, it is used across the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors for purposes as diverse as heating, cooking, generating electricity, and manufacturing a wide variety of products. LNG is also used as a fuel for heavy-duty and other vehicles.

Who is Charif Souki?

To put it in simple terms…Charif Souki is the Elon Musk of LNG.

Charif co-founded Tellurian and serves as Executive Chairman of the Board. He also founded Cheniere Energy, Inc. in 1996 and served as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President until December 2015. Prior to Cheniere, Charif was an investment banker. He serves on the board of trustees of the American University of Beirut and as a member of the Advisory Board of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Charif received a B.A. from Colgate University and an MBA from Columbia University.

[Charif Souki was the highest-paid CEO in 2013](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2014/04/29/does-cheniere-energys-ceo-really-deserve-142-million-annual-pay/?sh=40567db29c59); this proves that he’s the real deal. Charif Souki was voted out of his position at Cheniere by [Carl Icahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Icahn). Charif Souki was fired because he wanted to expand Cheniere with projects such as Driftwood whereas Carl wanted to spend their cash flows on dividends. Carl Icahn to date has never met Charif Souki in person.

Charif Souki resurrected his Driftwood plans by co-founding Tellurian. 

What is Driftwood?

[Driftwood LNG LLC](http://driftwoodlng.com/), owned by Tellurian Inc., is developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production and export terminal on the west bank of the Calcasieu River, south of Lake Charles, Louisiana. Once complete, the terminal will be able to export up to twenty-seven million, six hundred thousand tonnes of LNG per year to customers worldwide.

Tellurian’s Team

The team at Tellurian together accounts for 75% of the LNG export from the USA today. In 2020; 5281 BCF of Natural Gas was exported from the USA. At current JKM (Asian Market) prices for June 2021, that is equivalent to around $37,508,302,500. At current TTF prices (European Market) prices for June 2021, that is equivalent to around $32,161,290,000. These numbers tell you that the team at Tellurian is no joke and should not be taken lightly. 

The President & CEO of Tellurian, Octávio Simões brings 38 years of impressive energy industry experience to Tellurian’s remarkable infrastructure team. Previously, he was President and CEO of Sempra LNG & Midstream where he was responsible for all LNG and natural gas midstream activities in Sempra’s efforts to develop, build and operate liquefied natural gas (LNG) receipt terminals, liquefaction facilities, natural gas pipelines, and storage facilities. He led the company’s efforts at Cameron LNG, Energia Costa Azul LNG and Port Arthur LNG, where he focused on reliability of deliveries to customers, safety and gas sourcing strategies that assure reliable production of LNG. Octávio has deep relationships in the LNG market and an unmatched tenacity for developing new projects.

Martin Houston the Vice Chairman and Co-founder is also an LNG veteran with nearly 40 years of experience. He’s managed all forms of enterprise in the energy industry, has established a strong external reputation in the international gas business, and is largely credited with being the key architect of BG Group’s world-class LNG business. In recognition of this, in 2011 he was the first recipient of the CWC LNG Executive of the Year award.

Why hasn’t Driftwood started construction yet?

The Driftwood project will cost $27.5 Billion including pipelines. Driftwood will produce 27.6 MTPA of LNG. Tellurian has been looking for Equity partners to help with the funding of Driftwood. Tellurian currently has one equity partner which is TOTAL SE. If FID for Driftwood isn’t reached by June 2021 then TOTAL can choose to back out of their position. If they choose to exit, it won’t be an issue for the company as Charif Souki[ “said building the terminal is no longer dependent on the Total agreement.”](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/051221-tellurian-to-finish-commercialization-of-driftwood-lng-first-phase-in-few-weeks-souki) Tellurian currently has all permits required for Driftwood and Charif Souki confirmed that they are intending on starting basic construction this summer and planning on giving [Bechtel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechtel) the green light to begin full construction early next year.

What’s going on with commercial agreements?

In a [recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhmSef_1eUM) with [Citi Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup), Charif Souki stated that ""We want to finish our commercial agreements, which will happen in the next few weeks,” Souki said the offering has been very popular and, if Tellurian hits its target in the next few weeks, would be oversubscribed.

A [recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbQuICpNTYU) targeting Short Sellers was posted by Tellurian. Charif Souki asked the shorts “What do you think is going to happen when we start announcing some of these long-term commercial agreements that we’ve been working on for so long? This will be an interesting question and we will see how the market reacts when this happens.” - We are the market and it’s our time to react.

Our Friends over at Citadel decided to buy [Puts](https://imgur.com/a/EWrhH4T) for TELL 🤦‍♂️ - How many times do we have to tell them not to mess with us 😤

Is TELL a quick trade or a long-term hold?

Charif Souki has made it [clear](https://youtu.be/kQn-eMCbjaM?t=727) that he is building a business and that TELL is not a trade. If you just want quick profits then this stock is NOT for you! 

Tellurian’s Competition:

Although no one in the US will be able to come up with a business model more profitable than Tellurian’s Driftwood. Qatar in many people’s eyes is seen as a big competitor and one that will destroy all US LNG exports but this is simply just not the case. Countries that import LNG diversify their “LNG portfolio” and will buy from a variety of countries and not just anyone in particular. No matter how profitable Qatar’s LNG plan is; Success is almost inevitable for TELL. Charif Souki personally talked about this and with utmost respect reassures us that Qatar is not a competitor. 

Stock Price📈:

Tellurian themselves have implied that the TELL stock will have a value of $12-$17 at FID! TELL is currently trading for $2.62! In the Citi Interview, Charif Souki said that the stock will have $7 FCF in a couple of years! The multiple for the FCF is decided by the market… but is usually around 10x+!🚀🚀

Institutional Owners: - https://imgur.com/a/ssYRYfP

The top 3 institutional shareholders for Tellurian are State Street Corp, Blackrock INC & Vanguard Group INC! State Street Corp recently disclosed that they added 20,783,999 shares adding to a grand total of 23,481,581 Shares. Blackrock and Vanguard own upwards of 13 million shares each! Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street don’t invest in companies that they don’t believe in. They believe in Tellurian and have proved it with the positions they have. 

Tellurian Ownership Summary:

[https://imgur.com/a/xvrVQmr](https://imgur.com/a/xvrVQmr)

Why am I invested in Tellurian🦍🦍🚀🚀?

I am invested in Tellurian because I believe in the business model and also believe in the team. Charif Souki is a very intelligent man and Tellurian’s weekly “2 minutes with Charif” videos keep investors up to date about what is going on with LNG throughout the world along with the occasional updates about Driftwood. $TELL has been through a lot these past few months but we have been setting high lows and higher highs last week which makes it appear as so we are in the “c” or correction wave according to the [Eliott Wave Theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/elliottwavetheory.asp). The fundamentals of this company haven’t changed and things are only getting better.

TELL Positions-  [https://imgur.com/a/QjvCx4J](https://imgur.com/a/QjvCx4J)

I am long TELL as you can tell by my positions. 

**TL;DR -** Tellurian teased their agreement with South Korea earlier today and TELL is basically in a correction. The announcements of commercial agreements will help the stock reach a fair value. This is not your regular start-up company as the team has a shit ton of experience. With a highly profitable business model along with big connections in the business; Tellurian is lined up for success and is just waiting for the perfect time. Carl Icahn a short seller caused the highly respected Charif Souki to be fired from his own company and shorts are betting against his new company. It’s time to crumble the shorts. It’s time for the bulls to takeover!

696,2021-05-24,pennystocks,"CAPEX Concerns were raised after my original Due Diligence posts on **$PBT** by a few contributors in pennystocks. After originally creating a comment I realized that this comment needed to be its own post since there are a lot of factors to consider. My first 2 posts assume that we are entering a super cycle of commodities and as of Q1 2021 this has been proven by the price of WTI Crude Oil and new worldwide consumption. 

**TLDR Shortcut:** The thesis remains that markets are forward looking at oil price rise above $70 is a technical break indicator with price discovery that we have not seen in over a decade(Summer 2008). The market's bullishness towards commodities recently are reflective of inflation and oil prices specifically are on a major run as COVID exposure worldwide is decreasing. Price target remains of $17-22 through Aug.

Increased drilling costs on the Waddell Ranch properties resulting in a deficiency for the NPI. Capital expenditures for drilling, remedial and maintenance activities on the Waddell Ranch properties during the first quarter of 2021 totaled $9.5. At first glance this seems like an issue but US Shale are tight plays that require consistent drilling and fracking which was not done during the decline on 2016-2020 on the Permian Basin properties. The cumulative NPI deficit is **$7,645,016** for the underlying property (at 75%). The NPI deficit must be recovered from future proceeds of the Waddell Ranch properties prior to any other proceeds being paid to the Trust. Total Oil proceeds for Waddell reached **$12,245,665** for the first quarter of 2021. We have a current amount of unknowns such as new well production but we can make certain assumptions based on the knowledge of shale Oil that new wells have a higher production value and older wells have a declining production value. With the addition of the new wells we should see a large jump in oil production from both properties and we already have an increase in oil prices that are at a price target of $65 which is 11% higher than previous year.

Blackbeard has previously informed the Trustee that the 2021 capital expenditures budget has been approved at $88.6 million (gross) ($32.5 million net to the Trust) for the Waddell Ranch properties. The Trustee has been advised that there were **27 workover wells completed, 8 new wells completed, 8 new wells in progress and 9 workover wells in progress during the three months ended March 31, 2021**. The Waddell Ranch is being targeted for production because of the mass amount of oil rich acreage, pipeline placement, and service company ease of access to keep costs down. Texas Royalty Properties is the only producing acreage for Q1 towards the dividend but will have a declining production value while Waddell Ranch should have a massive increase in production value based on the current drilling activity. Unlike certain areas, the Permian Basin has highly proven well production based on exploration technology where all drills are producing wells thanks to fracturing technology. Also the cost of well service companies are still contributing to a lower cost to produce if you follow major service companies like baker Hughes, Halliburton, Fractech, ect..

At the end of Q1 the average per day output production was:

**Oil** 2,379 on an average price of $58.13(**Current WTI price $64.46**)

**Gas** 10,313 with an average price of $1.60(**Current Gas price $2.90**)

&#x200B;

The net profits/overriding royalty interest in the Waddell Ranch properties is the largest asset of the Trust. The mineral interests in the Waddell Ranch, from which such net royalty interests are carved, vary from 37.5% (Trust net interest) to 50% (Trust net interest) in 78,715 gross (34,205 net) producing acres. A majority of the proved reserves are attributable to six fields: Dune, Sand Hills (Judkins), Sand Hills (McKnight), Sand Hills (Tubb), University-Waddell (Devonian) and Waddell. At December 31, 2020, the Waddell Ranch properties contained 648 gross (221 net) productive oil wells, 109 gross (39 net) productive gas wells and 209 gross (67 net) injection wells. Six major fields on the Waddell Ranch properties account for more than 80% of the total production. In the six fields, there are 12 producing zones ranging in depth from 2,800 to 10,600 feet

**Directly from PBT 10-K**

>The Waddell Ranch properties are mature producing properties, and all of the major oil fields are currently being **waterflooded** for the purpose of **facilitating enhanced recovery.** Proved reserves and estimated future net revenues attributable to the properties are included in the reserve reports summarized below.

Estimated quantities of proved developed reserves of oil and gas as of the dates indicated were as follows (in thousands): 

https://preview.redd.it/smt6yvlgp2171.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e49591410caf24941f74df9984b1549b3ad2515

Average oil and gas prices of $65.56 per barrel and $3.11 per Mcf were used to determine the estimated future net revenues from the Waddell Ranch properties and the Texas Royalty properties, respectively, at December 31, 2018. The question raised by my previous posts is if we enter a commodities super cycle will the price of oil exceed $70 and if it does what is the underlying price of **$PBT** represented. An average price of $70 with a proven production value, not factoring in new drilling, **adds an additional $19.75M($4.44/barrel\*4450k)**. If oil prices enter a more bullish cycle similar to 2008 with reopening being complete and a roaring 20s style spending happens for the next Quarter, we could potentially see an average Oil price of $85 for a short period of time in July/Aug which is my targeted timeline and **adds an additional $86.5M($19.75/barrel \*4450k)**.  

The volume of daily shares has been suppressed for a  year which is the average shown but historically was much higher, which leads me to believe we are still early for the upside. For  example in 2008 when oil went on a large run the daily volume reached  +3M at one point. When price for oil is high and the dividend is fully  restored the average volume was around 400k/day and spikes of +1M with a  trading price of $17-22 or $6.8-8.8M/day.

If you refer to my original post, a good portion of shares are institutional or wrapped in a 1031 through a corporation. I learned  about the 1031 connection through some business associates I have in the  Permian Basin that have done this when selling their real estate and  parking the capital during down turns. I believe this will help keep a  large portion of shares locked up as the price rises since a 1031 is a  process and usually a planned event.",njyxbk,[],0

812,2021-05-24,pennystocks,"Background: For the past few months, PPBT has been trading in a channel of 3.80 to 4.75. The company has 65 million cash on hand and currently sits at a market cap of 80 million, and will be presenting for the first time human phase 1b/2 clinical data on NT219 on 6/4 at the ASCO conference. For now, the presentation will only include monotherapy and combination therapy with cetuximab, but with preclinical humanized mouse data that looks like this: 

https://preview.redd.it/m8swwrp853171.png?width=1567&format=png&auto=webp&s=9950b44d2116f92d04729e869033c04951b88869

And having the drug already cleared as safe in humans via phase 1a, it's a fairly safe bet that the results are going to be pretty good - the above data represents results for human tumors implanted into mice. As it stands NT219 seems to have strong synergistic effects with almost any drug its paired with as it prevents drug-tumor resistance, and is a small molecule that can cross the blood brain barrier, allowing it to potentially be a part of combination therapies for traditionally hard to treat cancers as well, such as neck and brain cancer. Additionally, the lead researcher behind NT219 trials recently got an award from the American Association for Cancer Research roughly a month ago. 

&#x200B;

Technicals: The price currently sits at a price of 4.54 and has a RSI of 60.5, so it may be good to wait for a slightly better entry point - I could see a dip of going to the 4.20s in the next two weeks, but I doubt it will get back to the 3.80s with the upcoming catalyst. The company has an extremely tight share structure of 17.5m and an average float of 300,000, so if it moves it will move fast, likely a single day breakout of over 100% as seen with tickers like SYSX. IMO the smart play here is to open up a small entry position and buy as the dips come, or at the breakout past key resistance at $5.00. Since fundamentally the cash value on hand of the company is around 60m, or \~$3.80 per share, even if everything goes poorly the play has a downside of \~20%. If this starts ripping there will likely be a sell off at \~7 to get in if you're late to the party, but short term price targets of $25 (500m market cap) are fairly realistic given they potentially have IP of a highly versatile best-in-class drug that addresses unmet market needs (head and neck cancer). As a long hold, if this gets past Phase 3 this is easily a $100+ stock (2b market cap). As it stands right now, the value of the drug seems ridiculously undervalued and unpriced in, and once topline data for p1b/2 gets released a major risk factor will be removed for more investors to jump in.

$CAPC is a debt-free penny stock exempt company currently trading on the higher-tier OTCQB markets with audited financials and fully SEC reporting.

During last week's conference call, CEO confirmed that Smart Mirrors will begin shipping in June on Capstone's website and **will be available on Amazon.** The company confirmed that the Smart Mirror will be in big box retailers in second half of 2021. Capstone products currently sell in major retailers like Costco, Home Depot, Walmart, Target and more. It's amazon reviews for it's previous products are 5-stars. They know how to build a quality product that sells.

The number of outstanding shares is just under 50M with the company directors owning nearly half of the shares, leaving a float of 24M. Directors have never sold a share over company's history - zero dilution. In fact they added 400K worth of shares in the last couple of months in the open market with plans to buy another 750K shares through August. This company believes in the product.

This will easily appreciate in value once revenues from Smart Mirror are realized. This company is primed for growth and the corporation is already preparing for possible uplisting to NASDAQ.

Beyond this, the Smart Mirrors are just cool - people want them and the price point for $CAPC mirrors is huge for what it offers. Only $699 starting price means it is affordable for the average person, and you can mirror your phone and engage with the mirror just like you would a tablet or touch-screen PC. I think this product blows $LULU mirror out of the water as far as functionality and price point.
