30,2021-05-19,investing,"How one approach diversification, considering this ?

1. S & P 500 might be in bubble considering current and historical PE
2. USA is still great, probably best country in the world, with many good companies. But USA is challenged by China and in next decades Asia will simple have higher growth of GDP. 
3. USD is world reserve currency and by far most traded currency. However importance of dollar might decrease 

S&P PE ratio is high currently. If it gets bellow 20, I would be exposed more. Probably 70% to 80%. If S&P PE ratio goes to 90 +, i would cut index and buy big cap companies with low PE

However most of world is still garbage. Including China

One way to go around this, is invest in competitive industries abroad, where Americans lost edge.

For example semiconductors in Taiwan and Korea. They profit from China growth, yet is a industry which Chinese will not control in next decade or two. However I wouldn't be comfortable buying whole market index there. Anyway both governments (Korean and Taiwanese) heavily subsidies semiconductors. So bet on whole semiconductor industry, is actually bet on their government too. Their currencies, especially TWD is super stable (look Taiwan forex reserve).

When bet on Japan, i would go for dividend stock index in Japan. Many great, big stable companies with 4 % dividend

And I would consider betting on index in India, cause whole market will raise up crazy in next 30 year.

I still work up my portfolio but roughly idea is:

50% american stocks (market ETF)
15% Taiwanese and Korean semiconductors (ETD for semiconductor)
15 % India (market ETF)
10 % EU (Just 2 companies Airbus, Volkswagen. Again bet on them is betting on EU)
10 % Japan (either dividend index or I would pick 5 dividend stocks)

So I am covered for currencies risk, plus betting on India. As well having mix of ETF and few stocks i personally pick up. And in Japan I cover dividend stocks

63,2021-05-19,investing,"I have a question how to properly calculate Return on Investment (ROI).

The formula is (Unrealized\_Gains + Realized\_Gains + Dividends) / Price

It works fine, but there is one situation when selling stocks and rebuy them. In my example (Buy-Sell-Buy) I assume that I was able to buy stock again at same price I sold it. I didn't use other capital for this, to re-buy the stock I'm using same money. As result it shows 50% ROI even though my initial investment is still 100€ .

I bought it for 100€ the price went up to 200€, I sold it for 200€ (100€ realized gains), I then decided to buy it at same price I sold, so now Price will show as 200€ and realized gains 100€.

Maybe I should calculated ROI at each step - when I buy stock, receive dividend, sell stock and then do some kind of average?

340,2021-05-19,investing,"I have YOLO'd a significant portion of my portfolio into Field Trip Health based on my bullish opinion that Psychedelics are the future of mental health and human brain development.

Here's Why...

Ketamine Therapy - this is the type of therapy that is currently being offered through Field Trip's clinics.

Ketamine is a Psychedelic substance that (when administered in small doses) can lead to a significant shift in consciousness for a person with severe depression. 

Is Ketamine the answer?

No, I don't believe that it's the answer to our increasing levels of depression. That being said I believe it's a great step in the right direction. 

The Gateway to Magic Mushrooms...

Starting early with legal Ketamine therapy is a tremendous strategy for the company. Making the right connections patients and health authorities early on will prove to be a valuable resource in the next phase which is...

Psilocybin Assisted Therapy....

The chemical that's derived from Magic mushrooms has the very powerful ability to cure people of depression and that is already being proven in clinical trials. 

Psilocybin beats Lexapro - https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032994

Where Field Trip Stands on Psilocybin...

It was made clear in a recent interview by co-founder Ronan Levy that he doesn't believe Ketamine is going to be the future of the industry. While there will still be a place for it, he believes that Psilocybin  is likely to surpass Ketamine in terms of overall benefits.

I highly recommend you listen to the interview. It will leave you with a much better understanding of what the company does and where they are headed. 

The full interview - https://youtu.be/8gtyZ8DWwNoq

Growing Revenues...

The main concern with any new startup company, or a new industry for that matter is how will revenues be generated. Field Trip has already proven revenues, which for a company at this stage in the game is impressive to say the least.

They have also managed to increase their revenues each quarter. 

More locations...

The company is planning on building 75 therapy centers over the next few years. Currently they are operating 8 locations, some of which are providing therapy sessions and others that will be soon.

393,2021-05-11,investing,"* Fed policies could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC.
* “I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” the chair and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said.
* Though he agreed with the early steps the Fed took during the pandemic, he said the policies have continued for too long.

Federal Reserve policies aimed at keeping markets and the economy afloat during the pandemic could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC on Tuesday.

The chairman and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said the Fed’s insistence on holding interest rates down and buying trillions in bonds even though markets are thriving and the economy is booming is a long-term risk.

“I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” Druckenmiller said during a”Squawk Box” interview.

Though he does not take issue with the Fed’s initial actions to combat the pandemic-related threats, Druckenmiller said the central bank has kept its foot on the accelerator too long.

He asserted that the Fed has continued its policies to help underwrite the spending binge in Congress, which has allocated more than $5 trillion in stimulus and is contemplating trillions more in infrastructure-related spending.

Over the long haul, he said, the policies and the heavy debts and deficits they support will threaten the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency. That status means the dollar is accepted for transactions and as a store of wealth anywhere and is widely held by central banks around the world.

“If they want to do all this and risk our reserve currency status, risk an asset bubble blowing up, so be it. But I think we ought to at least have a conversation about it,” Druckenmiller said.

“If we’re going to monetize our debt and we’re going to enable more and more of this spending, that’s why I’m worried now for the first time that within 15 years we lose reserve currency status and of course all the unbelievable benefits that have accrued with it,” he added.

To be sure, others have warned in the past that Fed excesses could threaten the dollar, but the greenback has retained its position in the world.

One reason for that is there have been no other viable alternatives introduced.

Druckemiller has entertained the thought that a challenge could come from the crypto world. He said in the CNBC interview that the ultimate solution could be “some kind of ledger system invented by some kids from MIT or Stanford” though he conceded that “I don’t know what it will be.”

However, he noted that in the early days of the pandemic, other foreign governments already voiced their concerns about the dollar by selling Treasurys, the opposite of what normally would happen in a crisis when ultra-safe U.S. debt is generally seen as a haven.

Indeed, foreign holdings of government bills, notes and bonds actually have decreased, falling by $127 billion or nearly 2% over the past year, according to Treasury Department data. Foreigners hold nearly one-third of the public portion of the $28.2 trillion U.S. debt.

Druckenmiller said central banks have been the root of a lack of confidence in dollar stability.

“The problem has been clearly identified. It’s [Fed Chair[ Jerome Powell and the rest of the world’s central bankers,” he said. “There’s a lack of trust.”

Druckenmiller’s comments came a day after he and Duquesne partner Christian Broda said in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal that Powell “needs to recognize the likelihood of future political pressures on the Fed and stop enabling financial and market excesses.”

Similarly, former New York Fed President William Dudley wrote in Bloomberg News that markets are underestimating how much the central bank will have to raise interest rates in the years ahead to keep up with the inflation it is trying to foster.

The Fed itself, in its semiannual Financial Stability Report last week, said it worried about risks coming from soaring asset prices.

Druckenmiller told CNBC he has “no doubt whatsoever that we are in a raging mania in all assets.”

586,2021-05-19,investing,"Throughout the lifecycle of bitcoin, I've heard this statement over and over again. ""Bitcoin is gold for the 21st century""... ""Bitcoin is protection against jpow's printer"".... ""Bitcoin prevents against USD debasement""...

I have nothing against blockchain tech on its own. I think there are some wonderful aspects to the technology. With that said, the amount of narratives used to sell bitcoin to others that are just completely wrong on a variety of levels is getting to be rather stupid. And given today's selloff, it's a good opportunity to explain how the narrative is completely disconnected from reality.

**Bitcoin As Inflation Protection = Bad Narrative**

I have said for a long time that bitcoin is a RISK ASSET. It's yet another in a long line of strong performing financial assets that have done well in our environment of excess liquidity and low inflation. In this light, it's not that different from the growth investing asset class. 

If bitcoin actually served as any form of inflation protection, then why in the world did it tank 12% on the day that we got the highest YOY CPI print in over a decade? And nobody can argue that it was a product of interest rates rising... since they haven't risen in any significant way since that inflation print. And it's now tanked almost 40% at a time when you would expect any idea of inflation protection to be the strongest driver of the asset class. Something... doesn't add up here.

Why make up incorrect beliefs to justify purchasing something, when there are perfectly reasonable bull cases to be made that aren't dependent on misleading people on the economics of inflation and ""money printing""? And for whatever it's worth, Gold suffers from some of the same problems, although it obviously behaves a bit differently than crypto. 

**Bad Economic Narratives Dominate Bitcoin Beliefs**

* How many times do people need to show you M2 charts before they actually take a minute and compare M2 to the actual inflation levels? Hint for those who aren't aware, growth in M2 is 100% meaningless if it causes an equivalent drop in the velocity of money.
* How many times do people need to call quantitative easing ""money printing"", without understanding how quantitative easing actually works? Hint: the ""money printing"" comes from temporary fiscal stimulus, not from the fed pushing reserves that are never used onto banks' balance sheets.
* How many times do people misunderstand that ""asset inflation"" (which is just another word for a bubble) is different than consumer price inflation? Hint: Real consumer price inflation is typically rather negative for more speculative risk assets (such as bitcoin). 
* How many times do people need to suggest the US dollar is ""getting killed"" before they actually look at a price history chart of the US Dollar? Hint: the US dollar is more or less right in the middle of it's price range over the last 50+ years, is significantly higher than it was throughout the entire time period from 2005-2015, and hasn't even dropped that far this year despite the massive amount of stimulus + fed swap lines used since the Covid pandemic.

&#x200B;

My personal subjective opinion is that Bitcoin is yet another risk asset that benefits largely from too much money chasing too few assets. This IS actually in part a product of quantitative easing, but the irony here is that QE is not actually causing inflation. I think blockchain will likely be used in the future for a wide variety of uses, but I have no clue whether Bitcoin will serve any actual functions aside from speculative ownership. Note: I do not own any crypto or crypto-oriented stocks, so I don't have anything to either gain or lose here. 

And by the way, this is not intended as a bullish or bearish post on bitcoin. Just trying to debunk some of the very obviously incorrect narratives that have been sold to the public over the years.",ngamt2,[],0

The new rules apply to “Pink No Information” OTC securities of companies that fail to publicly report and keep current financial and other company information and will restrict the ability of U.S. brokers, like E*TRADE from making these products generally available. 

Some background on the new requirements 

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently adopted amendments to SEC Rule 15c2-11 governing the submission and publication of OTC quotations. These amendments will prohibit broker-dealers from submitting or publicly disseminating bid/ask quotations for OTC securities of issuers that do not meet enhanced information filing requirements. 

Securities of issuers that make the required information publicly available by the deadline in the rule should not be affected.
