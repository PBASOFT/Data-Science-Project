He recently made a number of leadership changes under the strategic direction set by activist investor Ryan Cohen, who is leading his transition to e-commerce to compete with large retailers.  
Former CFO Jim Bell and chief client officer Frank Hamlin were among the senior executives who left this year, and CEO George Sherman is expected to leave on July 31 or when a successor is appointed. Former Amazon Web Services engineering manager Matt Francis was appointed to his newly created position of chief technology officer in February.

His mouth is all over my face, kissing, sucking, licking, biting – GME's ferocious in his attack. His diamond hands mirror his lips, plundering every inch of my skin he can reach, rubbing, moulding, scorching. I reciprocate as hard and as fast as I can, never more grateful that GME tolerates my touch.

GME's lips make it to my ear, nipping and licking me closer to the building orgasm inside of me. 'Jeez, I can’t get enough of you, I can never get e-fucking-nough!' His diamond arms circle my hips, lifting my buttocks, making me feel safe in a sea of his stock shares.

I take the not so subtle hint and band my legs around GME. 'Yes!' I hiss my demand. Without preamble GME fills me with his veiny diamond weiner, pounding hard and I take every thick slide of him drilling me to the slippery tiles, his diamond balls swinging like an ape from a tree."" - Fifty Shades of Abe (Lincoln, 1864, p.110)",['GME'],0

I am currently at $6200 by some miracle thanks to SPY calls and F after being as low as $3500 and as high as $8,000.

If I had just put the whole $6,000 into SPY on Feb 25th I would be at $6,500 and have about 200 hours of my life back from staring at price charts.

I feel like I'm probably just lucky to still have my money, but I actually understand options and the greeks now. Do I stay on the rollercoaster with 3 months of training or just realize it is all a casino, dump it into SPY and do something that actually makes life better for someone?

You don't owe anyone else anything in this regard. Everyone is gambling and you've got a relatively winning hand. If the debt is putting pressure on you, you've gotta make the best decision for yourself right now. I had a certain amount of an animal based online currency - did I sell it when I could clear 2k of debt? You're absolutely fucking right I did. I could've held it and made 5x more, or I could've still been 2k in debt. I'm happy I chose the latter either way.",[],1

My understanding (IANAL) is that a vote to go private would result in a recall of shorted shares and cause them to either hand over their position at a huge loss or they'd try to buy more shares to return and retain control.  Odds are the sellers at that point would demand prices so high the vote would break.

Most good news has very little affect on the market. There would have to be some major big news to get whales back to buying (which is not impossible). If they agree on some bipartisan infrastructure plan that could be the catalyst to make the s&p move to 4300 which is why I think Biden is going to give a speech on it soon. I don’t know for sure it will happen when I say so don’t make bets of my advice because when it comes there will be plenty of time to join in.

It's not a sex convention, but it is an environment where a lot of people go to try to meet potential romantic/sexual partners.

Yes there are social cues, but they are not always obvious. You can't always tell if the girl across the dark/loud bar is smiling at you or just smiling, and sometimes there just isn't an opportunity for eye contact until the person is approached. So people approach and ask to get an actual answer, not a facial expression that they have to interpret.

I can see why being propositioned by someone you're not interested in can be uncomfortable, but I think it's still acceptable in the right context.

Market cap of 3.26 Billion, share price of $47.55 when I'm writing this. It got as high as the 90's before the pandemic book the shins out of the market and dropped it to $28. Since recovered a bit to... as I said $47.55  
  
They have some 🛰️🛰️🛰️ in space that allow people with a 📡 to get internet from space like some kind of awesome scifi movie.... except the internet is 💲💲💲💲💲💲💲💲. Their 🛰️ are pretty high up and that means each one can cover a BIG area. They only seem to have a handful, maybe a dozen? But they offer pretty broad coverage and are expanding it. BUT because the 🛰️ are high up that means that the latency (time between your computer and your internet source or something like that) is high leading to slow speeds and overall not a great service.  
  
They already have airlines as customers, expanding recently with Delta. Their is VERY LITTLE competition in this business and between ✈️✈️✈️ ,🚢🚢🚢 and 🏠🏠🏠 in rural areas with no other option they make a nice amount of money. Totally solid business model. Internet is ever more and more important and usage on ✈️ and 🚢 is only gonna go up.

They also are doing to the aerospace / orbit supply and transport industry what many of us wish Tesla could fully due to the fossil fuel industry. SpaceX's Falcon9 🚀 is all sorts of amazing - mainly because it isn't thrown out after each use. This first stage booster (the bottom part of the 🚀 that you usually see falling back to earth right before they cut to the star of the movie floating in zero g... maybe spinning a toy or something) which costs $40MM comes back down... land safely AND RELIABLY ... some barge floating in the ocean... doesn't matter, point is it works. And it means that SpaceX can launch missions to orbit for the cost of rocket fuel, no need to go buy a $40MM booster, they can just use the one the Airforce bought for a single use mission (our tax dollars hard at work smh).  
  
StarLink is a division of SpaceX that is focused on bringing internet to the whole 🌎 using a crazy amount of 🛰️🛰️🛰️🛰️🛰️🛰️🛰️🛰️🛰️🛰️🛰️🛰️🛰️🛰️🛰️. Like... A LOT. Unlike ViaSat which has a few 🛰️ the StarLink constellation (thats what they call a network of 🛰️🛰️🛰️) has 16 HUNDRED 🛰️ and they are launching 60 at a time every week or so (sometimes more than once a week). Because StarLink has access to this game changing super cheap 🚀 transportation AND Musk is doing is usual weirdness by mass producing these satellites and focusing on cost and volume instead of making them SUPER DUPER reliable (I mean... they are sending hundreds a month at this point and on their way to having tens of thousands) these things are making it off of 🌎 like crazy.  
  
Some of you may remember how TSLA was this tiny company that was prob gonna die etc. etc. and THEN 💥💥 there are Model 3's and Model Y's EVERYWHERE. Well StarLink is gonna have that moment soon. Sometime in the next few months there will suddenly be high-ish speed internet (between 50mbs and 100mbs) literally ANYWHERE on 🌎 for $500 down and $100 a month. The service is SOOOO much better and over the course of a year cheaper than the competition that VSAT is gonna do the second half of a 🚀 flight. They are up there now.... and about to come plummeting toward bankruptcy. Sometime in the next few earnings reports something BAD is gonna pop up in VSAT's numbers. They will suddenly start hemorrhaging customers, first the residential ones as tens of thousands of Beta users get on StarLink and then the big corporate ones as the constellation gets robust enough to handle inflight WiFi for ALL of the ✈️ .",[],0

Never sell anything unless
1. If I hate the stock, no returns, etc. Hold until I break even.
2. If I hate the stock, but a little return, hold until I've made 25%
3. Hold stocks I'm indifferent to until I've cleared 50% profit, then sell enough to cover my initial investment and keep the rest
4. Stocks that I'm making crazy profit: hold until I've reached 1000%, sell 10% to cover initial investment, try to diamond hands as long as possible.

I've got a limit sell for AMC of 25 (of my 50) to sell at 21.70, and another for the rest at $32.55 (for 1500%).

From my understanding the company has to make an offer to all outstanding shareholders, normally around market value, so that no shareholder loses his position in a public traded market without compensation (read: not forced into a private market without being able to sell). Just like a freeze out. 
But you can very well decide not to sell and stay a shareholder in the now private company. 
And as long as there are outstanding shares, there can be shorts. The way I see it, shorts aren’t per se directly entangled into the public/private company decision.
Although it’s a very unlikely scenario, which seems terrible for the short seller, bc the underlying value isn’t displayed in a demand/offer chart like with a publicly traded company.

So my question is this: If AMC explodes as projected because of the MOASS, and I make a king's ransom off my 40 shares, do y'all think we'd have time to invest a sizeable chunk of that right into GME before IT then explodes, and does the same thing? Double dipping and MURDERING the hedge fund dickheads financially, just seems so damn sweet and this would be the nails in their coffins if they got hit twice like this. Thoughts?

If the price of a stock is 20.05 right now, I would put my limit price of buying at 20.10 to hopefully have my limit go off immediately incase the price goes up a wee bit in the meantime. 

This would constitute a BUY.

A sell would be if stock is currently at 20.05 and I want to make sure I sell mine right now (but don't want to use market sale) I would put in 20.00.     That way my trade is executed faster.  That would be a Sell.

1) It's fucking stupid to financially doxx yourself. Yes, you can censor accounts #s and whatnot, but you're still announcing to the world exactly how much money you have and at what bank. It's just a stupid risk to prove to some stranger that you have money.

2) As you said, screenshots are easily doctored, so it wouldn't prove anything anyway.

At the end of the day, you are arguing that you are 100% sure that I don't have $20k, based on nothing, simply because I won a bet. It's just a really stupid hill to die on, for no reason.

I do have $20k, but I've literally never cared about anything less than I care about you believing me. Money is money, even if some weird guy on the internet is shouting that it's not real. I can still spend it.

9637,gzklc9z,2021-05-26,t1_gzkg6gw,wallstreetbets,"No, puts are options that you can buy on a stock. Usually, when a stock's price is high, people buy puts to hedge against the possibility of the stock price to drop. So say you buy a GME put for a strike price of $200 expiring next Friday. That means whoever sold you the put is required to buy GME shares from you for $200 at any point from now until next Friday. If GME's share price remains above $200, then the put you bought is worthless because it wouldn't make sense for you to exercise it. However, if GME's share price drops to, say, $170 by next Friday, you can exercise your put and sell your shares for $200. There are a number of variables and factors that determine the price of the put option, so it may not always be profitable even if the strike price is higher than the share price. It's basically like paying for an insurance policy. If you're new to options though, you should definitely understand what they're about before buying any. It's very, VERY easy to lose money on options.",['GME'],0

9737,gzklkhn,2021-05-26,t1_gzkjmkt,wallstreetbets,"Looks like you bought the $9 strike price 6/18 UWMC call. Right now it’s out of the money so the intrinsic value is -0.40 or so. Once UWMC reaches $9.35, the intrinsic value of your call would be worth 0.0 and any stock price above that is that difference x 100 to your pocket.

However, there are many factors that effect the extrinsic value of your call, namely the greeks delta (chance of reaching strike price), vega (implied volatility), and theta (time left til expiration). I’m oversimplifying the greeks but just know that volatility in the underlying stock increases option value, as does time. If the stock price goes up so does delta. As your call gets close to expiration, you lose time and thus lose theta, they call this theta decay. 

Anyway, since we’re pretty close to 6/18, and since your call was cheap, you probably want to gamble and hope there’s a pump and pseudo squeeze to bring the price to maybe $10+, then you can sell your option for .65+ and maybe even easily 2x your call. With a $9 strike price, with the way things are going I wouldn’t be surprised if you sold for 1.05, a 3x. 

So the stock moves up less than $2 and I 3x my investment? Yes, that’s why wallstreetbetters are addicted to options and also lose money just as fast. I actually had over a 6x on UWMC about 2 weeks ago, buying $10 6/18s for 0.10 and selling for 0.63.",[],0

The company is obscenely overvalued so outside of hoping for a squeeze,  buying right now is a *terrible* idea.

If you're betting on shorts not being able to cover because there's not enough shares, and then AMC introduces a shitload more shares into the market, then it just got easier for them to cover.


And most of all it means that you probably shouldn't be buying right know if you didn't know what that meant. I'm not trying to make fun of you or insult you, after all none of us are born with that knowledge, we all were there at one point.
