49,2021-05-24,StockMarket,"Liquified natural gas, LNG, is one of the world's fastest growing fuel sources. Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

Recently the company became debt free and is in the process of finalizing commercial deals with buyers.  These deals will be announced within a few weeks according to their CEO. 🚀🚀🚀

The time you have waiting for that dollar to grow just feels like you would be better off spending your time for other things. The only video I could find of ""low amount to high amount"" was [right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkvt6FEyCTk&t=447s). Apparently he says he goes from a starting balance of $50 to $2000 and the last video I could find of this was week three, which was [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn3X0RtOXqg). It looks like he's doing calls and options and all that, which to me shows that even $50 dollars would be too slow to make any noticeable gains at all, so he has to resort to doing those, which he ends up going down every week.  


That was the only video I could find of ""low amount to high amount"".. I would like to believe anybody can start in with one dollar, fifty bucks, or hell even 100 bucks and work their way up without putting a single cent in afterwards, as that would be incredible.

533,2021-05-24,StockMarket,"**Introduction**

How to beat the market is one of the hottest topics among investment professionals and retail investors. Beating the market is like winning the NBA championship, it puts a halo on the investor or analyst. During my research, it seems like almost all open sources talk about the ability to pick outperforming stocks as the most important factor in a market-beating strategy. As a finance professional, a former trader at an investment bank, I’m telling you that is not true and there are many other strategies that can help you to beat the market, even if you don’t know how to pick stocks. Moreover, stock-picking isn’t for everybody because it is very time-consuming and requires extensive knowledge in finance. In this article, I will explain the pros and cons for a retail investor to focus on picking stocks and one of the many other methods, I personally use, that can help you to beat the market without picking stocks. 

**How hard is it to beat the market?**

According to Forbes, a study by Vanguard, an American investment company with AUM over 6 trillion dollars, found that only 18% of active mutual fund managers beat their benchmarks over a 15-year period. Of these outperforming managers, 97% of them experienced underperformance for at least 5 years, more than 60% experienced 7 or more years of underperformance, and 66% of these star managers underperformed for 3 or more consecutive years. These managers are highly educated, have many years of experience in the financial markets, working over 10 hours a day, it is very surprising to see only a small fraction of fund managers can beat the market in the long term and this fact also tells us how hard it is to beat the market consistently.

**Why stock-picking is not for everybody?**

First, compare yourself to these active mutual fund managers and ask yourself the following questions: are you smarter than them? Can you work harder than them? Do you have more knowledge about the financial market than them? If most of these managers cannot beat the market, why can you? Stock-picking requires a lot of time and industry knowledge. For an average retail investor, assuming this investor has a full-time job, it is very hard to find the time to learn and perform due diligence in order to screen for potential outperforming stocks unless this investor has 48 hours in a day and gets free RedBulls.

Secondly, diversification can be tough for retail investors who try to pick stocks for their portfolios. If an investor wants to reduce his or her portfolio risk by diversification, he or she will have to sacrifice some returns because risk and expected return generally have a positive relationship. If the investor decides to have more concentrated positions to boost up the return, then his or her portfolio risk will go up as well. For example, imagine you have $10,000 to invest, how many holdings are you going to have in your portfolio? 3 or 10? If you choose to hold only 3 stocks, your portfolio risk is probably through the roof, and you should be ready for it. If you choose to hold 10 stocks, do you have the time and energy to perform due diligence on these 10 companies and follow their every action? My point is, holding single names is not the optimal way to construct portfolios for retail investors who lack time and financial backgrounds.

**What should we do?**

In my opinion, broad-market index ETFs, such as SPY, are better for the kind of investor that I mentioned above. But you might ask, how can you beat the market by buying the market if we assume S&P 500 is our benchmark? The answer is to hold SPY and sell covered calls.

**What is a covered call?**

A covered call is a strategy where an investor sells call options and owns an equivalent amount of the underlying asset. For example, you have 100 shares of SPY and sell 1 contract of SPY call (1 contract = 100 shares).

Let me briefly explain how options are priced. Generally, we can explain option pricing based on the following formula:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a0qatxh7h2171.png?width=392&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fd2e93c18884ea7a5ebbf527cd9747c57bf0021

Don’t be frightened by this giant formula. All you need to know are the factors that impact the price of a call option:

1. Spot price of the stock: the higher the spot price, the higher the price of a call option

2. Strike price: the lower the strike price, the higher the price of the call option

3. Time to maturity: the longer the time to maturity, the higher the price

4. Volatility of the stock: the higher volatility, the higher the price

One thing that we need to pay attention to is when the spot price exceeds the strike price of the call option, our shares get taken away. So, this strategy puts a cap on our potential returns but reduces our portfolio risk at the same time, remember the price of the call falls when the underlying stock falls, and we are shorting the call options meaning we gain when the price of the call falls. Therefore, the key to this strategy is to choose a strike price that can both maximize our return and have a reasonably low probability of getting exceeded. A pay-off diagram for covered call strategy is shown below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/61scxtcch2171.png?width=386&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a6ede26272c416caa1954ffc75eaf1290277de5

**How does the strategy work?**

Let me demonstrate the application of this strategy with a real-life example.

https://preview.redd.it/yivme2jgh2171.png?width=1114&format=png&auto=webp&s=3000096b043c95d11bbd880be9f70d2f888e2805

The above call options expire on January 21, 2022, which is approximately 8 months from now. If we buy 100 shares of SPY at the current spot price, $416.97/share, and sell a call option contract at 10 cents/contract with a strike price of 575, your portfolio return on the day of expiry would be the return on SPY + 10 cents x 100 shares if the spot price of SPY does not go above the strike price.

Choosing the right strike price is the key to this strategy because the strike price has to exceed the amount of management fee charged by SPY and maximize your result. The way I do it is to analyze the following 2 scenarios:

1. Normal stance

The market is in an upward trend and has not experienced any big corrections in the past 12 months. The chart should look like the following. 

https://preview.redd.it/0o5dhbvnh2171.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=649b8a84d7c3297628b6823fdddff87201ebbacc

 In this scenario, I would choose to sell the call option with a strike price that is equal to 10% (annualized return of SPY) plus 5% (I choose 5% as my ‘buffer’ because I would be happy to sell SPY 5% above the annualized return, it can vary based on investor’s expectation), above the current spot price. If we take the current spot price of $416.97 and add 15%, it will give me $479.52 which rounds to $480. The highlighted call option in the image below has a strike price of 480 and expires on June 17, 2022, which is approximately one year from now. The premium for this specific call option is $6.25, which is approximately 1.50% of the current spot price of SPY. 

https://preview.redd.it/vvb9rxirh2171.png?width=1114&format=png&auto=webp&s=768df8085fdc7dcfc4baaf9b7f25a2c2c38d0944

 According to Yahoo Finance, SPY charges an annual management fee of 0.09%. So, we take 1.50% that we earn from selling the call option and minus the 0.09% charged by SPY, then we have 1.41% left. 

*Processing img ewi3y9tth2171...*

 Remember, we still must deduct trading fees charged by the broker in order to calculate the final return. For the broker I use, they charge me $10/trade plus $10/contract, which is $20 in total for this trade. The return that we make from selling this call option is 416.97/share x 100 shares x 1.41% = $587.94. So, in the end, we can make $587.94 - $20 = $567.94, which is 1.36%. So, if the spot price of SPY does not exceed 480 on June 17, 2022, our portfolio will outperform S&P 500 by 1.36% (assume the tracking error of SPY is near 0). Do you think 1.36% is too little? Let me show you how much value an extra 1.36% return can add to your portfolio. 

*Processing img 3fkksgwvh2171...*

https://preview.redd.it/tkuhmfkyh2171.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0514095b47fb57ef3642044ae9ea5ffbf3723f8

2. Recovering stance

The market is recovering from a sharp drop. The chart should look like the following. 

https://preview.redd.it/1biky3a1i2171.png?width=276&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f1490f15ae533d2c3eda55480ba9af72fa5b89a

If this happens, just like in March 2020 when the COVID outbreak started, I will hold my positions and perhaps buy more with the money I made from selling call options previously. If my call options happen to expire during this downturn, I would not roll into new expiries because the strength of rebound is hard to predict. Again, we want to minimize the chance that the spot price goes above the strike price.

**Conclusion**

By using the covered-call strategy on broad-market index ETF like SPY, you will have a higher probability of beating the market than picking stocks and lower your portfolio risk at the same time. The only time that you will underperform the market is when the market is stronger than you expect, meaning the spot price at expiry exceeds the strike price.

But let me be clear, this is not a perfect strategy. As I mentioned above, a risk to this strategy is your potential return being limited by the strike price you choose. Another thing that we need to keep in mind, option prices vary from time to time due to changes to the factors that I mentioned previously. With that being said, the return is not guaranteed.

Hopefully, this article can help you become the ‘market beater’ that you always dream of.

550,2021-05-24,StockMarket,"**Preamble:** The current jump in US consumer prices has understandably spooked investors. The current CPI numbers stand at 4.2 percent which is the highest they have been since Sep 2008 (the increase was almost 4x of what was expected). 

https://preview.redd.it/hbqazq6ek2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=74eadb25a157f0eb06f2fc177ca21eeecf52b40b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?**

https://preview.redd.it/y5euumxfk2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=e50fa2852db7a4ff3c648499fab4149dd23f5187

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let’s be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) – i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/nsplxyohk2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=db044c0fd63d2bf2396e095e5bc306489204a4d4

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/eze2j12jk2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0351d45013eb9bb4be06a43ac2e4ef1254d23088

”Money printer go brrr” was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn’t announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

*Processing img 54n0nmokk2171...*

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed’s explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

717,2021-05-24,StockMarket,"Company Overview

BlackBerry is in the process of transforming itself from a hardware company to a software company. Back in the day, BlackBerry was once a dominating player in the smartphone industry but soon their market share had been taken by Android and iPhone. Since then, the company has been struggling and trying to transform its business strategy to be software-focused. Today, 98% of BlackBerry’s revenue comes from software and services, comparing to only 3% in 2014. During this transformation, their revenue and profits have been declining year over year, its profitability has been shredded into pieces. The company has just released its 2020 results and showed that its revenue and profitability have deteriorated once again, with revenue declined by 14% comparing with the previous year and a loss of $1.97 per share. The market is so bearish on the stock but we think otherwise, this might be the darkest before the dawn.

&#x200B;

QNX

BlackBerry QNX is a real-time operating system (RTOS). RTOS is an operating system that serves real-time applications with real-time data. It’s targeted to solve problems as it goes. The difference between RTOS and traditional OS that we are using daily, such as iPhone IOS, Windows, and Android is that RTOS will not crash if something goes wrong with the system. For example, when the Windows operating system encounters an error, it will shut itself down and gives us a blue screen. If an RTOS runs into the same problem, it will bypass it and won’t shut itself down. This is useful in many applications, such as autonomous driving. Imagine your car’s operating system shuts down while self-driving, the result can be catastrophic. 

The EV market, as we all know, is growing rapidly. According to IHS Markit, the total sales of EV globally is around 2.5 million cars in 2020 and they expect it to grow by 70% in 2021. They also said global sales will top 12.2 million cars in 2025, indicating annual growth of nearly 52% (compounded). By 2021, China and Europe will account for the largest market shares, with China at about 44% and Europe at about 28%. Then North America with 16% and a combined share of 11% for Japan and South Korea. The EV market and autonomous driving technology seem to be growing together, autonomous driving features are more common in EVs than traditional cars. And the amount of effort and money required to develop a reliable operating system is too much, that many automakers will consider adopting an existing platform like the QNX rather than developing their own. With that being said, the user base of the QNX operating system will increase exponentially as the EV market grows.

The QNX operating system doesn’t just work on cars, it can also work on smart home appliances and even smart city infrastructures. As of today, there are more than 175 million cars on roads that use the QNX operating system. 

Ivy

BlackBerry Ivy is a cloud-connected software platform, joined force with Amazon’s AWS, that allows automakers to create personalized experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with QNX and AWS technology. In simple terms, this is a data-collecting platform that collects vehicle and driving data from all cars operating under QNX. This is a very powerful service that can help BlackBerry’s partners make better products and improve sales. BlackBerry’s plan is to roll it out sometime in 2022.

Spark

BlackBerry Spark is a product that utilizes AI, machine learning, and automation to provide improved cyber threat prevention. Cybersecurity is the company’s strength and the market is growing at a high speed. According to Forbes, the global cybersecurity market is currently worth $173 billion in 2020, and growing to $270B by 2026 (7.2% annual growth rate). We expect it to grow faster than 7.2%, given we are more dependent on the internet and computers than ever, and frictions between nations are getting worse. The recent SolarWinds incident has rung the warning bell to all of us, cybersecurity is crucial for every nation, business, and individual.

Sale of Patent

BlackBerry is selling patents that are no longer relevant to them. We think this is a good move by the management. Recycling some of the capital and resources and put it somewhere more productive. The CEO, John Chen, said in the earnings call that they are in talks to sell some of their hardware and wireless network patents to a North American party and the deal is likely to go through in 2021. 

Conclusion

Despite the declining revenue and EPS, we are optimistic about BlackBerry. We need to keep in mind that the company is undergoing a complete transformation, from a hardware focus to a software focus, the management has been great at executing their plan. The company has positioned itself in 2 of the fast-growing industries, EV and cybersecurity, both as industry leaders with good market share. We expect BlackBerry’s growth to pick up in 2022 and onwards.

Our style

We are focusing on long-term investments with a time horizon of 5 years or longer. We care more about future growth potential than current valuations. BlackBerry is a long-term play and we expect it to yield exceptional returns once the transformation is complete.

I've linked the app at the bottom. Any feedback would be great. Also any other ideas for future additions or other portfolio optimization would be great. I am thinking about looking into sparse covariance matrices or rebalancing (backtesting) applications. Anything would be much appreciated.

[Smart Mirror Product Action Shot](https://imgur.com/a/ZNJri3r)

$CAPC is a debt-free penny stock exempt company currently trading on the higher-tier OTCQB markets with audited financials and fully SEC reporting.

During last week's conference call, CEO confirmed that Smart Mirrors will begin shipping in June on Capstone's website and **will be available on Amazon.** The company confirmed that the Smart Mirror will be in big box retailers in second half of 2021. Capstone products currently sell in major retailers like Costco, Home Depot, Walmart, Target and more. It's amazon reviews for it's previous products are 5-stars. They know how to build a quality product that sells.

[Tweet from Capstone Companies, Inc.](https://imgur.com/a/ur3npx5)

The number of outstanding shares is just under 50M with the company directors owning nearly half of the shares, leaving a float of 24M. Directors have never sold a share over company's history - zero dilution. In fact they added 400K worth of shares in the last couple of months in the open market with plans to buy another 750K shares through August. This company believes in the product.

This will easily appreciate in value once revenues from Smart Mirror are realized. This company is primed for growth and the corporation is already preparing for possible uplisting to NASDAQ.

Beyond this, the Smart Mirrors are just cool - people want them and the price point for $CAPC mirrors is huge for what it offers. Only $699 starting price means it is affordable for the average person, and you can mirror your phone and engage with the mirror just like you would a tablet or touch-screen PC. I think this product blows $LULU mirror out of the water as far as functionality and price point.

848,2021-05-24,StockMarket,"I've bought a bit of Bitcoin back in 2013 and 2018 and sold a % during this bull run. My plan is to DCA those profits but with a couple of rules. I'm a swing trader and it sounds good to me, but it might be a dumb idea from an investing point of view.

\- I plan on buying $100 every Sunday (worst performing day for BTC).

\- I will only buy below the 50MA. If price on a given Sunday is above, then I will rollover those $100 to the next Sunday, or until price goes under the 50MA.

\- I'll buy $200 instead of $100 if the price is below the 200MA by 25%.

\- I'll buy $400 isntead of $100 if the price is below the 200MA by 50%. I've found that BTC's deepest dips are around that price level.

Is this a dumb idea?",nk37cq,[],0
972,2021-05-24,StockMarket,"The point is that senior employees of public companies are required to make their transactions public. It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I’ve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is top 5 by insider selling activity.

**So, top 5 companies by insider buying activity for the last month:**

I will post the second list with the top 5 companies by insider selling activity later in a separate post, if you like this topic.

I entrust the analysis of the reasons for such peaks in insider activity to commentators - some are quite obvious, others are not.
