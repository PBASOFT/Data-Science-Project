Take SPCE right?

High of ~60 or so ... Recently traded as low as 13 due to failed or cancelled tests...

Successful test this week.

The ""community"" such that is, is very divided on puts and calls ..

The stock is back up to ~21... but also still has many open shorts and puts  .... So...

1. Was a successful test ""priced in"" and now we'll see profit taking and a reduction as people who are up 30% exit rapidly to new buyers?

2. Was the market divided on possible success, thus, now knowing it was successful for sure, will price increase again now that uncertainty has been removed?

3. What is the actual fundamental valuation of the company? How the fuck do you even calculate that for speculative tech growth? What is the ""premium"" SPCE has for still being ahead in the commercialization of ""space tourism?""

4. Will SPCE flounder because Blue Origin and SpaceX offer superior products? Does the potential for earthbound hypersonic low-space flight make a difference to the revenue streams of SPCE?

&nbsp;

So you have dozens of people arguing this point... And it really just comes down to you to finish up the research and make a decision.

SeekingAlpha's catalyst watch has some commentary on some of those tickers...

**Monday**

> Options trading is implying significant volatility with Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) and Build-A-Bear Workship (NYSE:BBW) ahead of their earnings report. Both stocks have seen big reactions on earnings release dates in the past.

RIDE comes as no surprise  ... BBW has been on a huge tear recently... I'm guessing downturn even on a mild beat as people get scared and take profits here? A big beat will probably see more FOMO though.

I have a strangle out on RIDE and might take a strangle out on BBW (down biased, puts ATM, cheaper calls), assuming this one is going to end up being seen as overvalued.

**Wednesday premarket**

> Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) holds a conference call following the release of Q1 earnings. Morgan Stanley thinks the retailer will boost full-year guidance, perhaps by a significant amount. Shares of Dick's have turned higher during past conference calls when execs highlighted demand trends.

Morgan Stanley suggests this will be a big winner, but again, major retail has already surged... That said, Target (TGT) continued to surge higher after an excellent report as well last week. Options are pricey so a ➰ might be a tough pill, although if you go with ATM calls and cheap OTM puts as a deep hedge, you might be okay?

**Friday (premarket)**

> DXC Technology (NYSE:DXC) reports earnings with a track record of beating revenue estimates in four of the last five quarters and EPS estimates in 11 of the last 12 quarters. 

The same article suggests going long on an associated 
microcap instead, which derives most of it's revenue from DXC, but well, OTC microcap so no ban plz.",['RIDE'],1

You do realize that there is zero chance that there will be more votes then there are shares outstanding?    

Voting is controlled by DTCC, they know where every real share is and people without real shares (e.g. people whose shares have been borrowed by a short seller) do not get to vote.

Recently had an ape try to go on about synthetic shares to me before I started questioning it because I know “synthetic shares” is actually a options strategy that mimics the performance of buying shares with a lower capital requirement, but they aren’t really “fake shares” at all, right? 

Because if you had a synthetic long position and a short position you’d basically offset both sides and be left with minimal to no gains, and if the short puts expire in the money you’d get assigned the shares which would offset the short sale and you’d be left with no position, but what the fuck are the GameStop folks going on about?

Also, look at some of the financials for Big 5. Compare some of their numbers to DKS. They have a super low P/E still, half of what DKS has, and lower than ASO. Zero debt moving forward. I don't see another week like they had after earnings but I still think they'll outperform ASO and DKS through the summer. I'm also biased because I have shares and grew up going to Big 5.

This happens because the short sellers have a certain amount of padding / extra days to deliver shares; during which both the original shareholder (who did not agree to loan the share out yet) and the short-sold-to shareholder (who purchased from the open market) have voting rights!

Using the forms of analysis we are similarities in big market moves can be found over 100 years of trading. Happening today in all different markets and present in the historical markets of times before us. If these things continue to happen, these strategies will be successful. If the market becomes different from how it has always been, then these will not work.  
  
I use these strategies to trade daily and they are currently still working. If they do not work over 1 hour, day or week I am not concerned but if there was a consecutive three months I could not get anything to work, I'd seriously reconsider if I wanted to be in trading anymore. But for now, they continue to work as per my experience.

Alternatively, QQQ is more targeted towards growth (which recently has been technology) and in addition to containing more _unprofitable_ ""growth"" companies, has a larger % allocated to these companies, and is less diversified.

(Who's gonna use that trash LMAO) So my sister saw me do that. She got angry at me like what the hell? So as the train came up to the platform I pushed her in front of it.

I am now faced with charge of murder, like wtf she got what she deserved. I am now posting this from her funeral laughing my ass off.

Was I the asshole? I don't think I did wrong neither do my friends and 4 million instagram followers. This is just a waste of time smh...

Like in python an if statement looks like

if *condition*:
  Expression
In Javascript or c# an if statement would look like
If(condition)

  Expression
}

The syntax in this case is the brackets and the semi colon, and goes to reserves keywords, and how compilers work with whitespace.

You can learn a ton by yourself, online courses, YouTube stack overflow.  My advice if you're looking to get a job without the CS degree, don't get intimated at all, build a portfolio on github (or some source control website), use smaller projects, code a lot like dedicate an hour+ a day to it and learning how things work.

If you think you'd learn better in a structured setting like a college that'd an option too.

In response to your #4 point - RKT posted over 2 billion in Net income with over a 200% increase YOY. Thats where you find it. Look at how that stock is turning out.

Figure out whether you’re posting a value play or a short squeeze play because it’s definitely not both. A short squeeze is the only way it’s going to go up and for that reason only I’m considering a position for like a day. Afterwards, it will trade sideways for eight months because it’s new to the market and that’s what happens. Then it’s gonna tank down to $3 a share because no one gives a shit about mortgage company in a rising rate environment. Although most retail here is still bag holding because they read this post and actually we’re motivated to buy a bit too late.  

Anyone with a brain isn’t investing in RKT because of mortgage origination revenue so you posted a mortgage company long term play here then this is truly retreated. If you actually compare the reports you’re essentially comparing apples to oranges. If you remember, you’re actually only on this sub because the company piggybacked off of RKTs publicity during the squeeze in March.

3783,gz81dc9,2021-05-24,t1_gz7uxll,wallstreetbets,"Sure thing- open interest is the amount of contracts bought/sold. So for OPs strike price and date there have been almost 1500 bought/sold.

As far as the bid/ask spread. For 1/23 950 call highest bid is 23.45 and lowest ask is 28.30 (these are prices from market close Friday so obviously that will change at market open tomorrow and during regular trading hours it is constantly moving)

So. Say you buy a contract, lowest ask is 28.30 so it will cost you $2,830 for a contract, BUT since the highest bid is only $23.45 it’s already $485 in the hole (if you wanted to sell right away) 28.30-23.45= 4.85 x 100 shares per contract is $485.

Now that’s extremes for bid/ask. Obviously if you put in a limit sell order and your offer is the lowest ask, it will be sold above the highest bid price. So usually with selling you can get a price somewhere in the middle. But, increases in IV or stock price is going to make the value of the option go up which is what OP will need to get his option back in the green because right after buying the option it is automatically worth less than he payed",[],0

Absolute rocket fuel, in my opinion. My cost average is around $9 for 1000 shares from the original COVID crash, and I have 15 $30 6/4c. I’ve held my shares for over a year through all of the ups and downs because I know the hype from Branson flying will be unlike anything we’ve ever seen before.

The online gambling market isn’t about getting all of the current gamblers.  It’s about turning those unlikely to step foot in a casino into part time gamblers from the comfort of their home.  Whoever has the best tech will provide the best long-term value.  Think Facebook, DoorDash, Amazon or Twitter....those companies changed our habits by being great at building something easy, enjoyable and infused with AI so it knows what you want to do before you know what you want to do.  That’s the bet here.  If you want to pretend you’re exposed to online gambling you can convince yourself MGM , PENN and WYNN are the plays but what you’re really doing is fooling yourself because you don’t like the risk that comes with something new and unprofitable like DKNG.  The only thing that makes me pause is the price to sales ratio of DKNG.  BUT if the short-term premium for no debt is 20x-35x then pay attention to forward revenue and buy the fucking dips kids.

  Selling off the loans lowers their risk.... that seems good to me if your income model is on origination fees and servicing only low risk loans.   I saw that Rocket lowered their guidance, while UWM increased their forward earnings guidance at last earnings call.  I get that there is a big feud between the companies and im not trying to pick sides, just make some $.  I agree that originations will likely play a bigger role for all mortgage companies going forward (compared to refi)  as rates increase and inventory stabilizes.

 I also agree that middle-men draw profit out of the transaction, so ideally eliminating them would improve efficiency for the customers long term (but since when has saving money for a customer been the priority.)  Car companies dont seem to be in a rush to sell direct to consumer, even though im sure most of us would prefer to just pay the price of a car instead of have to haggle- and it would likely increase profit to the car makers. (Tesla was smart to do direct sale but plenty of people still buy Ford through a broker).  
I wouldn't want to be a mortgage broker just starting out as it is a potentially disruptable market, but i see that happening well after the millenials begin to retire and the boomers have all passed away (they seem to really like haggling).  For the next 10 years though i like UWM's profits as a wholesaler, and i like their dividend.

5021,gz85hvg,2021-05-24,t3_njgs1i,wallstreetbets,"I agree with this post and thank you for being kind enough to alert others to this start-up American EV company’s success story in the making. It is truly exciting what is about to unfold. I have never invested in a pre-revenueI company until now.  This company’s licensed tech of in-wheel motors is awesome and gives them a real competitive advantage. 

For all those reading through the comments on this post you will see some negative ones here and there (I’m not referring to doubters or those with legit questions).  Most of the time it is clear by their statements they did NOT read all the available DD and they lack knowing the full story, or are taking all the information released by Hindenburg as true (eg, “CEO is a conman”,” ex employee says production is 3 to 4 years away and other defamatory or false or misleading statements), or seeing lawsuits arise due to pre-order language used (even though pasted across the tv screen in the 2020 cnbc Interview of the CEO by Cramer it stated “50,000 non-binding production reservations”). 

So, I am not a bagholder friends. And frankly, I don’t need your help at all to pump the stock price over my cost basis. On the contrary, I am a very serious independent, individual investor who owns tens of thousands of shares of one heck of a company and I plan to stay with them as long as the story remains intact—and that could be for years.  What IF LMC ends up producing not only the Endurance, but vans (as about to be announced), eRVs (see Marcus Lemonis and Electric World), and even  skateboards for other Mfrs — and combined, ends up at several hundred thousand units per year?  I’m not looking to double my money this year with a SP in the $30+’s.  If one really understands what’s going on, it is a much longer term hold with “a “multiples” potential. 

You don’t have to BET anything. Just read the DD, listen to the earnings call Monday, and if production is still scheduled for around end of Sept 2021 (actually, anytime this year) and if tens of Betas have already been produced, and if there are 10,000 to 20,000 binding orders placed already — then consider INVESTING in this incredible start-up (that owns a high dollar former GM auto plant).  It may be one of your best investments ever.  Again, I highly recommend you read the available DD.

Unless a competitor of LMC, or a Big Oil 
company fearful of a faster transition to EVs, one has to ask oneself:  why would any American citizen not want this American EV start-up to succeed: with its innovative in-wheel motor technology, its goal to bring back at least 1,500 jobs to Ohio, its goal to be part of “Voltage Valley” (EV innovation located in Mahoning valley)?

Keep in mind, even with regard to Short Sellers, they really want LMC to succeed now AFTER they have made money shorting the stock due to taking advantage of this pre-revenue company’s vulnerabilities.  Now they likely want to buy in at low prices and reap the harvest when the company’s production and game plan takes off. 

I WHOLEHEARTEDLY RIDE WITH $RIDE!  If and when you are ready, I welcome your company.  Again, it is Super Exciting!  All the best.

It needs to capture market share, it doesn't need to capture the whole fucking market. if it only sells 200k trucks to Ford's 600k the only one who would consider that a failure would be you and the shorts. As for production, the plant was producing 600k Cruzes at its peak. And that's a vehicle with a full drive train, exhaust, fuel system etc.  The Endurance has about 1/4 of that to install. 

As for pricing.  Ford. Fucking. Lied.  The truck *starts* at 39.9k.  That's without the extended range package, the towing package, and all the little extras that you would need to pay for to get a vehicle with comparable specs to the Endurance.  And that's if you could find a base model Lightning for sale.  According to Ford, the F150 LT starts at 28.9k.  Know anyone who paid less than 40k for a new F150?  Fuck, when I tried to order one with base specs, it quoted me a price of 35k.  Im sure somewhere there's a 2021 F150 selling for under 30k.  But it aint to you, me or damn near anyone who isn't in on that scam.

As for the bagholders being between 8-30.  That's a hell of a fucking spread buddy.  If it hits 30 over the next two weeks, that's a 200% gain.

One night she told me she’d be taking next week off, so she could go meet her fiancees family. The craziest part of the story, is that her fiancée was an Amish guy who she met while working. She said as soon as he walked into the strip club he walked right over to her and told her she was the most beautiful creature he’d ever seen and they’d been together ever since. She was so nervous about meeting his family, she had to buy new outfits that covered her from the neck down because nothing she owned was modest enough. I guess my point is that if some Amish Chad isn’t afraid to introduce his black stripper girlfriend to his entire family, what the fuck is holding you back from living the life you want to live? Get out there and fuck shit up this week.

Sure, but I'm not sure that TSLA going down another %10 is, _by itself_, going to drive SPY lower by a considerable amount.

If you sell an at the money put while it's on the way down you'll have a lower cost basis than if you bought stock  at the same moment you sold the put. Ie you sell a 6 dollar strike price put for 0.30 premium you're actually buying the stock for 5.70 vs buying it at the 5.80-6.00 that it's trading at the time of selling your put. Now obviously it can tank further before the expiration but you weren't planning on waiting that long to begin with so you'd be holding the bag either way. And if it went up instead? Well you still get to pocket your 30 cents per share so if it only went up to 6.20 you actually ended up ahead without even having to own the stock.,[],0

In after market SPY $415.46, now if you (or your broker) needs to buy 100 SPY for assignment they need to buy it from market. Based on the Friday AH price you need $(415.46-415.00)\*100 = $45 above the strike price of $415 to deliver those shares to the put writer, don't worry $415/share will be paid by the put writer, you just need whatever obove that $415 is. That $45 is the loss one broker was showing based on AH price. 

When you wrote this comment US 500 future was up by 0.33%. Based on that current theoretical SPY price is 414.94 + (414.94\*0.0033) = $416.3. Now if your broker needs to buy SPY for assignment, they (ultimately you) need to pay $1.3\*100 = $130 more. This was the reason you were seeing $125 or $105 loss. 

If SPY gap up tomorrow by whatever amount your loss will be that gap up difference times 100. Which means opening at $420 and your theoretical loss of $500.

1.  There is a big push to write software which does the job of a broker at a fraction of the price.  Enter your info into a software package, upload your house’s title, HOI and tax docs and it’ll match that against the AUS (automated underwriting system) that tells lenders whether a loan is eligible for sale to Fannie or Freddie and boom you can see what lender would give you the best rate at that set of criteria.

I wanted to post here for a few times about RIDE but got rejected by bots. I hope more people can look into this Tesla2.0 .

The sales of Pickup truck in Q4 2020 surpassed Sedans for the first time in US. EV Pickup truck is the future warzone of EV, not supercars, not low cost EVs for your grandma.

Ford spent millions of PR fund on the unveal of F150 Lightning and invited the president to test drive. You can consider it as a candidate of Democrats.

Endurance also got the blessings of GOP. Donald Trump and Pence help promoted Endurance of RIDE while they are still leading the country back to prosperity.

No matter how the county's economy grow under Biden's adminstration, EV Pickup trucks will still be a focus of the country. Fleets especially need a lower running cost and maintenance cost during economy recovery so you can run your business more efficiently than your competitors. And if economy goes down because of Biden' administration, fleet managers will also need a lower running cost more than before.",[],0

Meanwhile, I overheard staff mention that all resort inventory is completely booked for the next two weeks solid - not a single room available on property - and that they are having trouble both hiring and ramping people up. There was also speculation on the issue of lack of specialized knowledge surrounding furloughed pyrotechnicians, and some practice events they were doing late at night to get warmed back up.

As for masks, the guests are beginning to flagrantly disregard the rules and many of the staff clearly don’t enjoy the role of “enforcer”, making cynical comments about taking last breaths of freedom before heading indoors.

7765,gz8fbjh,2021-05-24,t1_gz8d3eh,wallstreetbets,"Let me tell you why I will buy puts. 

The Theory of Robinhood and WallStreetBets.

• When people see something on WSB and they read all this dd, the first thing they might do, is buy, and chances are they will buy on RH as they are the dominant player in the retail WSB apes. 

• When you buy on RH, you are on a Margin Account which means you don't technically own the stock. You basically have an 'IOU' from RH and they take your money. 

• RH's goal is to fuck you out of your money. This means, if 10,000 people buy SPCE, they will take 10,000 and short. If they short and can drive the price down, of those 10,000 people who own IOU's half of them will sell back their IOU at the new short price (let's say 50%). This means RH just made 50% FREE MONEY on you AND they made money on the short & rebuy. So it's a win-win because retail sells and cries. They never really purchased SPCE, they just gave you an IOU for those shares. 

• So, when 10,000 apes drop 1,000,000 in cash, here is what happens. Due to ""payment for order flow"", Citadel sees that a million dollars of buys are coming. Price is $38. So, Citadel jumps that line, buying 1M also. So Citadel buys at $38, driving the price to $39, and retail buys drive the price at $39, pushing it to $40. This happens so fast, that retail doesn't get why they bought in at $38 but really paid $39. Then, Citadel sells at $40, making a $2 profit in SECONDS. and the price, literally SECONDS after you buy, at $39, which pushes it to $40, now drops back to $39 and sometimes even less. So you buy after Citadel buys and when you sell, you also sell after citadel, so you get fucked twice. You could hypothetically Buy at what you think is $38, and it processes at $39, and then the second later you sell, you think you are selling at $39 but because you are now BEHIND citadel in the sell too, you are selling at $38, effectively costing you to pay more, and sell less causing you to lose $1 within a second. But that doesn't really happen, so instead, they short. Shorting makes you sell because you panic, and they win. 

So, the news doesn't matter.

The only thing that matters is how much people from WSB buy. The more they buy, the more you bet against.",['SPCE'],0

This is what's been going on in Japan for quite some time and has led to a sort of eternal downward spiral for the buying power of it's citizens.

8632,gz8i287,2021-05-24,t1_gz8gfdw,wallstreetbets,"Really this question is for a different subreddit.

Options have several different components. Both intrinsic value and extrinsic value. The intrinsic is easy: for puts greater of zero or strike price minus the underlying price. In this case 300 * (415 - 332.69) = 24,693. 

The extrinsic is a bit more complicated (mostly theta (time), a risk probability factor, and IV; commonly known as Greeks). Remember how you paid $55 upfront for something that had zero intrinsic value at the time? You’re paying for the extrinsic value. Let’s say SPY dropped 20% 4 days after you purchased your put contact. Because IV shot way up, there is still a lot of time left on your contract, and the probability that this contact will finish in the money gained immensely, the value of the contract is worth more than simply exercising.

So go learn your Greeks, learn about option pricing, and leave this place and never return until you are ready to lose a lot of money.",[],0

If you're expecting IV inflation, longer options with low IV at the point of entry may do better. Since theta and IV are separate factors, you get the theta boost on top of the IV spike.

At one point I believe these 950C were trading around $130/share (January/Feb), two years before expiration and with the stock trading under half of the strike.

To oversimplify, the price of a call option is dictated by how likely an option is going to be above the strike price and by how much...

So the price of OP's option can go up simply by the market deciding that before January 2023 there has been an increase in the chance of GME exceeding $950 than the day OP bought the option.

--- 

And going back to your question, even though GME is at $176 today, the option expiry isnt for almost 2 more years... so that is plenty of time for anything crazy to happen. BUT as we approach the expiry date, then the option value will start to reflect what you stated... the difference between share price and strike price.

A squeeze is a catalyst, but not all catalysts are squeezes. Like say a stock has zero short interest, but announces out of nowhere they've secured a 500 billion dollar contract with the US government and that news drives their stock price into the stratosphere. That news is a catalyst, but not a squeeze. That's an extreme example, but I hope it illustrates the point: any event with potential to move the price is a catalyst. A squeeze is one such event, but far from the only one.

This is part of the problem imo, and why squeezes get brought up in UWMC threads. Ever since the GME squeeze happened, it's like a lot of people have internalized the false belief that the only way a stock price ever moves up is with a squeeze. I suspect it's novice traders fomoing into the market trying to catch the next GME, or possibly idiots, or possibly people straight up lying to try to pump whatever stock they're currently bagholding. I'm not saying that you are one of those, or accusing you of anything...but those are the angles on this I have seen before. UWMC is certainly not the only stock I've followed with people clamoring nonstop and nonsensically about a squeeze; it's all over the place ever since GME happened.

But for what it's worth I do agree: UWMC is not a squeeze play. It could happen, but that ""could"" is million-to-one odds...and that's bad. However, it is a long-term value play with rock solid fundamentals that I suspect has an upward price-correction coming as it becomes more established vis-à-vis trading on the market. And even if it takes a while to price-correct, in the meantime I collect dividends and premiums on covered calls. Long players will do well here if they really know how to play long.",['GME'],0
