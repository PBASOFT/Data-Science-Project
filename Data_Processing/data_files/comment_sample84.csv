A common misconception that science continues at the same pace. You can't just ""*buy*"" inventions. You can't ""order"" a new technology that hasn't yet been invented. The last century was a great leap in innovation, all the electronics and computers and all other great things. But we may have reached a plateau - it may be temporary, it may be long term, but it's obvious to everyone who isn't afraid to open their eyes that the speed of innovation has slowed down considerably. Not to mention all the headwinds to our growth in the form of falling EROI and all the ecological problems.

Thats a big problem because it means the only way to grow is by either lowering cost or raising prices. This is not easy.  

Also despite AMD flashing good tech, they were never able to penetrate enterprise in the past. Athlon had major thermal issues. This time they did. In fact they are a big player in servers today. I find that my servers on GC running Ryzen outperform their Xeon counterparts dollar for dollar. This is bad news for Intel because their position in enterprise was thought to be unshakable.

Dont get me wrong, I think Intel can do a lot of things to get back on track. All I am saying is when investing, you should wait to see the plan first. There is really no rush. Its not like they are going to magically find new market share to grow exponentially in the next 5 years.",[],0

When a stock issues a dividend the market usually arbitrages the stock price lower by the dividend amount.

They’re well positioned to meet the impending rise in demand for battery grade lithium carbonate in terms of their Argentinian project. Production will begin in 2022, they have a partnership with Gangfeng for a large amount of the product (70%) to be bought at market price insuring the company will have a off supply. Gangfeng just made moves to open a lithium battery operation in the same town as the Argentina mine. LAC other operation is a bit more tenuous in terms of funding (they still need a major partner) but they have gotten a groundbreaking environmental document. I work in environmental regulations, the ROD they got for Thacker Pass puts them in a trajectory to meet the upcoming demand in 5-10 years. 

The lower price point should make it an easy stock to pick up, I’ll bet you’ll see a rise this year when they obtain their water rights and land rights for Thacker pass and in quarter one of 2022 when they announce production in Argentina. 

I’ve spent a good amount of time researching LAC, the lithium market, mining techniques as well as my background in environmental regulations.

no it isn't.  
  
>real unemployment is sky high  
  
What're you using for ""real unemployment""? U-6? Currently, U-6, which measures underemployment, is 10.4% and trending downwards. That's...where it was in 2015? And above 10.4% from July '08 until June '15. We've been above that for nearly an entire decade before.  
   
>stock valuations are completely bonkers trading several more times forward earnings than we historically have seen  
   
Huh? For some stocks, sure. Recent IPOs and memes like TSLA. But, could it simply be that companies are doing well? For example, nearly every one of the top 10 companies in the SP500 posted absolute monster years in 2020, record profits and revenue.   
   
> The market likes predictability, of which there is almost none present nowadays.  
  
The [VIX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EVIX/) exists to measure volatility, and while it's up 11% today, it's still down from a 52 week high of 36. Not like this is something we haven't seen.  
    
>it is a completely fair take to not see any end in sight  
  
You should take a deep breath and go outside, and I'm being honest. The CDC just removed the mask mandate for vaccinated persons. Unemployment is falling. Inflation, as of now, is exactly what we've expected. A short, transitory rise, followed by a flattening. We're in that rise right now, and it's not ""out of control"". We haven't even looked at raising interest rates as an option because we aren't concerned yet.  
   
There is absolutely an end in sight, this is a wild thing to say as a result of *checks notes* a 4% drop in the sp500 since an all-time high we literally hit on May 7 (which was just 12 days ago!!)

* Estimate how many people will buy a FSD subscription if the software is truly autonomous and allows individuals and companies to deploy their Teslas as robotaxis for almost 1/10th the price of Uber/Lyft
* Multiply that number by $400 (conservative estimate for what an FSD subscription would cost when the software is perfect)
* Multiply that number by 12 for annual revenue
* Multiply that number by 0.9 for operating margins (almost pure margins)
* Multiply that number by 0.8 to get Net Income
* Multiply that number by a realistic PE multiple to get the Market Cap by 2030

Once full autonomy and robotaxis become reality, it will be a $4-8T market opportunity. Part of Tesla's valuation is the believe that they will capture a large part of this market. If they don't manage that, I do agree that it will take a while for them to start generating a return vs the current stock price.

That said, they still have a serious opportunity to generate high margin software sales even if they don't solve full autonomy. For example, they already make about $1000-1500 per car from software sales and they haven't even launched their app store yet. Meanwhile VW is spending billions to build a software system that delayed the ID3 release and then forced them to recall all ID3s because of more software issues, while it's earning them $0.

As for their production growth, they've already secured the factories to grow to 3-5 million cars per year and they're doing it at a much lower cost per installed production capacity than other automakers. There's still some opportunity just in their production expertise. Things like the way their factories are built, their material scientists, stamping presses, etc.",[],0

433,gypwp5p,2021-05-19,t1_gyp6xbk,stocks,"Sort of a lazy analysis that seems to be too effected by your personal consumer opinions. Don't make investing choices on your consumer tastes. I buy from failing retailers all the time and I invest in stores with a good strategy that I'd never use.

The retail market, besides adjusting to E-commerce competitors, is also adjusting to shifting changes in income distribution int he country. Long term, we live in a society where 25-30% of society has more wealth than in the past and the bottom 70% has stagnant or wealth decreases.

This means retail markets are forced to adjust one way or another. They have to attract higher tier, but fewer shoppers (fewer locations) or they have to attract attract masses that are more budget conscious. 

They never made a large of a move into grocery super centers, as Wal-Mart did. However, they have made a large move into clothing, on top of their existing home goods. They've created a line up that is less like Wal-Mart, but competes better with cheaper clothes retails, such as Kohl's.

This is important, because they can grab market share from that 70% that can no longer afford to go to a typical Mall-based anchor or a specialty clothing store. However, they have to create better clothes and brand identities to attract them. This means they have some traction doing that.

That is partly why Mall chains and anchors, except for a few, have done so poorly. The business model is dependent on a stronger middle and lower-middle class. While e-commerce is certainly played a larger role, there are spots in the market for some retailers to take market share from others failing to adjust or unable to adjust to the new market.

&#x200B;

This same effect is why Bed Bath & Beyond is struggling, but higher tier stores with fewer locations, like Williams Sonoma are doing well. On the lower 70% of the market, Wal-Mart, Target, and Amazon are able to take market share from stores that use to cater in the middle of these two different price tiers.",[],0

They also have an email API (revenue from that grows by 30% a year) and people have been saying the same thing about email going away for 20 years. But you are missing the broader strategy, they are using their own infrastructure to fund the buildout of applications that will eventually provide a wholistic solution for enterprise companies. Flex uses all of their messaging APIs to bring support center infrastructure into the cloud. My prediction is that they will build or buy a CRM to facilitate sales communication with users. And to tie it all together they have Segment which will bring all of your communication data and usage data into a single warehouse.

I don't believe Biden himself is to blame as stimulus was also passed under Trump.  The Dems have done more, yeah, but the Republican plan of ""every man for himself"" isn't really the way either IMO.

The problem IMO is deeply structural (inequality, etc.) and the pandemic just brought that out.  Trying to fix it by throwing buckets of money at it without much rhyme or reason, and with questionable political motives, IMO was not the solution.

Ignoring it for questionable political motives wouldn't have been either.

I don't believe the doomsayers saying we're headed for Weimar Republic---that's a bit extreme and if it were the case, we're sort of screwed no matter what we do. No point to brood over that remote idea.

As far as blame is concerned, to place it on any one person is short-sighted. Keep in mind that a majority of the COVID stimulus, if one wanted to point to that as the impetus for excess inflation, was rolled out by the *previous* administration. And, keep in mind also, that no one at the time seemed to have a problem with it, because we were dealing with the type of crisis that we haven't confronted in over a century. Assigning blame is silly and ignores the fact that the position we find ourselves in is a hole we've dug since the 2000's.

606,gyq3kl0,2021-05-19,t1_gypet2d,stocks,"> they would have a car that can drive itself. No reason to buy any other car. 

We have people that don't want to trust a vaccine in the middle of a deadly pandemic. Tons of people are afraid of flying, even thought statistically it's far safer than driving. People want to feel in control, people don't trust technology (especially with their lives), and people especially don't want to trust stuff like AI, we have an entire movie subgenera dedicated to the idea of AI/robots rebelling and killing people. 

Aside from plenty of totally reasonable reasons to not buy a Tesla (can't afford a new car, want a feature Tesla doesn't offer, just prefer manual driving, want to access areas not well serviced by Tesla's charging network, want to take long road trips that would be hindered by Tesla's slow charge speeds, brand loyalty to other manufacturers, etc.) there are tons of less reasonable/rational reasons that people will be against autonomous driving because people are not rational creatures. 

>Even after other companies solve autonomy, there would still be some brand loyalty to Telsa, much like the brand loyalty to Apple.

Most people who are going to give their brand loyalty to a car brand already have, and the kind of deep running auto brand loyalty that is out there isn't going to be swayed to Tesla by getting FSD a few years before everyone else. Apple's brand loyalty isn't predicated on doing something first, it's predicated on the fact that Apple consistently produces products that merit it. Tesla has definitely generated some strong brand loyalty for itself over the past few years, but most people either don't hold strong brand loyalties, are already have a car brand that they're loyal too. 

>They might launch a robotaxi network. If they cannot scale fast enough they could lease the autonomous driving software to other companies as SaaS.

Which would still require Tesla's hardware, which in this scenario isn't being produced fast enough. Also, while SaaS is great for a company's bottom line, as a consumer it's a gross practice. I would never buy a vehicle that tries to exploit my wallet further through SaaS or subscription models, and I'll never understand why Tesla fanboys are so excited about this from a consumer perspective. 

>There is also there energy product, insurance, battery technology, and artificial intelligence innovations, which could have big potential.

All of which are predicated on Tesla's success with cars. 

>They have the most data, so they will probably be first to solve it

That's not how AI advancements work. Data is one component, but there is so much more. I keep seeing this line parroted around, but it simply isn't the case. There's no doubt that Tesla is *one of* the industry leaders in this area, but they aren't alone and their moat isn't as big as most people think. 

>The stock price has been so high recently because a lot of people are betting that they will solve it within 5 years.

If the bet is that we will have fully working FSD tech being relatively accessible in all 50 states with no more regulatory hurdles to clear by 2025 (seeing as Tesla's price took off in 2020), I wouldn't touch those odds with someone else's money. 


I'm not trying to shit too hard on Tesla here, I think they're an exciting company with a ton of future potential. However, many posts about Tesla's future are like this, where they hand wave away a lot of valid concerns, casually make assumptions that they probably shouldn't, and tend to seriously overstate Tesla's moat while underestimating their competition and the complexity of the problems that they're trying to solve, and just in general being overly optimistic to an unreasonable degree.","['AAPL', 'TSLA', 'AI']",0

All in all, the tech sector, due to its success the last 20 years, has attracted a bunch of imbecile wannabes with their heads up their rears and fraudsters who constantly lie and cheat and they have indeed fooled investors especially the young (sadly). So yea, ""tech"" is over priced right now if you look at averages sector wide. 

And because the sector is hot, they pushed good companies to overpriced territory too including Apple, MSFT, GOOG, Oracle, etc. I might make an exception for AMZN and we can also say that MSFT is fair due to safety but for the most part. We can also say stuff like NFLX, FB, QCOM, CSCO and a few others are probably fair priced.

I am building a div part of my ISA to hold long, but I'm just not sure what to make of it, sure I can get 7% dividend, but that's no good if the shares are worthless (unless I have massive piles of money, which I don't 🤔).

890,gyqc6eo,2021-05-19,t3_ngcedr,stocks,"It's called ""buy the rumor, sell the news""; helped by insider trading.

Home improvement stocks have been rising for a while. Week after week of bull run up to the second earnings. This happened because people were expecting them to smash earnings. So when the news came that they did, profits were taken because in place of high expectations, there's no further momentum.

The hedge funds & institutional investors know that - they realize that reporting earnings is like blowing your load, all that excitement gets released & then the stock goes flat because people don't have anything to look forward to until the next earnings. This is why there's always a run up before earnings - or a run down when the expectation is the other way. It's about momentum.

But the trick is that, *because they know a profit taking is coming*, they're going to try and get out before other investors do. Buy low, sell high, right? That's what everyone's trying to do. Yet because everyone's trying to do it, it becomes a classic game theory problem. If you sell at the top first, you win. If the other guy sells at the top first, he wins. But if you sell too early, you lose. Same goes for him. So how do you ensure you sell first but not too early? Answer is - well, the answer is complicated because it involves all sorts of advanced mathematics involving Nash equilibrium equations, min-max optimization, etc. 

But at the end of the day, how it appears to your random retail trader who's got a college degree at best is that it seems totally random, or that it's all manipulated.

Leading up to Dotcom and housing bubbles I had many friends investing all over the map some won and some lost.

I lost on the dotcom and learned - value and somewhat growth invested after that and did not really even feel the housing bubble (income sure did! but not investments). Took the downturn as a chance to double down on many stocks I already owned for years.

Honestly plan on doing the same again with the next bubble - did it last year with a small amount during March/Covid - still holding some CCL and DAL.

As other have said long term investment/planning - these short term moves may not make since all the time (mainly I believe because we do not look far enough out)

Specifically to Lowes - Lumber appears it might be hitting a bubble (futures off 27% from highes); housing starts are way off due to high costs; Inflation concerns might lead to an interest rate hike - all of which leads to less spending on building materials going forward. SO while they had a report the future is looking pretty sketchy. 

ALSO keep in mind a lot of HD/Lowes spending is from people stuck at home last year. The money that was spent last year on renovations will be moved back to paying for travel and many are expecting it to be a big swing to travel to the point of taking the renovation businesses to point lower than pre-pandemic. 

As for the other companies you listed - sorry none of them would even be on my radar to invest in - call me to conservative - just too many good solid companies (long term) to look at.

That's simply not the case anymore.  Keystone XL is dead and Trans Mountain is in some very long term construction delays that means it won't be operational for at least a couple more years.

Their financials are top tier with very conservative estimates for their earnings for next quarter. They've knocking it out of the park every quarter.

With more people transitioning to working from home, their sales will probably continue to rise.

Concerning Lowes: A lot of time, investors will take profit on good news, and the price will come down temporarily. Also, the earnings (backwards looking) might mean a lot less than future guidance. The price of Loews has run up from 66 to 188 since the height of the pandemic. Sure enough, guidance from the CEO has made many investors question whether such strong sales trends can continue for Lowes as we exit the pandemic and labor costs increase.

I don't know why the other stocks have made runs, but there might be an answer. The answer might have to do with something technical, or a broader segment trend. At any rate, despite what people tell you, the market is not based on fundamentals. Fundamentals are a part of the equation, but if every stock was fairly priced all the time, there would never be any big gainers or losers. Think of it this way: There aren't enough analysts on earth to price every equity fairly based on fundamentals. They simply don't know. That's why all of the ""tech"" stocks get put into one basket and traded together, even though all of the tech stocks are different.

Many new investors simply don't even know what valuations are, since they've been fed growth and hype since they started investing. 

A company can kill earnings and still be overvalued, a company can double earnings and still be overvalued  – just because a company is worth 100USD today doesn't mean it's worth 200USD tomorrow if it doubles its business.

It's brutally simple. The market is forward looking and unless something comes in like a curveball out of the blue; it's also pretty efficient  most of the time. That earnings beat has been priced in months ago. That new product has been priced in months ago. That sector rotation was priced in months ago. Once those new financials are confirmed, the smart money has already moved on, the people who gambled to squeeze the last few dollars are dumping, and only the people who never bother to look at other numbers than share price are holding the bag – only to sell low later and the cycle begins anew.

You can absolutely make good deals, but you do it when companies are out of favour and cheap, or, you buy the rumor and sell before the news. Other than that, longterm investing in solid companies and holding through ups and downs is the only way to go.",[],1

Basically, the market is a sham, and it always has been — and especially since the pandemic, it is totally detached from reality.
