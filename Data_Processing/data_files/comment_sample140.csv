The stock market is facing the same problem. Why put money where it loses value? This is where it gets scary: the stock market is already at ATH levels and has been seeing insane gains. It‚Äôs not merely a stock market problem, but an ECONOMIC one. 

This happened because the inflation rate spiked and is still poised to go up. The S&P however is skittish due to already Low IR and the many indicators of a major correction coming soon (eg ATH margin debt). This combo resulted in the large decrease in inflation-adjusted gains. There‚Äôs not much they can do to curb either.

I've been in the stock market for quite some time now and have a decent understanding of how things work. Crypto currencies are something I've only begun researching and investing in this year. As with all things im life, with time I will learn more and understand these coins for their uses and real world applications. As for the butt hurt thing well let's just say I wasn't offended. I was just shocked that people still had this snarky, I know better than you attitude towards others still. I came to reddit for the subs on the market because I feel have come as far as I can at the moment and am interested in new opportunities and the varying points of view on positions I am contemplating especially when doing research about new investments. But the point is I am not offended, I am a just a little taken back by the reluctance to help and the quickness with which you jumped on me . I am here to learn and help and will always do my best to help where I can. And I think that's the difference between us. I think we all have something to learn from one another and that we should respect each other for what we can offer the community.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

They make money off my money market account ( where you money is held before buying anything)

If they are making anything of my trades or I creasing price it is at least 6 decimals back

Maybe if you learn a little more about it you can tell me exactly how they are making the money ( hell you can give me the page and I'll read it myself to ) until then it seems like you really don't care you just don't like the idea of these accounts ( idk maybe you see it as a handout or something or maybe you can't grasp that they can give a little and receive more with other products ) this is how online trading is going now though maybe not permanently but for one you have all the Information if you take the time to look

Besides crying and asking a lot of questions, what are you doing for yourself? Have you read any books?  Have you googled how to screen stocks?  Do you know the different types of stocks?  Do you have an interest in options, forex, futures? You don't? How do you know?

Have you opened a forex account and used the Mt4 platform with a chart you saw on Youtube? Spent 10 hrs on that chart to understand why it will or won't work?  Do you know what the term 'screen time' really means when it comes to trading?  Because that one, that one's gonna hurt son. You will lose friendships because of that one.  Do you know about support and resistance, divergences, etc?

Awe screw it. Let me tell you why someone would tell you to just buy crypto...because crypto has been trending then exploding! And now it's correcting and doing a pullback, which smart people take advantage of.  You can also buy in when it's trending, it's that simple.

361,gz984oh,2021-05-24,t1_gz81m84,StockMarket,"Fully agree except for the method. Most whales know each other and most whales have a set strategy that is used. I am not claiming in a certain recent short squeeze attempt that the big whales in there heavily sold stocks to each other back and forth to drive down the price, but considering Kramer talked about this as effective tactic back in 2006 to drive down a price and that the Flash Crash was caused by a similar action (spamming thousands of sell orders per second to make it seem like a huge sell off and adjusting them several times a second) also fits into this.

If you are a whale on anything you will sooner or later get into a group that will strategize on what to do. And no whale sells off 50% of their holding, this would panic crash the market. Whales hold usually 40-60% of a crypto market (combined). Instead you drip sell your position, starting really small at 0.5-1% and work your way up. That's why it's so effective to follow wallet transactions of certain whales. The moment this starts and continues for several days, get the hell out.

You've fallen for just about all of the dumbest arguments from uninformed crypto critics. I've already listed out some of the use cases (trustless peer to peer transfers, hedge against inflation, security, transparency, simplicity, ease of use etc) and you go to the ""it's utterly useless except for criminals and thieves"" trope. \*facepalm\*. Do you realize when the internet first came out, luddites such as yourself argued that its only useful for scammers and pedos? I guarantee these same people are using the internet these days. I suppose cars are bad too, because they allow rapists to get around and do their deed and quickly get away. I guess roads are bad too, because they enable the cartel's transfer and distribution of drugs. Guess what, the majority terrorism, money laundering, and other illicit activities are funded by USD and facilitated through banks. So when are you going to stop using USD and the internet?

Invoking the great depression as the argument FOR government backed fiscal policy? Wow, now I've heard everything. Failures of the central bank and the government's interventionist policies are exactly what BTC goes against. People who had money in the stock market and banks lost everything.

I am about the biggest proponent of automation out there. Hell, I even started a blog about it years ago. I don‚Äôt believe for 1 second that tech automation takes away jobs. Quite the opposite is true.

Crypto is not even remotely comparable. It is not this revolutionary tech you proclaim it to be. It‚Äôs only true redeeming quality is in immediate transfers of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù (something actual currencies will be doing in the near future, and practically already do to a large extent) yet it‚Äôs not a currency and would never hold up as one. It‚Äôs too instable thanks to a foolish design of capped supply. Being divisible is irrelevant. What matters is that limited supply with a growing population and growing economies will mean price instability. Who the fuck wants an economy where your monthly wages can only buy a burger the following year?? And again, currencies are created by governments, not individuals in their garages.

‚Äúhedge against inflation‚Äù - it is FAR too volatile to ever succeed at this, and it lacks any true inherent value or government backing.

‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù - tell that to the people who lost all their bitcoin after they lost a harddrive, had their account hacked, etc. At least my bank account is FDIC insured and my credit cards can be contested when some thief uses my account. If you had crypto, you‚Äôre fucked. You can‚Äôt proclaim that it‚Äôs both private/anonymous and secure. If nobody knows whose ‚Äúmoney‚Äù it actually is, then once it‚Äôs lost or stolen, you‚Äôre screwed.

‚ÄúTransparency‚Äù??? Nobody knows who owns what bitcoin. This is why criminals love it! That‚Äôs the opposite of transparency.

‚ÄúSimplicity, ease of use‚Äù - horseshit. My dollars are faaaar easier to use. Atms at every corner. Apps to transfer money anywhere at any time. Usable at any store vs <.1% of stores with crypto. It‚Äôs not even compatable: dollars are faaar more simple to use.

My argument was NOT that because criminals and thieves use them, it must be bad. My argument is that the only actual added utility for such is for criminals and thieves. Everyone else already has normal currency, which criminals can‚Äôt use so easily since it IS actually transparent. Terrorists often used things like diamonds and had to go through tons of difficult money laundering to succeed in transfering money. With crypto, it has been made far too easy to bypass the law.

if you do want to trade or invest in crypto then do some reading, watch some videos, maybe take some notes and understand the market, know what you‚Äôre investing in. and if you only have $25 to start with then that‚Äôs better than nothing so great but just so you know you‚Äôre not really gonna make much money at all with that amount. currently prices for btc and eth (while they are dipping, they) are still extremely high in price and trading volume. this makes every other coin kinda follow their lead for the most part. and if you want to trade newer, cheap coins so you can buy a ton of them in hopes that they blow up and you can see massive returns instead of 20% on a huge day you could be seeing hundreds of % or thousands if you get in early enough. BUT the catch is with every swap between exchanges or coin and any transaction there‚Äôs a fee or gas which can make this very expensive. gas is sometimes up to $70, sometimes even higher, sometimes as low as $5 i‚Äôd say it‚Äôs usually under $20. so you have to be spending a few hundred for it to really count. but if you put $15 into bitcoin which is around $35,000, your money isn‚Äôt going to move much. it‚Äôll have to spike to $70k for you to get $30. and that‚Äôs unrealistic. if you have say $100 in $ELON or something and it goes from .0000001 to .0000004 then you‚Äôd have 400.

""Most likely"" based on what? Any legitimate brokerage will have access to all of the shares their customers own and they won't co-mingle them with their own investments. When a brokerage goes bankrupt, they lose their own assets, not their customers.

The SIPC only comes into play when the brokerage is doing something illegal, like the case with Bernie Madoff which has been the biggest one handled by the SIPC by far.

You also need to realize that the $500k limit isn't the highest limit (some brokerages pay for higher limits) and that the $500k pays for shortfalls in what the brokerage owes you. So for example if you have $5M in assets at a brokerage that fails and they are able to return 90% of that (which is common), then the $500k will make you whole at $5M again.

I highly recommend reading through an SIPC annual report to get a better idea of how they work. You seem to be misunderstanding a lot of it.

You can look in my history if it makes you feel better, but I was paraphrasing in the line you quoted. My first share was purchased for 60 dollars and I made the mistake of selling it for 40 thinking that I had missed the boat. 

I bought back in at 120 and have never been in the negative since then except for like 5 minutes on some random day. 

Anyway, I can tell you are only going to cherry pick lines to look for a gotcha moment. 

The fact is you either believe it will go up or down or you don‚Äôt know. If you believe it will go down, please put money where your mouth is and open a short position against it. I don‚Äôt recommend it as the potential loss is unlimited. If you believe it will go up, having 1 share on hand for any price and then buying the dips would not be a bad idea.

842,gzal2yn,2021-05-24,t1_gzaac56,StockMarket,"Lmao, I've been trading for years. THese terms are heard a lot because they're relevant right now. Treasuries are going negative, RevRepo rates are zero, yet we're seeing higher values than the bottom of the RonaCrash, and that points to a need for securities to generate more free-flowing capital, but I digress.  


Here is the longer, but easier-to-follow breakdown.  


>If SI is over 100% of the float and retail just keeps buying and holding, then it will inverse the market when there is a sell-off.

When you short, you borrow the share. you pay a fixed interest based on a floating share price. this is amortized daily, but the mechanics quickly become too wordy for a comment, so I'll keep it simple. This is also different than the official SI term. (Short interest is the overall term for outstanding shorts of a particular security.)  


You then sell the share, and you have capital.

Let's keep it simple. $10 share price, 10% annual interest.  


Since you'll be paying $1 annually, you want the capital you generated to make money so you are ideally net profitable without any movement in the share price. Usually, shorters play in the market, so the usual place is to pump it into the market.  


Still keeping it simple: Say you earn 20% interest in the market, because you invested in FRO last year.  


Summary so far:  
1. Borrow  
2. Interest agreed of 10%  
3. Sell to short (+$10)  
4. Buy $FRO with short capital (-$10)  
5. Earn Interest on $FRO of 20% (+$2)  
6. Pay short interest agreed in step 2 (-$1)  


The shorter's account currently sits at +$1, but also owns $FRO which is +$10 for a total of +$11. The owed short is sitting at -$10, so the shorter is in the green and is good.  


My first point of the selloff is if retail doesn't sell and the stock rises, the shorters are in the red, and some will be forced to close. If the stock doubles in price to $20, the shorter's 'account' is sitting at -$9, which is where margin comes into play. The shorter must keep their broker happy with enough cash/securities (based on the broker's terms). -$9 is under 50% margin utilization, which is usually okay. trouble starts if the stock increases by another 50%. At $30, the account is sitting at $-19, which is near to 100$ margin utilization. The shorter will receive a margin call which is: 'A.) Deposit cash, B.) Close your margin, or C.) We will close the margin for you and we don't give a fuck what we pay, because we hand you the bill.  


If you are closing a short portion for the short stock at $30, the money you put in the market will come out, PLUS more. this means $30 out of the market, which translates to a net decrease in the overall market (average stocks like FRO), \*BUT\* the shorted stock goes up because the shares are being purchased at market prices, therefore driving buying pressure, and driving it higher.

>  
When shorts finally close there positions, GME will fly even further, and money will be pulled out of the market to close the short positions.  


  
Margin calls have already likely happened/been happening because we're seeing massive selloffs. The S&P500 inflation-adjusted yield has fallen below zero, which happened in previous crashes ('08, .com, '87, etc.) It has set a 40-year low. the only issue? \*WHERE IS THE CRASH?\* My main belief is shorters on GME are selling to maintain margin requirements.  


If the shorted stock drops to $5, then the shorter makes more money. If the company gets delisted, the shorter pays no taxes, so \*effectively\* the shorter can make money two or three ways (depending on your view:)  
1. The initial sale of the security.  
2. The net interest gained  
3. The initial tax bill no longer needs to be paid. (Corpo tax rate of 2020 is 21%. which is a ton of extra cash.)  


NOW: There are rules in the United States:   
1. You \*must\* have a ""reasonable assumption of share locatability"" to be able to short a stock, aka 'I think I can find a share'. This rule is true for large players.   
2. Retail shorters must locate a stock before the short.  
3. Market makers are allowed to create synthetic shorts for liquidity reasons. (creating a synthetic allows the market to exist in a more steady fashion. THink like CSGO skins when someone buys a bunk on Buff.) When this operates properly, it is helpful. These shorts have a timeframe in which to be closed upon since they are only there to steady the market.   
4. Short interest can be an official \*MAXIMUM\* of 140%. This rule does not exist in the UK (Lehman took advantage of this in the years leading up to 2008 by transferring the assets to a UK-based subsidiary, and selling MBS over and over, which is called rehypothecation.)  


The issue with rule 4 is that SI numbers are self-reported and what happens when the large players bump over the number? Well, the average penalty for lying is a $1 fine per short lied about. It normally is a solid fine, as most companies being heavily shorted are in danger of being delisted. the $1 fine is proportional to the cost of the security.  


If there is more ownership than should be, then there are naked short positions. Retail ownership is holding steady based on On-Base Volume. OBV is a solid indicator of net ownership, and GME's OBV isn't reflecting the wild price swings. Regardless of the movement, it isn't dropping like it should, which is indicative of more short positions.

Let's take x as money value and y as product value.

The standard value is x = y, so a set amount of money can buy you a set amount of products. When inflation happens prices go up and value of currency goes down, these are not separated, they describe the same thing.

So e.g. 2x = y means you need twice the amount of money to buy the same product. The only way to portray that in real life is by increasing the price, which the 2x reflects. So saying prices doubled or saying the value of the currency halfed means exactly the same thing, though ultimately as a consumer the real point of contact you will have with that is the doubling in prices.

Technically speaking there are multiple reasons for inflation - and while it's definitely true that demand/supply play a major role (for goods), this only tells half a story. Inflation by overprinting is the core meaning of inflation, that is what you usually talk about when you talk about currency. If that happens your currency will give less currency from other countries, while also less goods. On the other side, demand & supply in your region will give you less goods, but still the same amount of foreign currency.
