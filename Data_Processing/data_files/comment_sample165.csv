7,gyqgegp,2021-05-19,t1_gyqbgvh,investing,"Not to be blunt, but that’s a pretty... threadbare “model”.

Seems like inflation in lumber and other commodities has been far higher than “inflation” in stock prices over the last year, are you implying that only “rich people” spend money on *wood*?

Valuations in stocks are high because of expectations of future growth compared to other alternatives, that’s not what inflation *means*. In fact, forward PEs have *fallen* in recent months, almost 10% over the last year as reality catches up with expectations of a rebound/reopening, so recently investors are paying *less* for each dollar of expected earnings, not more!  

Furthermore, inflation is a general effect while the highest stock prices are concentrated among a few firms... look at the gap between forward PE on S&P 500 vs S&P 500 - FAAMG, it is specific stocks with high flying expectations driving the highest valuations already, not an “inflationary” general increase. 

General stock valuations are still higher *than average*, but that’s because earnings yield naturally goes down when the yield on other assets like bonds falls... there is a relatively fixed equity risk premium people need to be paid to hold stocks over bonds, but if bonds are only yielding 2%, but stocks have an earnings yield of 6% (PE 16.5), it’s only natural that people pile in to get better yield/risk characteristics until stock prices rise to depress the earnings yield to something closer to say, 4% (PE 25). That’s not inflation, it’s just a rebalancing of where assets are being stored based on risk/reward.",[],0

The problem is people complain about inflation when it increases but not when there's deflation.

Las Vegas is a classic example that is still underwater from the 2006 bubble. Places like Miami and San Diego have barely recovered, so in some sense there are markets that may have increased a lot over the past year but in the long run have barely budged.

Moreover, the reason house prices aren't included in CPI is because if I buy a home in 2005, I'm paying that mortgage on 2005 prices. And when I sell in 2021, I get to claim all the gains that go with house prices inflating.

Because of this and the level of the position I'm entering, I'm required to integrate my brokerage accounts with their tracking system and BM/WF are not supported.  
So in short, I need to move all my ETF investments to a new home. Bit I have no idea what I'm doing...  
Vanguard is on the list of supported brokerages, and from the research I've done that seems like a pretty good option (also open to other suggestions), but I'm a little confused about:  
Is it possible to move these investments into Vanguard/somewhere else without paying fees or liquidating/reinvesting (which would trigger a rather large and taxable realized gain...) ? How?  
What to do with them once they are there? Not sure what kind of account in Vanguard I should be looking at for future investments. I'm pretty amateur at this and not looking to put a ton of effort in. I just want something basic I can throw money into when I'm able and treat as a long term investment that will give me a balanced portfolio with an average return and charges me a low fee for that service. Right now I'm charged .25% of my overall amount invested and I'd like to keep that number if possible. Do I need a managed portfolio? Does Vanguard offer something simple?  
Assuming I can move my existing ETFs over, do I need to worry about liquidating the non-Vanguard ones and consolidating? Or should I not worry about that? If that is something I should be doing, how do I go about that? (again, I don't want to realize gain that will be taxable)

Cheers to the people that bought it a long time ago, but to everyone who jumped on in the last few months, I sincerely hope you only invested money that you could do without for a while, and didn't crank up your exposure too high.

Before today I was about 7% crypto. Occassionally, there's been a few extremely speculative trades, which is why 10% of that balance is in DOGE, but otherwise I have BTC and ETH. And more importantly, I have no need to pull that money out and just accumulate a little more through regular scheduled purchases. And I only do that after all my other regular investment contributions (work retirement plan, ordinary investment account) occur.

>It's the largest detention of an ethic/minority group since the Holocaust.

No, it isn't. The vast majority of Uighur people are not behind bars. Even by the BBC's own admission, individuals in re-education/vocational camps let people go home on weekends. Comparing this to the Holocaust is perverse. They are quite literally more humane than the american prison system.

This is just a way of America washing its hands of its own complicity in the Holocaust and also in recent genocides and ethnic cleansings in, inter alia, Indonesia, South Korea, Israel, Bangladesh, South Africa, within the USA itself, and basically every Latin American country.

It might not be an inflation hedge value in the US, but it’s certainly an inflation hedge in other companies.  For some it’s a sense of belonging to a community the memes.  For others it’s a collectible and a piece of digital history. Other view it as a doomsday asset. Some people don’t even care about Bitcoin, but they think block change technology is “revolutionary”.  It’s not any one thing it’s true identity is unknown, and dependent on what resources we continue directed towards it.  If everyone said BtC is crap and no one put another ounce of effort into making it better or attempting to unlock its potential then yeah it would be crap and worthless.  However if a lot of Human Resources are made to use it, make it better, and give it an identity it will be valuable.


I’m not 100% confident in this comparison, but think of tangible things like Uranium.  It was discovered in 1789 it had some cool aspects but no one knew if it would be useful.  Then in 1896 we realized we could isolate it and it had radioactive properties very cool and interesting, but no one knew it’s potential.  Then around the 1940s we discovered nuclear power and we could use it to derive plutonium.

Long story short is BTC is in its relatively early stages.  Anyone who says they know what it is or isn’t is full of shit.  It will become whatever humanity can make it or agree on it to be.  Right now it’s just a cool thing with a cool story and some uniquely cool properties.",[],1

The thing is that the censorship resistance and privacy doesn’t really matter when you just use bitcoin as a retirement fund that you declare very transaction on to the government and all the bitcoin you own is kyc’d... bitcoin only make sense when its users are actively adversarial to the existing financial system

Anyways, I think crypto has suffered a lot in the past year because 99.9% of people buying it now are just broke, desperate, and financially illiterate people who want internet funny money to save their life.

This means that as it continues to scale, it will definitely outpace inflation (and most other assets) but this by no means makes it a good ""hedge against inflation"" or ""store of value"", because it is simply to speculative and frothy at this point in it's development to have meaningfully proved itself to be either.

If you own a cash flow asset, you own the cash flows. It means you can reinvest the cash flows. Even if cash flows don't increase, you can reinvest the cash flows into the asset to generate compound returns. In this case, your compound annual rate of return will be the cash flow yield which is cash per year divided by price of investment.

It turns out that your return (assuming no noise which corresponds to the earnings yield or equivalently PE changing) will be 

return = cash flow yield + growth. (in real terms)

The 10% annual returns from reinvestment into SP500 can be seen as follows.

Using historical estimates (and have to average because things fluctuate):

Real growth rate = 2%

Inflation = 2%

SP500 returns = 10%

Since

return = earnings yield + real growth rate in earnings + inflation

If we use the historical numbers, we get

10% = earnings yield + 2% + 2%

1. QE might have lead to inflation if the economy wasn't already in deflation. If the money wasn't used to shore up the assets for bad banks, diluted dollars might eventually find their way into the wider economy. Inflation won't increase while the velocity of money is low. Keith Hennesey, Bush's economic advisor, explains that better than I can.
2. Inflation can be created from more than one source, not just CPI. If the government literally ""prints money"" to pay its debts (like what happened in the seventies) that will increase inflation by injecting cash with diluted value into financial markets. 
3. The law of large numbers applies, I don't think people understand the scale of Bitcoin relative to the US economy. Bitcoin has been used as a hedge against inflation during several other country's inflationary crises, but that's because as you mentioned, its a currency that doesn't move relative to national currencies just like gold. Those countries are much smaller relative to the size of the Bitcoin market than the U.S. economy is.

It was as low as $3000 when lockdowns were first announced. In that regard, it has been a 10x return year-over-year if you bought at that point. See? Cherry-picking dates is not useful.

I mean, I was providing it as an ***example.*** It's certainly not proof by itself, but the broader argument and point is that Bitcoin does not have any noteworthy history of correlation with inflation. Even if you were to believe that Bitcoin is an asset that discounts future inflation, there isn't any strong lag effect in correlation here. 

The thing is, I can create a pretty reasonable proxy for forward looking inflation rate of change by using a basket of other commodities. Yet I can't do this in any reasonable way for Bitcoin. 

Thus, the point isn't that Bitcoin hasn't gone up, or that we haven't had inflation. That's not the point I'm making. I'm just suggesting that Bitcoin is not either correlated with or against inflation, and thus is not an inflation hedge despite so many people suggesting otherwise.

>Try buying a house today with a salary unchanged from 2019. Things haven't kept up with inflation. They'll tell you there's no inflation until you're only eating rice and beans, living in a van.  


Dude, I'm not suggesting there is no inflation. I've suggested many times on here quite the opposite, please look at my post history if you're not sure. What I'm suggesting is that Bitcoin is not inflation-correlated. I'm also suggesting that the majority of the inflation we are seeing ***now*** has far less to do with the federal reserve, and far more to do with the pandemic and congress.

Rising inflation is correlated with the speed and rate in which the Fed will rise rates to cap inflation. Makes pretty good sense as well as OP's case about passing along costs to consumers. 

Which is why I didn't believe the dip last week on concerns about inflation. The dip that will come when the Fed rise rates. OFC the markets aren't that logical dips can be 10-20%. Even more for certain stocks or alternative investment vehicles that got overinflated by the easy money. I'm still very bullish on the market in the long run (5-10yrs) regardless since the spike in inflation is likely temporary and will be mellowed out as supply constraints ease and Fed raises rates. Meanwhile rates are low, but a slight increase in rates would actually do good at a certain point. At current rates, bonds are a sucker's game. Equity is really your only choice if you're not investing in your own small biz, education/training, real estate, or something that reaps higher returns than the joke returns of bonds right now.

In respect to FAAAM, I don't think rates or inflation would effect them much if you're an INVESTOR.

You can use the dollar or other fiat currencies, but you have the Fed and other central banks that may easily decide to issue more and debase all of the existing currency. This is the central inflation problem.

Over time the market will have: more dollars (because of monetary inflation) and fewer bitcoins (because some bitcoins get lost).

If *all* else is equal, bitcoin prices in dollar will increase, not because bitcoin is intrinsically more valuable, but because dollar is less valuable.

(however, the value of bitcoin does increase, based on how much you can trust its integrity, the network effects, etc, but that's a separate topic; so even if the dollar doesn't inflate much, bitcoin price in dollar will grow)

\---

In addition, on top bitcoin we have an emerging decentralized financial system that don't require banks and opaque trust on auditing firms, regulatory bodies, etc. These decentralized financials can run with smart contracts and other electronic means, and bitcoin is just the reserve asset and a base layer of settlement (just like a central bank).

But then why choose bitcoin, rather than ETH, for the reserve asset?

ETH is inflationary, since there's no cap on issuance. It's fine for smart contracts though, so ETH is more like a utility / commodity that gets consumed than a reserve asset. ETH actually needs to be cheap to be useful.

What about other non-inflationary coins? Bitcoin is the longest running chain, most stable technologically, with the most participants and most stable monetary policy. Trust matters. Network effect matters. It's extremely hard to replace bitcoin now.",[],0

And it's now tanked almost 40% at a time when you would expect any idea of inflation protection to be the strongest driver of the asset class. Something... doesn't add up here.

Treasury yields did rise because of inflation expectation.

CPI inflation (which is a bullshit measure of inflation) goes up, people expect the Fed to increase rates (eventually), the expectation is enough to reduce the amount of dollars available.

But that's a minutia of the macro-economics.

The real macro-economics is that the there's so much debt to be paid by the US government and companies that the only solution is to inflate the debt problem away (not the first time it'll happen). This is what bitcoin will protect you from.",[],0
759,gyrcht9,2021-05-19,t3_ngamt2,investing,"IMO you’re making some fundamental errors that show you’re probably deeply into traditional markets and can’t wrap your head around what’s on the horizon. 

First, Bitcoin is whatever the people developing it, on it or using it say it is. In many South American countries it’s just a currency at this point. Many people on Reddit treat it like a store of value and view it as digital gold. Most people with money right now though, treat it as another stock. 

So if you’re in traditional finance you’re going to hear claims that make no sense based on what it’s doing.  Because some dude in El Salvador buying lunch is not going to move the price but a hedge fund treating it like any other stock putting a billion in and moving money when they get signals from the market. 

Right now it can’t be a hedge against inflation because the people who are heavy hit by inflation, people heavily leveraged, will have to exit regardless of what point of the cycle we are in. 

Also, why are we still bringing up CPI?  We all seem to agree it’s a bad measure of inflation as it’s missing key things that tend to go up with inflation. But when it supports our argument we just ignore these obvious flaws. 

With that, we are talking about inflation from official numbers when we all can see with our eyes prices are flying up while the fed is claiming nothing is wrong. Are we to believe these people can’t adjust how these numbers are calculated to make sure they say what the politicians demand the data to say?  

Bitcoin is like the internet but we can all buy a piece. We have no idea what it will become and what it will look like on that journey but to look at the past to make claims about cutting edge technology makes no sense to me and I don’t get how people who follow markets don’t get that. 

People do a ton of research, make amazing investments, predict everything but a market crash right before their retirement. We can’t predict the future and we need to stop being so confident that we can. Look how poor all of the Covid models look a year later, they look like wild guesses from a doomsayer. 

If you have 0% or 100% of your money in Bitcoin you’re equally stupid. The only question is whether you should put in 1% or more but everyone should have some. If the bulls are right and Bitcoin goes to $1 million or more $100 now would be like $2500. Would you really miss $100?

I lived in Taiwan, worked for Taiwanese tech and have many friends there. Taiwanese work hard, long hours + really dominate chip industry. I don't see a reason why not to bet part of portfolio on them. It seems good value. 

Similar logic applies to Japanese companies. Can find cheap value stocks with 5% of dividend. 

I am a bit trapped in mindset ""you can't beat up market, stop being illusional""

But here is a thing, Charlie Munger himself said is over diversification is negative. 

I doubt Tesla can beat up Volkswagen in electric cars market. Volkswagen and Toyota sell highest number of cars for last two decade or what. Why would i buy index which has over valued companies like Tesla in it? 

I have invested last 2 years and picked up like max 7 companies per year. 

2019 - up 30% 
2020 - up 200% (i cashed out January and invested back in April,) 
2022 - up 25% for now

>""Bitcoin is gold for the 21st century""...

People forget, never learned, or are intentionally misinformed about why it was advantageous to move away from assets like Gold. Fundamentally, your Money Supply (and velocity) should mirror your real Economic Growth. If there are significant barriers to grow the money supply (like mining), then you get unstable prices.

Fiat Money with good policy and controls produces stable prices and more predictable markets.

>**Bitcoin As Inflation Protection = Bad Narrative**

>I have said for a long time that bitcoin is a RISK ASSET. It's yet another in a long line of strong performing financial assets that have done well in our environment of excess liquidity and low inflation. In this light, it's not that different from the growth investing asset class.

Dang. Great observation!

>If bitcoin actually served as any form of inflation protection, then why in the world did it tank 12%

This is the problem people don't understand because there is fixed amount or growth, most crypto (or at least all that I know of) are BY DESIGN price unstable! Sure that's attractive on the upswing, but it sure as heck hurts on the down.

>**Bad Economic Narratives Dominate Bitcoin Beliefs**

100% Love and believe in the tech. Really pity most of the community and deliberate misinformation.

>* How many times do people need to show you M2 charts...

Amazing, brilliant, absolutely salient points made in this section. But they will largely fall on deaf ears because these specifics are not easy to understand in a short post or study session, but memes are. Don't get me wrong, you got my upvote and admiration for fighting the good fight and trying to educate, but it's an uphill battle that takes bloodshed for people to pay attention to.

>no clue whether Bitcoin will serve any actual functions aside from speculative ownership.

My personal take is that the future is somewhere in crypto not in Bitcoin, specifically. And while I may like certain projects that seem to be adapting to change like Ethereum, it frankly may be the case that the crypto that rules the future hasn't been invented yet.

Hello everyone! This is my first time posting to this sub. I am looking into whether or not a Roth IRA makes sense for me, but I am having some trouble determining whether or not I qualify for one. I read up on the irs.gov site about qualifications but honestly I’m still a bit confused. I called Fidelity, my broker, to ask their opinion and they said yes that I qualify but something still seems off to me. The irs.gov site seems to say that if you are covered by a retirement plan by your employer, such as a 403B, then the max income that you can have is much lower than my income. So I’m just confused. Yes I am covered by my employer for a 403B, and my adjusted gross income last year was $95,000. I will file my income taxes this upcoming year as single head of household. Do I qualify for a Roth IRA? Thank you advance!",[],0

This is true enough if you compare it to other irresponsibly managed fiat currencies (but I repeat myself). If you compare to gold or other real things the USD has plummeted in real value over that time.

You are making the wrong comparison. 

The argument for coinz as inflation hedges is that they cannot be printed in arbitrary amounts. So you would expect them not to plummet in value over the longer term.

From [bloomberg's article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-12/hertz-picks-knighthead-certares-offer-in-bankruptcy-auction):

> In a deal that hands a huge victory to shareholders of bankrupt Hertz Global Holdings Inc., the car renter picked Knighthead Capital Management and Certares Management to buy the company out of Chapter 11, capping a dramatic brawl for control of the company.
> 
> The deal, which gives a reorganized Hertz an enterprise value of $7.43 billion, was picked over an offer from a competing group led by Centerbridge Partners, Warburg Pincus and Dundon Capital Partners, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the plan hasn’t been made public. The Knighthead-Certares plan would give equity holders a recovery of about $8 a share -- a package that’s made up of about $240 million in cash and warrants for nearly 20% of the reorganized company, the people said.
> 
> Hertz shares -- which up until two months ago were faced with the prospects of being completely wiped out under an earlier plan -- soared as much as 41% Wednesday to as high as $5.19. That approached a high of $6.25 last June, when traders snapping up penny stocks on the popular Robinhood app sought to defy decades of convention and make money on a bankrupt company.
> 
> Representatives for Knighthead, Certares and Warburg Pincus declined to comment, while Hertz, Dundon and Centerbridge didn’t immediately provide comment.
> 
> 
> Hertz shares soar above $4 on bankruptcy exit plans
> The Knighthead-Certares group’s win brings the pandemic’s biggest Chapter 11 case nearer to a close, with Hertz seeking to exit court protection in June. Judge Mary Walrath must approve the final plan in Delaware bankruptcy court.
> 
> Investment firms have been dueling over ownership of Hertz for weeks, with both groups seeking to top the other with multiple rounds of proposals. An earlier Knighthead proposal valued Hertz’s equity at around $2.25 a share, with an enterprise value of $6.2 billion, Bloomberg previously reported.
> 
> As part of the winning plan, Apollo Global Management has committed $1.5 billion of preferred equity. Investors also would have the option to participate in a $1.6 billion rights offering.
> 
> The competition came amid surging demand for rentals and summer travel that has let many car renters raise prices while still leaving them without enough vehicles for customers to drive off the lot. Rival Avis Budget Group Inc. has seen its shares more than double this year.
> 
> Final proposals from both groups offered lenders and bondholders full repayment along with the share recovery, a relative rarity in bankruptcy proceedings. Hertz initially chose an iteration of the Centerbridge group’s plan, and Walrath last month approved a so-called breakup fee for those funds if they were later outbid.
> 
> Hertz sought bankruptcy protection in May 2020 when the near-total shutdown of the global travel industry sent its rental revenues plunging. Equity holders initially appeared to be wiped out, while junior bondholders were slated to take a haircut. Still, Hertz became a popular stock among day traders, who sent shares rocketing on optimism that they could defy the norms of bankruptcy court and win a payout. The stock frenzy even briefly helped the company fund its bankruptcy by selling new equity.

Just because some people bought at the top and sold at the bottom isn’t bitcoins problem. 

If bitcoin fell to precovid levels, this would make sense however.",[],0
