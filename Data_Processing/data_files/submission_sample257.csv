76,2021-05-23,algotrading,"Hi,

I know tradingview pine script is flawed and limited, but I’m very early on in my algotrading journey and don’t know any python yet.

After 50-100 hours I’ve come up with a strategy for BTCUSD. I think I’m on to something with it, backtesting suggests it profits both long and short no matter what direction BTC is trending in. It has pretty killer returns on a monthly basis with minimal drawdowns (and yes I’m including commission, spread, and slippage, but it could be a little overfit)

The thing is it has a Sharpe ratio of only 0.67

I’ve tweaked the same strategy and applied it to SPY and EURUSD and I’m able to get a sharpe of about 1.3 but the returns vs drawdown are worse than my BTC version. I’ve heard sharpe penalizes volatility in your favor, and sortino ratio can be better bc it doesn’t.

So I’d like to figure how to calculate sortino. Preferably not manually because I have about 1000 trades

thanks!",nj3k4h,[],0
84,2021-05-23,algotrading,"**Note: This is an open source project and it will always be so**

The algorithm was initially designed to find the most bullish coins on Binance and buy in as long as the increase in price continues. It's been great working on this for the past few weeks alongside other talented developers who have been improving upon the original code on GitHub. 

The project gathered significant attention from the GitHub dev community, and have helped to make significant improvements to the original codebase, and I thought you guys might like it as well. 

The code was built with customisability in mind, where each user can modify parameters like:

* Define what % increase constitues a buy signal
* Time elapsed between price checks
* Trailing stop loss / take profit
* Stop buying when the market is bearish

In addition to the core functionality, the algorithm is now able to receive and act on external signals which are fully customisable.

It uses data from Tradingview, and this returns buy signals according to the most relevant indicators. BY default if at least 18 out of 26 indicators agree that it's a good time to buy a certain coin, this will tell the bot to go buy that coin.

The bot also has a newly-implement pause functionality. It essentially analyses 15 moving average indicators and if half of them show that's a bearish market, the bot will not buy during this period.

You can also choose and pick any number of custom indicators from oscillators to moving averages and more. Those require a bit of coding, and I'm hoping to make it more user-friendly in the future but the core functionality is there.

The bot has a test mode that simulates live trades in real-market conditions so you can see how it performs without the risk of losing money. The project is still in the experimental phase, so it's quite early to determine its potential profitability.

If you're comfortable with Python and would like to inspect the source code please be my guest:

[https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/Binance-volatility-trading-bot](https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/Binance-volatility-trading-bot)

The only core functionality that is missing at the moment is a backtesting module, and I'm currently looking into that.

2. Expect to spend 3-5 years coming up with remotely consistent/profitable method. That's assuming you put 20h+/week in it. 80% spent on your strategy development, 10% on experiments, 10% on automation
3. Watching online videos / reading reddit generally doesn't contribute to your becoming better at this. Count those hours separately and limit them
4. Become an expert in your method. Stop switching
5. Find your own truth. What makes one trader successful might kill another one if used outside of their original method. Only you can tell if that applies to you
6. Look for an edge big/smart money can't take advantage of (hint - liquidity)
7. Remember, automation lets you do more of ""what works"" and spending less time doing that, focus on figuring out what works before automating
8. Separate strategy from execution and automation
9. Spend most of your time on the strategy and its validation
10. Know your costs / feasibility of fills. Run live experiments.
11. Make first automation bare-bones, your strategy will likely fail anyway
12. Top reasons why your strategy will fail: incorrect (a) test (b) data (c) costs/execution assumptions or (d) inability to take a trade. Incorporate those into your validation process
13. Be sceptical of test results with less than 1000 trades
14. Be sceptical of test results covering one market cycle
15. No single strategy work for all market conditions, know your favorable conditions and have realistic expectations
16. Good strategy is the one that works well during favorable conditions and doesn't lose too much while waiting for them
17. Holy grail of trading is running multiple non-correlated strategies specializing on different market conditions
18. Know your expected Max DD. Expect live Max DD be 2x of your worst backtest
19. Don't go down the rabbit hole of thinking learning a new language/framework will help your trading. Generally it doesn't with rare exceptions
20. Increase your trading capital gradually as you gain confidence in your method
21. Once you are trading live, don't obsess over $ fluctuations. It's mostly noise that will keep you distracted
22. Only 2 things matter when running live - (a) if your model=backtest staying within expected parameters (b) if your live executions are matching your model
23. Know when to shutdown your system

170,2021-05-23,algotrading,"Hi, for the last few months I've been busy trying out this library: [https://quarkfin.github.io/qf-lib-info/](https://quarkfin.github.io/qf-lib-info/)

&#x200B;

It is a very powerful backtesting code. I found that you are able to perform backtests for multiple tickers, strategies and timeframes all at once. My God it can give an edge!

&#x200B;

So why am I writing here? This library is not popular at all, hence it has no community support, no one to ask an advice for (except for the developers themselves). I believe that with a larger community, this library could grow larger, become better and better.

&#x200B;

The big problem is the speed of Python (which is notoriously slow). With my decent computer, using 1MIN data, launching a backtest for 15MIN timeframe and using two indicators (one on 15MIN, other on 60MIN timeframes), I calculated that my computer would take about 20hours for the backtest of one year.

&#x200B;

Yes, pretty slow.

&#x200B;

On the other hands, the library has deleted a look-ahead bias, has commission models, slippage model, so with all that- it makes sense that it's so slow.

&#x200B;

Since I have started to know how to work with it- you can ask me about it, I'll try to answer and perhaps we will be a part of making the code better

\- **Max drawdown** of -8.7% (thought this was pretty interesting - W\*B would be a very cool hedge for financial markets at large. Rode COVID like a wave)

\- **Sharpe Ratio**: 2.22. Here's an [investopedia link](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp) for those of you that can read

You're also realizing that you started on the initial backtesting project over a year ago and that's where most of your time and effort was spent; you're questioning whether to even change your code because you're considering how long it would take to start backtesting a new strategy and then how long till you actually get to test this new strategy for real like you did today to see if it even works. You're so frustrated you grab a rock and smash your computer with it; the monitor falls off the desk and the screen cracks into a spiderweb manifesting every backtest you ever backtested, but in each shard of glass you can see a small window into your soul, a reflection of yourself in a parallel reality--a prehistoric caveman who backtested himself into a corner by his own fate.

315,2021-05-24,algotrading,"My Last post got removed, might be because it was just an introduction of the API behind our trading algorithm.

Now let's talk about the trading algo itself. 

The philosophy is still following probability trading from TastyTrade, but we applied a couple of concepts of our own. 

The flow of the algorithm is as follows, 

1. Earnings Options Trades only, enter right before the Earnings to take advantage of max volatility. 

2. Find stocks with top performance in the last 2 years. (Rolling)

3. To qualify for our trading, it needs to stay above $30, only offer weekly options and have a winning percentage over 40%.

We used hedginglab.com API to achieve this step. 

Among all the options strategies, we picked Iron Condor for our first experiment. 

Candidates of the best performed stocks between 2019 to 2020 are: 

'CPRI', 'TIF', 'LEN', 'BUD', 'CSX', 'LMT', 'PNC', 'V', 'VZ', 'GD', 'JNJ', 'WHR', 'ZS', 'AMTD', 'GLW', 'OKE', 'CHWY', 'DAL', 'DPZ', 'HOG', 'SLB', 'TRIP', 'CNC', 'ABC', 'ADI', 'AKAM', 'AMT', 'BDX', 'BSX', 'CI', 'CME', 'CMG', 'CMI', 'CREE', 'CVNA', 'CYBR', 'EMR', 'FDX', 'GOOG', 'GS', 'HAS', 'HSY', 'LULU', 'MSFT', 'OLED', 'ORCL', 'OXY', 'PLAY', 'SAGE', 'SBUX'

Back testing is also done using Hedginglab.com API. Now we use the first quarter of 2021 to test earnings trades using those stocks. 

The loss of Iron Condor is limited and we can scale each of our trade to have a max of $2k loss.

As mentioned in the beginning, curious to know your thoughts on this. Do you think that would be useful or not really? Why? One reason I’m thinking it might be overkill is perhaps most tick-based strategies are backtested on small time periods, while it’s the buy-and-hold strategies that will be tested on the longer periods of time, meaning that the size of the backtest would be fairly small in either case.

A bit of background: I am software developer specializing in automating my clients’ trading strategies with Interactive Brokers API in Python. I am not a professional trader, or even a hobbyist for that matter, which is why your opinions will be so valuable to me.

Recently I've been thinking about developing a backtesting framework based on \`ib\_insync\`, but leveraging Cython and C++ to get rid of the Python overhead as much as possible. 

In the first step, I am thinking of basically making a perfect copy of \`ib\_insync\` in C++ and exposing to Python with Cython. The goal would be to enable Python developers to write their code either in Cython or Python and be able to seamlessly switch between \`ib\_insync\` and this library. That way, you can write your code using \`ib\_insync\` to help with debugging (setting up Cython debugging is very complex), but you can then just switch to the Cython/C++ version with just one line of code in your \`main.py\`.

The next step would then be to implement Cython tools around that library that will help with backtesting. The idea is that you develop your code for live trading and then just run it with the backtesting harness without having to change your live-ready code at all (no work duplication and not having to maintain two versions). The advantage of this is, again, removing the Python overhead. The speed gain here will be important since, to achieve it, the backtesting will have to run a loop that feeds your algo the historical data candle by candle (or trade by trade) and there will be no vectorizing with \`numpy\`, all of which is extremely slow in Python.

The final step is build optimization algorithms (genetic algorithms, etc) that leverage all this functionality to optimize your algorithm’s parameters.

I've been thinking about this setup for some time, and I think I have the C components I will need to make this happen. For I/O, it’s possible to use the \[async POSIX.1b standard\]([https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html\_node/Asynchronous-I\_002fO.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Asynchronous-I_002fO.html)). And \[this little library\]([https://github.com/naasking/async.h/tree/master/async](https://github.com/naasking/async.h/tree/master/async)) mimics Python’s \`asyncio\`.

As mentioned in the beginning, curious to know your thoughts on this. Do you think that would be useful or not really? Why?

456,2021-05-15,algotrading,"I've been trying to learn more about how cryptocurrencies differ from traditional asset classes, and one paper that caught my eye was this recent piece - [""Cryptocurrencies as an Asset Class? An Empirical Assessment""](https://jai.pm-research.com/content/23/2/162) published last fall in the Journal of Alternative Investments.

I am not a finance researcher so I can not speak to the credibility of the journal or the author, but the analysis the author presents for his claims seem credible enough from my layman's perspective (understandable, all models and sources used, etc.).

Main takeaways I had from the paper:

* No significant correlation between cryptocurrencies and other traditional asset classes on returns or volatility. 
   * Only significant correlation was with commodities like gold, on both volatility and risk. 
      * Share common features like a limited supply and their price being driven by aggregate demand and being seen as ""alternatives"" to traditional financial institutions.
* Negative, but not significant, correlation on volatility compared to other assets.
* Significant correlation between trading volume and returns occurring at the same time, as with assets like stock.
* Correlation between lagging returns (returns in the past) and trading volume, hence also future returns.
* Positive and significant correlation between trading volume and volatility (more trading --> more risk), but lagging volatility lead to less trading volume.
* Trading volume effected by both volatility and past returns, but more so the latter.
* Trading activity not significantly correlated with macroeconomic indicators.

790,2021-05-25,algotrading,"Hello,

I hope everyone is having a great day today!  I've been pondering an issue, and I was wondering if there was some sort of convention, or what methods you all might have been successful with when it comes to averaging window size vs frequency of the underlying equity's movement.

So, nearly every algorithm that I've coded uses some form of averaging or measurement over a defined window (number of cycles 15 seconds, minute, hour, etc.).  When trading manually, I usually change these periods to match the current movement in the underlying that I'm trading.  Of course, what works best on one day, isn't what will work best at another point in time.  If you averages are too slow, and the frequency of the underlying moves faster, you end up slow to pull the trigger, and you buy high, and sell low.  When you are using to small of period, you can hop in and out of an otherwise great up trend =losing money.

For my bots, I usually manually adjust these until they are good, and then I use a series of nested for loops (Python) to run through all of the different combinations to tune the algorithm to the best performance.  Based on the time period you tune it over it makes a huge difference.  What works best over a five year period, might really suck it for months in a row, but make up for it during big run ups.  If you choose a bear cycle, it won't perform well for bull.  ...and on and on.

I usually choose a fairly short window to run my optimization (as outlined above), and do have the bot do this regularly and adjust.  My thoughts are that this keeps it in step with the current conditions. 

What I've been thinking about lately is to try and perform a Fourier Analysis to determine the strongest frequency of the underlying, and corelate the tuning with that.  I'm assuming that most every strategy uses time window based analysis at it's core, so this is something that should also plague and bot.  So what types of remediation do you guys use for accounting for this.  I guess you could just choose a steady equity with less chop, but for those who trade momentum on higher volatility equities, what have you found that works?

Thanks in advance for any conversation around this!  I really appreciate this community, and I love when there is good debate on techniques.

I have already studied an elementary econometric course covering regression, multiple regression, binary, logit and probit etc, etc. In the next year or so I will  have the option to choose some more intermediate level to advanced econometric courses. I'm just wondering how applicable the models ill learn in econometrics are to issues outside the social science spectrum? That is, the application of econometric models to data for purposes of non-formal analysis, maybe even call it ""recreational analysis"". For example, i know that certain models when meeting certain conditions, can be applied to social science type issues/experiments, but what if i wanted to try leverage econometric modelling to perform analysis on more niche things such as sports (like is presented in moneyball for example) or even other games such as card games or stocks(though i know econometrics is already prevalent here).  I love finance and have an avid interest in statistics, stata and other programming languages, and want to deepen my statistical modelling capacity  beyond that of regressions, etc. I am really considering chasing this pathway, however, i am worried that the absence of applicability to anything outside of social science type experiments , in addition to a high focus on theoretical content over practical implementation will lead to growing boredom of the subject if i were to study it.  Hence, why i ask whether what i learn can be to at least some extent applied to recreational type ""experiments"", where my knowledge feels more tangible as i can actively apply what i have learnt to things that can be analysed with statistics and that are of interest to me, outside on my studies of course.",ne5v5k,[],1

Hi All --

I'm looking on acquiring ES tick by tick data in order to do some analysis for a strategy I'm currently working on developing. AlgoSeek was able to offer me a dataset that would include ES data that goes all the way back to 2010 for 1900 US dollars, but I was wondering if anyone knew of any cheaper options to get high quality data like this from other sources.

Thanks!",nemjl1,[],0

I also tried to run it with live data for a while and it seems to be able to consistently generate profits. However, it makes around 1200 API calls per minute, so running it on my computer is not a very good option. Do you have any suggestions as to where to deploy the script? 

I know that Amazon has some services designed for this but as far as I know they charge you based on processing time, and my algorithm is supposed to run 24/7, so using AWS would basically cost me more than I could make (I am kinda poor since I’m a student and I was planning on giving the bot an initial amount of about 20€).

What do you guys use for your bots?

Also, do you think there is any way to make this work with less than 50€ per month?

825,2021-05-18,algotrading,"I have always been curious about game theory, but have been to intimidated to try to learn it. This week, I have decided to try and shake my fear and begin to learn about some basic principles in game theory:

I am looking at this basic problem in game theory that asks how should the owner of a company split the profits between her and her workers:

https://imgur.com/a/aDa5jiE

I am having some difficulty in understanding the notations:

1) "" Formally, a coalitional game is defined as: There is a set N (of n players) and a function and a function v that maps subsets of players to the real numbers: v : 2^N -> R , where v(""empty set"") = 0""

a ) Why does "" v : 2^N ""? Is the point of this expression to show all the possible interactions that can exist between any groups of players? 

b) When considering the ""value function"" (i.e. ""v"") , why does v (""empty set"") = 0? I guess this is an obvious statement, but is it supposed to mean that the potential value of the interaction between ""no players"" (i.e. the empty set) is ""0""?

2) Now, the problem where the owner of a company split the profits between her and her workers:

- The owner is represented by the symbol ""o""
- There are ""m"" number of workers (w1, w2, w3 ... wm)
- Each worker contributes an amount ""p"" to the profit

I am having difficulty understanding how the ""value function"" for this problem is determined:

The value function for the coalition of players (the coalition is denoted by ""S"") is:

- v(S) = mp, if the owner is included in the coalition 
- v(S) = 0, if the owner is not included in the coalition 

My question: How are v(S) = mp and v(S) = 0 initially determined? Or are these values assumed?

3) In this question, ""m"" is defined both as ""the number of workers"" as well as the cardinality of : S / {o} .

I have generally heard ""cardinality"" referred to as the ""size of a set"". What exactly does cardinality mean in this question? Are you supposed to be able to compute "" S / {o} ""? Why does ""S / {o}"" = m?

4) Can someone please walk me through the calculations? Why according to the Shapley values, should the profit be distributed such that: the owner receive ""mp/2"" and each worker receive ""p/2""? 

5) Lastly : Why is this question important? Is the point of this question to show ""the fairest distribution of profits according to contributions""?

Thanks

So far I had little success because of high fees and low price volatility. The main problem is that if I hold some asset for more than 30 seconds it becomes unreasonable because the bot itself cant see that far into the future.

I know that HFT is a thing but in my case its about 250ms latency so its not that.

So before I spend another 60hours on this, since I have little experience in finance I want to know: does trading high volatility stocks make sense on intervals 30sec or less, or the profit will not cover transaction fees and Im better off developing longer period strategies?

So far I did binance using real time orderbook data, 0.01% fees, +0.02% take profit and -0.1% stop loss. At best it went from 10k to 10k+8$ in a few minutes and then bought DOGECOIN and went to 10k-50$. Average scenario it looses about 1-2$ a minute (OMEGALUL). I can see some ways of improving it but I feel like Im trying to achieve smth which is not feasible without collocation and other serious HFT stuff.

I have an idea which revolves around exploring options chain pricing inefficiencies (assuming my math is correct).

In order for my idea to work I need to design a system which can monitor options prices of a handful of companies with large options chains. I have written a matlab script which can take in option spread information along with the stocks variance metric and let me know if there is a likely profitable trade. I won’t go into the specifics here, what I have made is not perfect.

Ideally this would then run over the course of trading days and notify me of any opportunities it see. 

In order for this to work, I need to be able to run my code continuously and retrieve up to date option chain data which can be fed into my script. Is the best way to get this data to physically data scrape financial sites, or are there any python api or packages that would work better?

832,2021-05-17,algotrading,"Sorry if this is not the right community to ask this in, but, I'm currently a second year finance and economics student, studying at a quality university with a higher focus on quantitative methods. I have already studied an elementary econometric course covering regression, multiple regression, binary, logit and probit etc, etc. In the next year or so I will  have the option to choose some more intermediate level to advanced econometric courses. I'm just wondering how applicable the models ill learn in econometrics are to issues outside the social science spectrum? That is, the application of econometric models to data for purposes of non-formal analysis, maybe even call it ""recreational analysis"". For example, i know that certain models when meeting certain conditions, can be applied to social science type issues/experiments, but what if i wanted to try leverage econometric modelling to perform analysis on more niche things such as sports (like is presented in moneyball for example) or even other games such as card games or stocks(though i know econometrics is already prevalent here).  I love finance and have an avid interest in statistics, stata and other programming languages, and want to deepen my statistical modelling capacity  beyond that of regressions, etc. I am really considering chasing this pathway, however, i am worried that the absence of applicability to anything outside of social science type experiments , in addition to a high focus on theoretical content over practical implementation will lead to growing boredom of the subject if i were to study it.  Hence, why i ask whether what i learn can be to at least some extent applied to recreational type ""experiments"", where my knowledge feels more tangible as i can actively apply what i have learnt to things that can be analysed with statistics and that are of interest to me, outside on my studies of course.",ne5v5k,[],1

Given n stocks that were successful at a strategy (or conversely m stocks that weren't), how would you find what they had in common?

 - general strategies for consuming this type of data
 - specific formats that are commonly used

For context, I'm building a crypto intelligence platform - basically it aggregates meta-information from many sources (source repositories, social accounts, blogs, forums, governance) into a structured feed of events (releases, partnerships, listings).

843,2021-05-18,algotrading,"I have always been curious about game theory, but have been to intimidated to try to learn it. This week, I have decided to try and shake my fear and begin to learn about some basic principles in game theory:

I am looking at this basic problem in game theory that asks how should the owner of a company split the profits between her and her workers:

https://imgur.com/a/aDa5jiE

I am having some difficulty in understanding the notations:

1) "" Formally, a coalitional game is defined as: There is a set N (of n players) and a function and a function v that maps subsets of players to the real numbers: v : 2^N -> R , where v(""empty set"") = 0""

a ) Why does "" v : 2^N ""? Is the point of this expression to show all the possible interactions that can exist between any groups of players? 

b) When considering the ""value function"" (i.e. ""v"") , why does v (""empty set"") = 0? I guess this is an obvious statement, but is it supposed to mean that the potential value of the interaction between ""no players"" (i.e. the empty set) is ""0""?

2) Now, the problem where the owner of a company split the profits between her and her workers:

- The owner is represented by the symbol ""o""
- There are ""m"" number of workers (w1, w2, w3 ... wm)
- Each worker contributes an amount ""p"" to the profit

I am having difficulty understanding how the ""value function"" for this problem is determined:

The value function for the coalition of players (the coalition is denoted by ""S"") is:

- v(S) = mp, if the owner is included in the coalition 
- v(S) = 0, if the owner is not included in the coalition 

My question: How are v(S) = mp and v(S) = 0 initially determined? Or are these values assumed?

3) In this question, ""m"" is defined both as ""the number of workers"" as well as the cardinality of : S / {o} .

I have generally heard ""cardinality"" referred to as the ""size of a set"". What exactly does cardinality mean in this question? Are you supposed to be able to compute "" S / {o} ""? Why does ""S / {o}"" = m?

4) Can someone please walk me through the calculations? Why according to the Shapley values, should the profit be distributed such that: the owner receive ""mp/2"" and each worker receive ""p/2""? 

5) Lastly : Why is this question important? Is the point of this question to show ""the fairest distribution of profits according to contributions""?

Thanks

I know that HFT is a thing but in my case its about 250ms latency so its not that.

So before I spend another 60hours on this, since I have little experience in finance I want to know: does trading high volatility stocks make sense on intervals 30sec or less, or the profit will not cover transaction fees and Im better off developing longer period strategies?

So far I did binance using real time orderbook data, 0.01% fees, +0.02% take profit and -0.1% stop loss.

I'm a programmer with about 15 years of experience and I've already written an application in C# that scrapes stocks and automatically places orders through an API. This all works well. The issue I'm experiencing is that I'm trying to make an intelligent machine that will make the decision to Buy, Sell, or Hold on every 1 second interval.

I've done a loooooot of research into ML the past three months and I'm currently using Google's Tensorflow to try and create an Agent that can do this. I'm having varying degrees of success

My first model was a modified DQN ( [https://github.com/benjamin-dupuis/DQN-snake](https://github.com/benjamin-dupuis/DQN-snake)) It was kind of close, but I just couldn't get a reliable sell to occur. It buys, and holds well, but the sell is unreliable.

I then discovered the Multi Armed Bandit model ([https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/bandits\_tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/bandits_tutorial)) and that sounded a little bit closer. I used some of Googles samples to build an MAB using a couple of different types: Linear Stochastic and a Drifting Stochastic. Neither worked quite as well as I hoped either.

Has anyone had good experience with autotrading using a specific DQN or MAB model? I'm wondering if I'm expecting too much from machine learning...

https://www.quant-investing.com/blogs/general/2015/02/16/truths-about-stop-losses-that-nobody-wants-to-believe

This article suggests that a 20% stop loss is best to use, because the 5, 10, etc stop you out too soon. Lower stop-losses tend to offset and major losses in a short period, but over a long term they are wildly less profitable. I was curious if anyone else had found the same?

Here's my backtests:

Over 1,500 trades a 10% stop-loss would net me a 1.35% return (per 100% of my account traded).

Over the same 1,500 trades a 20% stop-loss would net me a 2.3% return (per 100% of my account traded).

Now, I'm not suggesting that 1,500 trades is a good back test. I would probably aim for a number closer to 10,000. However, the article tested this method over 85 years! Using my specific test as an example, I was very surprised to find such a wild difference in profit. I was curious if anyone else has had similar results? If so, why do you think this is?


Note: I only throw about 10% of my account at any single trade. So if a 20% stop loss did occur, it would be a 2% hit on my overall account which aligns with the following article:

It's a nested dictionary that mixes dicts and lists, where (at least) one of the lists has a single member that is a dict (at least that is how Python views it).

I really struggled to deal with it, and the only way I found to completely decompose it to (key, value) pairs was to use recursion. To save others the pain I went through, I created a GitHub repo with a couple of examples that will:

870,2021-05-20,algotrading,"Hi everyone,

for a grad level Machine Learning Class I recently completed, I built a decision tree to predict whether  a stock from the 30 companies in the DOW would return 0.5% or more by end of a week using the previous 6 weeks of data.

Our data was limited to the 2011 Q1 and Q2 Dataset, and just included Weekly stock price, volume, days to dividend, and % dividend. we trained on Q1 and tested on Q2.  We found our tree performed best using an RSI indicator, MACD indicator, Previous Week Price Change, previous 6 Week price change, days to dividend, and % dividend return.

Moving forward, despite overfitting with too many parameters being a constant theme that people warn about (with good reason I'm sure), I'd like to try building some huge trees/neural networks using just about as many attributes as possible and then start eliminating those that seem to do more harm than good.

Like before I will be choosing from the DOW, but I'll be incorporating other factors.  Previously my only live Algotrading has been with crypto, and frankly has been very frustrating.  I've learned how TA indicators really are just a little better than a coinflip, and there are much fewer attributes to incorporate with Cryptos as opposed to an actual stock in a company.  Hence why I'd like to try incorporating as many attributes as possible since I've felt really limited to just TA indicators with crypto trading.  

I've listed all the parameters I want to start pulling data for below, but please add any that I have not thought of.  Please feel free to give any advice on how to best apply these indicators (eg, how long of a moving average should I use for tracking Number of Mentions in Social Media? 2 days? Hourly? Weekly?....)  Also feel free to point out if any of my suggested attributes are particularly important or totally useless.  Thanks so much for any insight! It will save me countless hours working with data that winds up being completely useless

&#x200B;

Currently, the list of params I think I would be useful and want to incorporate:

1) Use of 2-3 Technical Indicators at Most 

 \-> This is probably my biggest concern.  From what I've read on here, using multiple TA to make a tree  or neural network is essentially just mutating the same data over and over again, which doesn't produce distinctly different attributes that will improve prediction accuracy

\->That being said, I would think 2-3 TA indicators can help establish a positive market trend , and define whether the trend is long or short term (eg 2 week avg is above 200 day avg, and a positive MACD, I would consider a valuable set of attributes that Stock is Bullish). 

2) P/E Ratio.  This an obvious useful tool for company fundamentals.  

3) Related Raw Materials Costs (e.g. my neighbor works at a Brewing Company and mentioned how high aluminum costs and no bars pouring drafts means more canning, which has been cutting into profits despite record sales)

4) Overall Market Trend (is DOW/S&P bearish or bullish)

5) Relationship to Similar Companies (e.g. is Coke lagging behind Pepsi? Do we expect Coke to Rise or Pepsi to Crash, or both?)

6) Scan internet for major News Outlet Mentions (e.g. Did Jim Cramer recommend on his show?)

7)  Sentiment Analysis and Popularity Growth from Reddit,Twitter (is it increasing or decreasing? Is sentiment mostly positive?)

8) VIX to incorporate risk due to volatility, help define higher/lower bail thresholds

9) Strike Prices and Expirations Dates of Puts/Calls (essentially applying the Max Pain strategy where major Hedge Funds that sell options try to manipulate prices to not go above/below a certain range to ensure the vast majority of options expire worthless.)

10) Depth Charts to view major sell/buy walls

11) Days to Dividend, % Dividend Return

&#x200B;

\*As  a side note, I wanted to mention that I've found Volume to be completely useless attribute, but perhaps I'm not using it right.  Even if I'm able to see if most of the buying is Maker side (which is not always available info), I already can tell because the price is increasing, as one would expect.  The price and Buy Volume I've found are essentially just the same data, if buy volume increases, price increases proportionally.  The only strat I've heard that uses volume that sort of makes sense is that big money Firms tend to increase volume substantially, while keeping price as unchanged as possible, and eventually reduce supply until price eventually does jump.  Other than that, I've yet to find a way to use volume effectively, but please let me know if I'm completely missing something here.

&#x200B;

I guess I'll make this short and sweet - though I'm not an algotrader (Im a junior engineer who likes playing with data), I wanted to do some analysis on historic stock prices (unfortunately as of now I can only do full day quotes - but looking to expand that) and after all sorts of frustration and rate limits and all these non free API's I quickly got distracted and wanted to solve that problem instead more than the data I wanted to look at. 

&#x200B;

my creation - [https://github.com/Stonks/tickers](https://github.com/Stonks/tickers)

NYSE - [https://github.com/Stonks/tickers/tree/main/tickers/nyse](https://github.com/Stonks/tickers/tree/main/tickers/nyse)

NASDAQ - [https://github.com/Stonks/tickers/tree/main/tickers/nasdaq](https://github.com/Stonks/tickers/tree/main/tickers/nasdaq)

&#x200B;

I've created a repo that will update every 24 hours with the latest (and basically all the past data since their listing) of all the stocks in the NYSE and NASDAQ. Currently it just outputs it into a CSV, but for those who fancy using it as an API to just sloppily fetch all the data, I'll be having it publish json as well (hopefully I'll get it done tomorrow lol)

I know its nothing super special, but I figure for those who like to mess around with the data and aren't interested in getting railed in API fees maybe this will help with that :)

If this value is below a certain threshold, then look at the next day’s return (Close to Close).

I simulated different threshold values from 5 to 100 to measure the likelihood of the next day being a positive day and found that when the price closes nearer the low, the next day is more likely to be an up day (The x axis on the chart is the threshold and the y axis is the likelihood of the next day being an up day)

21. Increase your trading capital gradually as you gain confidence in your method
22. Once you are trading live, don't obsess over $ fluctuations. It's mostly noise that will keep you distracted

It's much more than just writing your first bot. And I almost guarantee you, your first strategy is gonna fail live (or you're truly a genius!).

911,2021-05-24,algotrading,"Recently I've been thinking about developing a backtesting framework based on `ib_insync`, but leveraging Cython and C++ to get rid of the Python overhead as much as possible.

A bit of background: I am software developer specializing in automating my clients’ trading strategies with Interactive Brokers API in Python. I am not a professional trader, or even a hobbyist for that matter, which is why your opinions will be so valuable to me.

In the first step, I am thinking of basically making a perfect copy of `ib_insync` in C++ and exposing to Python with Cython. The goal would be to enable Python developers to write their code either in Cython or Python and be able to seamlessly switch between `ib_insync` and this library with just one line of code in your `main.py`.

The next step would then be to implement Cython tools around that library that will help with backtesting. The idea is that you develop your code for live trading and then just run it with the backtesting harness without having to change your live-ready code at all (no work duplication and not having to maintain two versions). The advantage of this is, again, removing the Python overhead. The speed gain here will be important since, to achieve it, the backtesting will have to run a loop that feeds your algo the historical data candle by candle (or trade by trade) and there will be no vectorizing with `numpy`, all of which is extremely slow in Python.

The final step is build optimization algorithms (genetic algorithms, etc) that leverage all this functionality to optimize your algorithm’s parameters.

More on the technical side, I've been thinking about this setup for some time, and I think I have the C components I will need to make this happen. For I/O, it’s possible to use the async [POSIX.1b standard](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Asynchronous-I_002fO.html), [this little library](https://github.com/naasking/async.h/tree/master/async) mimics Python’s `asyncio`, and [this one](http://www.wangafu.net/~nickm/libevent-book/) can be a replacement for `eventkit`.

As mentioned in the beginning, curious to know your thoughts on this. Do you think that would be useful or not really? Why? One reason I’m thinking it might be an overkill is perhaps most tick-based strategies are backtested on small time periods, while it’s the buy-and-hold strategies that will be tested on the longer periods of time, meaning that the size of the backtest would be fairly small in either case.

**Edit:** A couple of you have pointed out there is no need for C++ type of speeds when dealing with the IB API. Very true. I am only considering providing it since, to enable proper C++/Cython optimization in the backtesting portion of the project, I would have to still re-write `ib_insync`'s data classes so as to skip Python checks when passing around things like `Trade` objects. From there, it won't be much more work to provide the rest of the framework as well.",nk2uw6,[],0
912,2021-05-24,algotrading,"Hi,

According to Robert Pardo's book `Walk-Forward Efficiency ratio = Out-Of-Sample value / In-Sample value` (also, the value should be annualized), but he does not specify how to calculate it over all runs in his book. At the moment, I'm using a median of the value (Sharpe ratio in my case), but I don't think it is correct from the statistical point of view.

How do I properly calculate a combined Walk-Forward Efficiency ratio for all passes?

Thank you.",nk5804,[],0

I'm wondering if there is a way to import historical option price data for an individual contract as opposed to the option chain. My broker provides this information, basically I would like to recreate it in R if possible!

918,2021-05-25,algotrading,"I've made a study that works reliably and I have an alert sent out so I buy SPY calls/puts whenever I get the notification, but this is tedious because I have to be available at all times. The ""buy custom"" works  but then I have to go to my laptop to check if there's already a trade placed and send that order again, this won't be possible when I start my new job where I'm on site for hours during market hours with no devices.


I want a way to auto trade options based on the studies of SPY with automatic TP and SL. 

I'm pretty good with python and R and some C# btw.

Should I try out the TD API? I've heard pretty awful things about it. Should I link ninja trader? I know that there's a big fee for that, and options trading is on the ninja trading platform only. I've also heard of eOption but I can't find much about it. 

I wouldn't mind switching brokerages if it meant getting fully auto trading down easy. But I would also like to know if I could get auto trading down with my current brokerage

I've been trying to get Binance technical indicator data for some time now, and my adventure has somewhat been unsuccessful.

So I've found a website, [taapi.io](https://taapi.io), that actually provides a lot data for all technical indicators, but some complex indicators are returning wrong values in relative to what I'm seeing in the Binance app.

I'm really desperate right now to the point where I've also tried to web scrape Binance's website for them, but Python is getting stuck a lot, and some HTML elements are not being found. (Also not all are identifiable by a unique ID)

996,2021-05-25,algotrading,"Hello,

I hope everyone is having a great day today!  I've been pondering an issue, and I was wondering if there was some sort of convention, or what methods you all might have been successful with when it comes to averaging window size vs frequency of the underlying equity's movement.

So, nearly every algorithm that I've coded uses some form of averaging or measurement over a defined window (number of cycles 15 seconds, minute, hour, etc.).  When trading manually, I usually change these periods to match the current movement in the underlying that I'm trading.  Of course, what works best on one day, isn't what will work best at another point in time.  If you averages are too slow, and the frequency of the underlying moves faster, you end up slow to pull the trigger, and you buy high, and sell low.  When you are using to small of period, you can hop in and out of an otherwise great up trend =losing money.

For my bots, I usually manually adjust these until they are good, and then I use a series of nested for loops (Python) to run through all of the different combinations to tune the algorithm to the best performance.  Based on the time period you tune it over it makes a huge difference.  What works best over a five year period, might really suck it for months in a row, but make up for it during big run ups.  If you choose a bear cycle, it won't perform well for bull.  ...and on and on.

I usually choose a fairly short window to run my optimization (as outlined above), and do have the bot do this regularly and adjust.  My thoughts are that this keeps it in step with the current conditions. 

What I've been thinking about lately is to try and perform a Fourier Analysis to determine the strongest frequency of the underlying, and corelate the tuning with that.  I'm assuming that most every strategy uses time window based analysis at it's core, so this is something that should also plague and bot.  So what types of remediation do you guys use for accounting for this.  I guess you could just choose a steady equity with less chop, but for those who trade momentum on higher volatility equities, what have you found that works?

Thanks in advance for any conversation around this!  I really appreciate this community, and I love when there is good debate on techniques.  

Cheers!",nkxtug,[],1
