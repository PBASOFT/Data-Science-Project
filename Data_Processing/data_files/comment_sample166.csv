You‚Äôll do better buying and holding for most of your portfolio unless you really know what you‚Äôre doing (I don‚Äôt mean you did your homework and watched some videos or whatever, I mean you have a lot of experience)

That said I think everyone should have a small amount to play with to help them learn, keep themselves interested while reading up on companies and markets etc. as long as you‚Äôre okay with losing whatever that play money amount is.

Legit answer though is to uphold the integrity of the market. More people day trading means more daily volume, and more volatility, plain and simple. Just look at the crazy volumes of meme stocks and how wild the valuations get. Super cool to watch and take part in. Not so great if that happened across the board to every stock.

206,gz97mj0,2021-05-24,t3_njmeaw,stocks,"I have those that I invest and those that I trade.

Those that are trade I don't view as stock/company, but as value. Meaning stop loss and take profit when I open the trade. Take profit is 1.5x what I have as stop loss, but if I notice a heavy sentiment on social media/news for the stock then I remove it and instead change the stop loss to the positive.

Example:
Stock bought at 10$, stop loss at 9$ and take profit at 11.5$. Stock reaches 11$ and I see a heavy positive sentiment, I remove the stop loss and watch it closely. When it reaches 11.5$ I now put a stop loss at 11$. Take profit usually happens manually here since it's a special case.

For investing I don't care what happens price wise, I didn't realize that for a while but the mindset is similar to Cathies investing strategy. She doesn't care at what price to buy in, she just wants to be in. And as long as no fundamentals that I determine as my own fundamentals changed I keep adding to the position unless I find something new and better. But I keep the position regardless.

The only time I sell an investment is when something majorly changes, like company structure or plan or environment for the company. Of course only if it's negative enough to actually sell anything.

They *can* talk about what they think about gamestop if you initiate the conversation. At least mine did. 

Short version - 

February -  Called wrinkle brain advisor to move part of IRA into GME. WBA said ""that might be a risky move, but ok"". 

April - Found old forgotten 401k and rolled to Wells Fargo, but the entire balance on GME. WBA said, ""You know, this GME is interesting. I've never seen a negative beta before. Could be a good hedge against market volatility. It seems like the new execs are building a solid company. We're definitely paying attention.""

May - WBA (who is also my father's advisor) tells my dad ""You might want to talk to your Ape about this stock. There may be something to it."" Dad puts small portion of portfolio into GME ""just in case"". 

&#x200B;

Speculation - WellsFargo Advisors can talk about their thoughts on GME if you bring it up, but they can't recommend it outright.

446,gz9t1yp,2021-05-24,t3_njm5y9,stocks,"Are you in the USA or somewhere else like in Europe? In the USA, you can sign up with E*Trade, Interactive Brokers, Schwab etc. etc. or you can get an account with Fidelity or Vanguard. All these allow you to invest in US total market or SP500 index funds without transaction fees.

It sounds to me like you are relatively young and also based on the other things you said, I think you should just keep saving and investing in low cost index funds in a temporally diversified manner (dollar cost averaging). Think about it like this: if you intend to keep investing for a long time, then the amount that you will buy in the future will be much greater than what you have so far. So your current portfolio will in the end be less than 10% of your total portfolio in the end (when you're 60+ or whatever). So it really doesn't matter in the long run even if the market crashes from here and stays low for 10 or even 20 years, as long as you stay employed and retain purchasing power to keep buying stocks (also just imagine how much you'd end up earning in dividends alone in a scenario like this).

So that's the baseline. From here, if you want to do anything, I would say start learning (and I mean seriously learning) about investing in stocks. I recommend index funds, but you need to get it out of your head that only ""smart professionals"" can make intelligent investments in individual stocks. This topic has been discussed extensively on this forum and elsewhere, but let me just mention that it has been shown that just by mechanically copying Berkshire Hathaway 13Fs and equally weighting their public stock portfolio investments, you would have beaten the SP500 over time. So it is not impossible. In fact it's simple, but it's not easy and your own knowledge of investing and about yourself and your own psychology will be key here.

To summarize: don't sell. If you don't know anything, buy total market / large cap index funds in a temporally distributed manner. If you want to do better, start learning and studying investment and accept that this will take years (or longer) but that is fine because while you learn, you can keep sitting on your index fund investments.",[],1

In summary - get busy with life. So busy with kids and work and the duties of maintaining a household that you don‚Äôt check your portfolio daily, sometimes not even monthly. 

You‚Äôll miss a lot of newsworthy events, and you‚Äôll look back and know if you were paying closer attention you could have entered or exited a position at a really great time. But you‚Äôll also observe that your balances grow. And you‚Äôll continue to add money regularly because that‚Äôs the discipline you‚Äôve developed over decades of life. 

Occasionally you‚Äôll have some downtime from life and you‚Äôll jump in to optimize your portfolio, sticking to a strategy rather than a ticker. You‚Äôll sell a good company whose stock has done well for you in order to buy a better company whose stock will also do well. You‚Äôll wish you could afford both, but you‚Äôll understand that no one can own everything they want, even the richest of the rich, so you accept that ‚Äúchoosing is refusing‚Äù and you don‚Äôt let it bother you that all choices have inherent opportunity costs. 

The first half-million is the hardest to get. From there the snowball picks up steam and you can see weekly swings (when you‚Äôre watching) that exceed your annual salary when you were broke and in college. Then one day you‚Äôll pay annual taxes that exceed your salary when you were broke and in college. Then you‚Äôll understand how these numbers are all relative to your stage of life and how ‚Äúbeing rich‚Äù isn‚Äôt what you thought. It seems like ‚Äúrich‚Äù is always more than what I‚Äôve accumulated. 

But I‚Äôm ‚Äúrich‚Äù compared to my 20-year-old self for sure. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what you make, it‚Äôs what you keep.‚Äù

However - if you make and keep a lot and simply hold onto it, your account balance grows but you‚Äôll look around and see that you‚Äôre solidly middle class.

720,gza5rv2,2021-05-24,t3_njmeaw,stocks,"I started actually getting into stock stuff this year; up until then I just put money into SPY in an ira I had through my company and thought nothing of it.

I went from ""I don't even look at the market, I just buy SPY when I can"" to manically checking the price of a stock over and over again. I lost roughly $650 chasing trends, had a few days where I felt sick watching money evaporate, and changed my course after a week. I think I have a better relationship with stocks/investments now; I took up blue-chip buy and hold investing, with a focus on dividends and compounding interest, here's a list of all the things I've changed my outlook on, or learned, in the past few months:

1) every penny in the market is ""lost"", I'll never see it again; I don't expect my investments to fail, per say, but I do only invest what I can stomach never using again. Especially this for the fact that I'm expecting to eventually subsist off dividends alone, I don't expect to ever sell what I've bought unless they cut or stop paying a dividend entirely, so that money really will never go back to me in theory.

2) green days are nice, but red days are better. Since I'm buying as holding for the long run, a stock going down in value isn't the worst thing ever; I get to look at the news around why is dropping, if the news is insignificant and the drop seems to be driven by FUD, it let's me buy the stock at a lower price. If there's actually a good reason for the price to drop, it let's me evaluate the stock to see if I want to bounce or not.

3) look at overall values, not day to day. Today a stock investment of mine is down by about 3 dollars, but the total value is up by around 70 dollars. Temporary dips are fine, and worrying about them is foolish.

4) take comfort in an entire market crash; a week or so ago we had a huge correction in the market, I lost a lot of my unrealized gains from it, but I was fine with it. If 1 stock goes down you might worry that it's a bad play. If every stock, either in a sector or across sectors, goes down? That's just a crash, it's not based on fundamentals changing, or problems with my stocks' company, or anything that justifies the stock losing value, it's just a sale.

5) pay attention to the news, but only act on the important stuff. All the previous rules rely on this, if I hear JNJ comes out and says ""it turns out our products cause mega death cancer and also our CEO kicks puppies and orphans for fun. We refuse to apologize and will continue to do this."" That might be a good time to sell; the red day isn't just a regular dip, the fundamentals I trusted changed, the overall values are now important to pay attention to too see the reaction, it's different now, so it's fine to act on it. If you see class action lawsuits or a pipeline gets shafted during planning or some controversy about a training video circulates, it'll be a blip on the company, so don't sweat it. Don't worry about the small stuff, just act on the big issues.",[],0

You are missing a very key phrase here: **If nothing else goes wrong**

Yes, if nothing else goes wrong the airlines will likely limp along for the next few years and perhaps even start paying back some of the massive amounts of debt that they have accumulated.  The airline industry has been notoriously vulnerable to world events, and they seem to get hit by a bad large scale event every 10 years or so. There are even much more frequent minor events like plane crashes and strikes that can affect their bottom line significantly. There are dozens of things outside of their control that could happen to hurt the airlines industry and very few windfall scenarios that could happen that would actually help them.

Another important fact that I found when digging into their financials is that Delta Airlines book value right now is close to **ZERO**. That means that their liabilities are roughly equal to their assets. If anything goes wrong to tip them off the razors edge that they are balancing on to return to profitability, their creditors are going to come calling. In a best case scenario the shareholders are going to get diluted, in a worst case scenario they could be wiped out.

The final nail in the coffin for airlines at their current valuations is to look at the return on investment potential for these stocks. Even if they were to go back to pre-pandemic levels of business (which is no guarantee) and interest rates stay low, they are looking at much dimmer outlooks because of all the interest they will be paying on the giant piles of debt that they were forced to take on.  Debt isn't necessarily a bad thing when it is being used to expand, but when it has been used just to survive that is a lead anchor that is going to weigh on these stocks for years to come.  Many companies in the past have limped along for decades under large burdens of debt, only to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy during the next big recession.

Even in a best case scenario, the airlines are looking at 5-10 years of pre-pandemic level profits just to repay the debt that they took on in the last year. That is 5-10 years of operating fiscally responsibly with nothing going wrong before an airline can start returning value to its shareholders in the form of dividends or share buybacks. Hopefully nothing goes wrong in that time, because if it does shareholders are going to be the ones feeling the pain.

What I'm trying to say here is that there is a lot of risk (both known and unknown) still associated with airline stocks, and the potential upside/reward is not nearly enough to justify that risk. There are much safer companies to invest in to get similar or better returns than we might expect from an airline company operating in optimal conditions, so there is literally zero reason to throw money at an airline company that has a much higher risk profile.",[],0

785,gza9iau,2021-05-24,t1_gza60ne,stocks,"Pretty much everything I've done DD on for them has just been looking up articles and reading up on graphite. I know their biggest backer is The Pallinghurst Group, and their biggest hurdle to production in Canada was achieving a permit for mining which they got a few months back. The Canadian Government have also expressed support for them as well.

My understanding is that something like 90% of the world's graphite currently comes from China but with NMG being based in Canada they would be a far more reliable and affordable alternative to auto-makers in NA. Anodes are one of the four main components of lithium-ion batteries and are made with graphite, and NMG serves not just as a mine for graphite but also a production factory for the anodes specifically for use in lithium ion batteries. 

They have a youtube channel that they have put out a handful of advertisement videos on which are pretty funny and kind of show off the culture/humor that the team in charge has. While I've never contacted them myself my understanding is that the CEO and a few others engage with people on twitter and investor meetings.

They were an OTC stock for a long while until recently, and they just went through a reverse-split which scared a bunch of people away and tanked the price for a while. It was a 10-1 spilt when they were around $1.70/share, and after the split it dropped to as low as $10/share until recovering recently to get back up around $16 before today. I believe the highest I've ever seen it was around $2.05/$2.10 before the split shortly after the permit announcement.

People also point out that technology is changing and the graphite part of lithium-ion batteries, or lithium-ion in their entirety, might change over the next ten years, but the CEO has ensured they have taken such things into account. I also believe there were some protests after they got their permit from a local tribe or something but my understanding is that the tribe doesn't actually live anywhere close to the mining site itself and NMG has been very open and accommodating to them, even offering them employment.

Full disclosure I am pretty new at the stock thing and NMG are the first company I ever really did DD on, and they seem like a pretty good bet and I just got lucky, even if I don't have a huge position in them or anything, at least relative to the kind of numbers I've seen thrown around elsewhere. 

TL;DR, they are basically the number one player in a growing market and offer far more accessibility to that market than the main players in it now. They also market themselves really well and seem to have good people up and down throughout their company. The drawbacks would be jumping in on a stock that is so fresh to a major exchange and still two years or so away from reaching full production, and potential technological changes that might effect their future. 

I'd suggest you check out some of their marketing videos on youtube, even if you decide not to invest you may at least get a laugh out of it!",[],1

Its not to say that accredited investors and institutions can take those impacts and we don‚Äôt care about them, but in terms of order of magnitude small investors get hurt more. 

Furthermore, given the larger number of users and their impact on the market, in the short run they can cause higher variances while still smoothing out the variances in the long run. i.e. lots of noise when zooming into hours/minutes/seconds. Think flash crashes, etc. on the long run the big investors smooth out the economy by providing liquidity to the market. Unfortunately the small investor cant recover when theyre margin called and dont have funding to support. 

Now given what happened during the Great Depression and other key financial oopsies, with the group hurt the most being the small investor, laws were put in place to protect them. They supply a different form of liquidity and we dont/cant lose that. 

In the end the small investor is the supplier of cash and demand of loans. Institutions supply loans using supplier cash. If one side freezes so does the other. One can weather the storm longer than the other. 

Smaller exchanges/markets dont have that same level of total economic impact. Its not as much of a dent to the economy (world wide mind you) when canadian markets (only as an example) sees problems. If us markets freeze, well, we know what happens then.",[],0

Random stuff. Penny stocks, raw materials, tech, pharma, retail, etc...a bunch of random stuff to see what sticks.

I play with this stuff to just keep a pulse on the market (not beat the S&P or make quick cash).

Thing is...wealth management is much different than trading. Trading is for people who like to gamble with informed opinions. Wealth management is where your serious money goes, free from emotion, free from mood swings, and free from bear and bull years. People don't like to mention DCA. But if you want to grow wealth, then DCA, regardless of market activity. Buy at the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. Doesn't matter. Buy without fault every month. Don't try to time the market. Don't even look at prices. Just focus on consistent and dedicated investing through thick and thin. DCA takes all the emotion out. It doesn't care about what the price of a stock is at any given moment. What it cares about is how many shares you've bought over 30-40 years. If you buy during bears and bulls, you'll average out and you'll have performed dead center with how the market has performed over the last 100 years.

I play woth stocks to keep a pulse on the market and it can be fun. I don't play to make money. That's where serious money through DCA over 30 years will land me. And that stuff is off limits to ""speculative trading.""",[],1
