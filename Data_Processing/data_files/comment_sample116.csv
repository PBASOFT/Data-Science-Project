Now, there is a big caveat to that. The 5 dollars a share is reasonable if they are at their best profit and revenue levels ever. 5 dollars a share is justified if that is the case, 9therwise 5 a share is OVERVALUED


Ok real talk. Please do a lot of research before actively trading. Claiming that it is undervalued based on its volume is similar to me saying airplanes fly because sometimes there is a blue suitcase on the plane. May get lucky with amc, but eventually it will catch up to you.

AMC current shares outstanding is 400 million shares.  That is the listed amount of shares that the company is recorded number of shares.  The recent share dilution that AA put into the market was only 47 million.  That is only 10 percent.

When you realize that on an average day AMC trades 90 million shares.  40 million is nothing.

So, I am not sure how you are getting these insane levels of dilution.  Unless you are talking about illegal shares that have been put into the market.  Shares that are not supposed to exist.  If anything if the value of the stock is only at 12 dollars with all of these unregulated shares.  Then the price is at least double the current price.  Because those shares are not shares put into the market by the company.

The validity of a perception is irrelevant as long as it is widely held. 

For example, there wasn’t a toilet paper shortage in 2020 until the fear-created perception/anticipation of one caused some hoarding, which caused shortages, which perpetuated more hoarding, which…

How can a crypto worth X today and 2X tomorrow? Or .5X? What changed? 

Perception. The basis of demand.

We’re due for some inflation. 

For better of worse, the Fed created excess demand in fixed income markets through QE years back, and again through current unlimited support during COVID. 

That excess demand increased fixed income prices, decreased yields, and drove investment capital into the equities markets, spreading the inflation around. 

The OP is convinced that the coming inflation will be bad. Maybe he’s right. Maybe he’s wrong. Maybe he used the wrong words. 

What matters is how the US handles unwinding its investments the fixed income markets. 

The future is not clear. 

One possible outcome/risk is that, along the way, the Fed may create another Taper Tantrum, or cause precipitously falling bond prices, and then react by returning/retreating to the “proven” policy of the snake eating its tail — printing more $ to prop things up by buying its own (and other) issuances. 

In that event, the perception of an overly leveraged nation and its politicized central bank recklessly devaluing its currency through spiraling QE could become dangerous. 

The probability of that outcome is certainly debatable.",[],0

When SPY price is below 20-day SMMA you are again calling it support 

Question? 

**What is a support actually? If SP break some line and stay above that line? If don't stay above that line that's also support. What is resistance then? Based on your argument you can call any line above or below as support. Even when SP goes up and down above and below that line multiple times. You are now completely changing the meaning of support.**    

You are saying at higher prices such as 419, 420, 422 you are bullish but you do understand that price goes higher when demand is more than supply, right? You also understand that if price goes up then RSI will also goes up, right? 

Now question.

**Next Monday if SPY goes to $419.7 and RSI goes to 82. Now you are in bullish territory based of SPY price but RSI is indicating over bought. Will you buy call or puts? Because whatever you buy you will contradict yourself.**

Same goes if SPY drops to $408 and RSI also goes to oversold territory. 

Also, you will see that price goes up or down slowly without disturbing RSI significantly and then suddenly change direction when RSI is barely 40 or 60 (in your graph). 

What period you used to calculate RSI in that chart? I can show that SPY was never overbought or never oversold on Friday just by changing the parameters.

You actually proved nothing here. I asked you some simple questions several times. You never answered them. You wrote a post here but still did not answer my questions.

Good grades=opportunities later in life (maybe even after 10 years, you will be grateful for the hustle)

Don’t chase the money. Money chasing makes people emotional and attached.
None makes profits when emotional and attached, but everyone looses money. 


Learn to control your emotions and ego.
Master them if you can.

Go long on your play. Better have 500000 in 5 years than “maybe” 40000 by September. 
Monazite what you offer to the world, but offer something that is needed. 


Set incremental small goals to achieve.
Don’t overwhelm your self with high goals to hit. 


I don’t know you, you might be able to get to a mil by September, but all i know is that when you do the above, people will keep coming and keep giving you more opportunities (eventually more money).

Get rid of any loans etc that you might have. Even if its a five dollar loan. 


Some might not agree, but i think we need more young brains in, than more money in. If you get what I’m saying.

But, even then it doesn't really matter. If you look at January 27th it traded 1.2 billion shares.  So, I mean maybe you in the past the volume has changed.  But, in the past when it's volume was lower did it trade 1.2 billion shares in one day.

So, I mean I see your argument.  But, it has also increased it's holdings in tangible assets like land and infrastructure.  For some reason it is trading 1.2 billion shares in a day.  It also has 3.5 million individual share holders.

This is a SPAC bankrolled company with a junior exec at the head of the company.  He does not have the experience to listen to good advice when times get tough.   And the SPAC guys have built up his ego.  He needs to fail to learn.

The long term tend for this stock is down.  Lower lows. These temporary up trends are just that folks who think they found a value stock and buy.  And the sheep keep following...until it is too late to see the clif.

I am not saying this is a bad buy over the long term. I am saying it is too soon too buy.  I am saying that there are less risky alternatives.  The mortgage market is at a peak or past it.  It all depends on the recovery and feeding the market more low interest cash.  And this stock is all about mortgages.  And making money off of fees.  Let me be the one to remind folks about the last crazy in the mortgage market...AIG, CountryWide, CDOs, Wells Fargo.  Do not put your hard earned cash into this stock.  It does not have a track record that indicates it is a growth stock with a moat.

This is mostly due to the structure of PSTH, investors get 2 free warrants for every 9 shares they hold through merger which ends up rewarding people who hold long, it also allows current investors the opportunity to purchase PSTH 2 at nav which is basically guaranteed free money if PSTH ends up being a hit. 

Furthermore, the only thing Bill gets out of this entire ordeal are warrants exercisable 3 years after the merger date, not to mention he will be investing a billion dollars of his funds money into the SPAC as well which offers a level of insurance that he will bring a good company at a good valuation public.

Volume is totally irrelevant to valuation. There is no reason to discuss that at all.

You're right, there are additional forces at play. Did AMC purchase or open more locations after the pandemic started? If so, that is relevant. If acquisitions were prior to the pandemic then they arent, as the market had determine that AMC isn't worth more than 5 a share with those holdings.

Now, AMC took out an absurd amount of debt to stay solvent during the pandemic. Did they pay that off with the stock offering? It's feasible, but I don't think they did. I think they just paid a portion off - this pushes it further below the 5 dollars a share level. 

The biggest issue though, is that it is looking like movie theaters may never recover to pre pandemic levels. That is devastating for obvious reasons. Especially since they need to double or triple profits to make current share prices reasonable.

AMC can still be a good trade. I bought 2k shares the week before last and may again this week. As a company though, the share price is trading at a massive premium, eventually it will come back to earth. You can potentially make lots of money on it, but not as a buy and hold investment for the above reason",['AMC'],0

Your logic is FUD.

You think movie theaters are not going to recover.  That is FUD.  Anyone that says that is just spreading FUD.

I am not clicking on ycharts I have never heard of that site it is probably a virus.  Because the only message you have is FUD.

How can you think Movie theaters are never going to recover.  They are lifting mask mandates and no one I speak to even cares about this damn virus anymore.  People love going to the Movies.  Why would movies not recover.  Are you trying to say that people dont want to go to the movies.  At home experiences are not better than they were pre pandemic.  2019 was not that long ago.

The biggest issue is the Fed…keeping emergency policy going almost 15 years after the emergency.

Now, the market is totally addicted to the Fed’s ultra low rates and even normal inflation puts the Fed in a corner.

The Fed is terrified of raising rates…they won’t even discuss tapering the $120B per month they buy in bonds/mortgage debt.

$120B per month…$1.44T per year.

I hang with a small circle and I don’t have any issues with being around others that drink.  I’ve gone out to the bar a handful of times with friends but it’s really not my scene anymore.  Just about every relationship or hookup I’ve ever had started at the bar or with alcohol involved.  Last weekend I got a booty call from a former FWB that I used to drink a lot with and hookup.  She texted at around midnight right as I was heading to bed.  She was at the bar and I told her she could stop by and she said it wouldn’t be until around 2.  I really thought about it and although it has been 2 years I didn’t want to sit around for 2 hours and wait for her to show up if she even did.

2200,gz4qhhj,2021-05-23,t1_gz4psdd,wallstreetbets,"In an interview with Platts in March, Tellurian CEO said the company plans to produce all the natural gas it will need to feed Driftwood and would not sanction the up to 27 million mt/year liquefaction project until it had secured sufficient upstream reserves for the 16 million mt/year first phase. Though it currently has a small acreage position in the Haynesville, Tellurian is looking to grow. 

It resumed its drilling program by spudding a new well April 25.

During the Citi conference, Souki suggested that Tellurian's commercial efforts were the company's focus in the near-term. In the Platts interview afterward, he said expanding Tellurian's upstream gas reserves would be more of a focus after the commercial agreements are in place.

""Whether we will need to get them all or some before we issue notice to proceed or not we haven't decided,"" Souki said, referring to the upstream reserves.

The upstream move is necessary to make feasible Tellurian's offering that it launched earlier this year of 10 million mt/year of Driftwood marketing volumes for a 10-year term for the price of the monthly Platts JKM assessment or Dutch TTF index, minus the cost of shipping. By eliminating the US Henry Hub gas price from the equation, Tellurian hopes to alleviate one measure of volatility that has so far prevented it and many of its North American competitors from building.

In the interview, Souki said the offering has been very popular and, if Tellurian hits its target in the next few weeks, would be oversubscribed.",[],1

Since the price moves up and down - support and resistance are fluid - especially with short term trends -  support can become resistance and resistance can become support. Supports and resistances are best used for determining your enter and exit points - to help you strategies your moves for the day. 

**What is a support actually? If SP break some line and stay above that line? If don't stay above that line that's also support? What is resistance then? Based on your argument you can call any line above or below as support. Even when SP goes up and down above and below that line multiple times. You are now completely changing the meaning of support.**

Note: This is just talking about the 5m timeframe. Your SMMAs are going to be different on longer timeframes. This is why using multiple timeframes is very important in determining mid-term and long-term trends (with long-term trends this is why you hear ""stonks only go up"".) Look at spy longterm - it only goes up. 

The strength of a support is determined  by how many times the prices ""bounces off it""  Same for the strength of a resistance. I pointed out that the 20 smma was a good support indicator on 5/20 since it bounced off it a few times throughout the day. This indicated that the bulls were in charge for the day - notice the strong uptrend by how far spread out your 20, 60, and 120 SMMAs are?

When the price consolidates around an SMMA it means that there is a battle and a possible reversal may take place. For example, if in a downtrend - bulls need to increase buying pressure to have a reversal. 

Notice how we had that blow-off top at around 418 and had a very bearish engulfing candle throw us back down into the 417-418 resistance range? That told me that there was a good chance that we were going to test the 20 SMMA for support. 

If support held, we may see a reversal back up to 418 but if it failed then watch out. So, look at the battle that took place and notice that the price moved in and out of the 20 SMMA. The price essentially consolidated. And remember the definition of consolidation: ""Consolidation is the term for a stock or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. Consolidated stocks typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few trading opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

Here is the consolidation I'm talking about: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uZCZcYcZ/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uZCZcYcZ/)

Bulls and bears are battling. Once we broke out of that consolidation range. The bears gained the 20 SMMA as resistance and were now in control until the bulls found support at the 120 SMMA.  

**You are saying at higher prices such as 419, 420, 422 you are bullish but you do understand that price goes higher when demand is more than supply, right? You also understand that if price goes up then RSI will also goes up, right? Which means RSI can go to overbought territory.**

I provide bullish and bearish price targets for the day. This means that I'm trimming or taking profits if we hit those levels. I will also take profit if we are near a highlighted resistance or support level. Especially if indicators are telling me that we are overbought or oversold. If we break through resistance and find support on top of that resistance line then I'll enter back in. Inverse if bear.  

Yes. I know that RSI can go past 70. It all depends on risk management. If i'm playing 0dte and we are near oversold or overbought I will secure profits. I got kids to feed friend :) 

**Next Monday if SPY goes to $419.7 and RSI goes to 82. Now you are in bullish territory based of SPY price but RSI is indicating over bought. Will you buy call or puts? Because whatever you buy you will contradict yourself.**

I would have already taken profit since it hit a bullish price target. Then i'll reassess  and determine my next play based on current trend and indicators. 

Truthfully, I i make a good play and make good money I'll be done for the day and wait for the market to close to analyze and strategies my next moves for the next day. 

**What period you used to calculate RSI in that chart? I can show that SPY was never overbought or never oversold on Friday just by changing the parameters.**

**You actually proved nothing here. I asked you some simple questions several times. You never answered them. You wrote a post here but still did not answer my questions.**

I don't know how else to talk to someone like you if you don't think I answered any of your questions. I'm also not going to spend half my night trying to teach someone TA when you could watch a youtube video or read a book. 

**Drawing colorful lines using a trading software doesn't make you an expert if you can't even define what is ""support"". Stock price goes above a line and stay there few moment and goes below that line and stay there sometimes. That line is anything but ""support""**

Frankly, I also agree with you about trading options in general. It's important to understand that while stocks can rise across the board in the long run, and most people can ""win"", options really have a 50/50 split (at BEST). It's frankly a gamble in a lot of regards. They may be useful as a risk management tool, for complex investors who use them to hedge, but they seldom make sense as a form of jacking up risk for the average investor. Every option trade has an equal distribution (at best) on both sides of the trade. What I mean by that, is that if you have a 90% chance of a 10% return on one side of the trade, well then you're going to have a 10% of a 100% loss on the other side, to balance things out. There's no free money in options trades.

If you buy Amazon and I buy Johnson and Johnson, we could both make money and both come out ahead. But if there's a Yankees v. Sox game, and I pick Yankees, and you pick Sox, one of us wins and the other one has to lose. We can't both win. If the Yankees are the favorite, then I may be more likely to win, but win less money, and you'd be less likely to win, but you'd have a bigger payout if you did. In the same regard, options trades must balance, and there's a winner and a loser every time.",[],0

I just DM'd them about the sponsorship thing cuz it's a great point, and their response was that they are effectively creating and curating a verifiably-amateur pool of talent, and that the viewer demo of gamers is the most sought after demo by advertisers today. So GameStake is evidently going to 'auction off' real-estate on shirts and stickers to be placed on the side of headsets (he didn't mention it, but I wouldn't be surprised if they also did streaming watermarks), to brands.

I'm also curious why a player would simply stream his/herself, but apparently players and teams who list on their platform are also given access to benefits normally only seen in professional franchises (coaching, highlight editing, etc.), so they're not only fostering talent improvement but making these players more marketable.

It's basically the border between Minnesota and Canada. It's absolutely gorgeous highly recommend anybody that's interested in nature go spend some time up there. But I kept hearing these weird stories from people and teachers that used to guide the trip about weird stuff that would happen up there. I blew it off as people don't understand what the real outdoor sounds like or looks like at night whatever. Well one night we were all sitting by the fire the clouds were low it was a quiet night not too much going on. Until we all looked up and we're watching The Stars through the clouds when we saw a light pass under the cloud layer really quick and not really in a straight line. A couple of us saw it and we all just kind of glance at each other didn't really say anything laughed about it nervously and stayed quiet the rest of the night.

Due to the reasons you listed and probably the fact that it established itself as so over the years, is why it still is after the US dollar becoming fiat.

  
I don't see how increased supply is not a convincing argument, scarcity can create value for something. But I suppose as long as it managed, it's fine. 1.8%  yearly typically, as you noted. Inflation is a loss of purchasing power by definition. I don't see why one wouldn't be able to apply supply and demand to the currency itself, even if economist don't agree on how to measure it.

  
But I just wanted to note. We didn't become the worlds reserve currency being a fiat currency.

  
If they were to meet back in the past, obviously the US would never have become the world reserve currency without being a hard currency tied to gold and or silver. Being the world reserve currency gives us some resistance against hyperinflation.

  
If people were to meet up today and decide on a global reserve currency. I could see that currency being fiat. People think differently today. Note the bias towards fiat currency being good.

  
I imagine there are pros and cons to fiat and hard based currency.",[],1

This leaves a need for an alternative store of value. Crypto has not sufficiently matured although I do think that in 20 years it will fill that role, specifically bitcoin.

I suppose by the transitive property, you could say rich families own private banks, and private banks are members of the fed, and therefore rich families own the fed.

Is the fed corrupt, idk. But it's creation was certainly done in a secret manner. Passed when a lot of congress was on vacation in 1913, and drafted in relative secret by major banking families. They met at Jekyll Island.

There certainly is a Rothschild connection. As a banking family. Banks control money flow. How nefarious this is, is up you to decide. It is somewhat natural for a bank to think about wanting a national bank. But a foreign bank?

I'm personally not fond of the manner I hear the federal reserve was created. But if you insist on the current economic system, you need a national bank. Is this the fed? Currently yes. Could it be done better? idk. Are there other systems, sure. Are they better, idk, maybe.

You could get lucky for sure, or you could sit with that one stock for months losing whatever you are paying in interest on that loan. Depending on your employment, credit score, assets, etc. you interest rate could be as high as 30%.

4711,gz5cev7,2021-05-23,t3_niwtp2,wallstreetbets,"FYI - The only catalyst for TELL to have a meaningful and sustained increase in value is a positive Final Investment Decision (FID).  Without FID, Driftwood LNG doesn't get built, and all TELL shareholders get burned.

Gas liquefaction plants are enormously expensive (multi-billion dollar) capital projects that almost always go over budget and past their scheduled completion dates.  So funding their design and construction is very difficult if the owner isnt already a massive O&G company like ExxonMobil, Shell, or Total.  Without FID, an LNG export plant is little more than an idea.

Search for FID for Driftwood and  other proposed LNG terminals such as PNG LNG, Magnolia, Jordan Cove, Goldboro, Costa Azul, Plaquemines, Port Arthur, etc.  What you'll see is how the planned FID dates continually get pushed back...next quarter, next year, etc.  Without that FID greenlight, they are stuck.

Mozambique LNG took FID in 2018 and Golden Pass took FID in Feb 2019...and despite the O&G biz being hit terribly hard during COVID, (and Moz LNG being hit by just about every other kind of bad news under the sun) those are still grinding forward because the investment decision was fully authorized and spend committed when FID was announced.
 
Be wary of Driftwood's claims about anything other than a positive FID announcement - it remains quite speculative until then.  The one thing that truly separates TELL from most other proposed LNG terminals, though, is their mgmt team...Souki and his team have actually brought two liquefaction plants from concept through funding and regulatory approval to construction and  operations.  The only other recent pure-play US LNG company to have done so is Venture Global.  So perhaps with TELL it's a matter of when it will move forward, not if it will...but it is still VERY risky until they announce FID.

Fortunately, there were German Reich silver coins at that time, these have saved the lives of thousands of Germans because otherwise you could not have bought anything to eat. My grandfather then buried a heavy zinc box full of silver coins of the German Reich in the barn or on our property together with Wehrmacht pistols to hide them from the Americans. My grandfather took his stash to his grave, unfortunately my father never found the box. But he always gave me the advice that real money is only gold and silver.

Back then, I didn't read articles and only traded on price action.  I saw Nantkwest (NK) go from like 4 bucks to 8 bucks a share in like half an hour.  I started shorting because it got parabolic.  Then it halted and opened up high.  I panicked and sold for a 18K loss.  The trade was correct but took a loss due to the panic caused by the halt.  Then I read about the company that day and the owner on bloomberg said he basically cured someone with stage 4 pancreatic cancer.  My friend's dad died of pancreatic canceer.  It's a death sentence.  I was shocked.  Who has stage 4 pancreatic cancer and gets cured?  Wtf.  Lol.

People in USA don't seem to have slowed spending, AND have on average more savings.

But this is just my reading of what's happening. I expect Biden has to get his package through and running pretty fast to prove to folk it's viable and moving, because he doesn't have a big majority, & needs to convince the USA it is working before mid term, I think.

We saw a slight bump in spending due to short term stimmy checks and bottlenecks on the global supply chains creating artificial supply shortages. This led to a temporary bump in prices across a lot of sectors..

Now onto the second and larger point. Everyone seems to think that because in their Econ 101 course that low interest rates eventually causes inflation. This was true up until the late 70s in the US when wealth inequality was still fairly low. Now we live in a new paradigm of wealth inequality. Since the 80s both interest rates and inflation rates have been declining - I will gladly provide links but also feel free to see the data for yourself. This is because despite money lending getting easier and easier, we have massive concentrations of wealth, so all this new money is going into fewer and fewer hands. You can’t raise prices across the board for goods when the average person doesn’t have more money to spend. It did happen the last couple quarters but again that’s because of stimmy’s and unemployment benefits. 

We must keep interest rates low until unemployment fully recovers. Wealth has still yet to trickle down because trickle down barely works. Most at the top are good at plugging up all the leaks. 

But lastly, even if all y’all’s inflation fears are true, aren’t stocks one of the best assets to have during those times? Cash becomes useless, bonds go nowhere, stonks ride inflation to the moon. So TLDR : inflation isn’t happening, but even if it is, keep investing in stonks.",[],0

Most of silver is mined as a by-product of other mined materials, with a commodities boom going on, there will be lots of silver coming down the pipe. The dealer premiums are funny, they charge way over spot, but buy at or under.... further this kind of dealer disconnect happened in 2011. It ended in tears when silver free fell from $50.

We have both going on.  Stimulus checks have built a surplus of money in many households and velocity is currently low and about to head higher and the government is printing money out of thin air to pay for things that it truly can't afford.

my the first post in this thread regarding charts. I am legit losing braincells fighting this kind of weaponized retardation. January of this year we were at $2. Then came the GME squeeze and AMC squeezed with it. After that it dropped to as low as $5 and sat there for awhile, but STILL it was up from the $2 earlier in the year. Then you can clearly see a uptrend for AMC to the price it is at now, with a very nice support level at $12 currently. 

Like how is this hard to process? Even a fucking 5 year old can clearly see the diffrence of AMC january 1s 2021 to AMC may 23 2021. Honestly, what the fuck other chart do you think im referring to?????","['GME', 'AMC']",0

So current SPY price is 415. If it looks bullish ill play a 415c and look at trimming at the 418 resistance and leave a few runners if SPY can push to that 419 bullish pt.  

I hope this answers your question.",[],1

Comparing the dollar against silver is exactly the fault of inflation modern economists try to avoid. Silver is now a commodity, bought and sold, so its price will vary with that. If tomorrow scientists find silver can cure cancer, its price will skyrocket via utility increase, but that doesn't mean the US dollar has lost significant value overnight. Real estate has similarly shot up in value since the 1960's, but even if the US dollar were originally backed by land (""One dollar for one acre of land!""), we wouldn't measure today's purchasing power to real estate. When using the word inflation, it's proper to treat it as the scientific term it is, and not some stand-in for a commodity's price going up.

To bring in the WSB angle, yes, people can still make money off of inflation-resistant goods like gold and silver. Someone who YOLO'd into silver in 1960 probably would be pretty rich today. That's a solid investment strategy, but a 60-year hold doesn't strike me as WSB's modus operandi. And since hyperinflation is not right around the corner, it's unlikely people will make significant money overnight (unless other people buy it because they also believe gold will spike, but that's a different story with different game theory).",[],1

I said yep let's do this and transferred $10k in. The frustrating thing was buying around 200 shares of GME with a cost basis of $48 and then selling at $75 I think instead of holding for the insanity that would transpire that night in after hours.

I don't agree with giving Israel or Iran plane loads of cash for other reasons but we did scoot cash out of our economy via all this nation building bullshit.  We don't mind proxy wars because it shows others that the Dollar is still Supreme due to our armed forces (hence why they get the lions share of the budget every year) and we can funnel some excess cash out of the country and actually keep the value of our currency up, abroad. 

People worry about China having some of our debt. It is concerning but they cannot do much because if they default and we crash their economy will crash and burn quicker. So they're invested in the Dollar even if it doesn't have the intrinsic value it has tons of extrinsic value.

Housing prices versus inflation. Home ownership rate versus housing supply, and housing availability.

Sign of how close we are to this burst: housing prices went up by 5% in the last *week*.

Which means that this company is making money today off of a market that's about to see the value of its assets get the axe. This is literally the top, or close to it.

RKT and UWMC's similarities or dissimilarities are completely irrelevant. RKT is also a bland mortgage company. Its jump had everything to do with option mispricing and two squeezes.

2. People were betting against and for the completion of the flight. Nobody can predict the outcome of a successful test flight. Thus is not a sell the news event because the “news” could have gone either way. It’s like when you bet on a baseball team to win. You don’t know if the team will win or not.

3. Those in the know on VG know that they will be conducting several more test flights over the summer. The final one with Richard Branson, the real money honeypot. Envision every test flight as a step of stairs. After this flight it will stabilize somewhere. Before the next one it will stabilize somewhere and move up before the flight as people place their bets. Just like this time. It can go either way, hell, if there is a catastrophe the stock could plummet to 0 which makes it so lucrative for the shorts.

2. People were betting against and for the completion of the flight. Nobody can predict the outcome of a successful test flight. Thus is not a sell the news event because the “news” could have gone either way. It’s like when you bet on a baseball team to win. You don’t know if the team will win or not.

3. Those in the know on VG know that they will be conducting several more test flights over the summer. The final one with Richard Branson, the real money honeypot. Envision every test flight as a step of stairs. After this flight it will stabilize somewhere. Before the next one it will stabilize somewhere and move up before the flight as people place their bets. Just like this time. It can go either way, hell, if there is a catastrophe the stock could plummet to 0 which makes it so lucrative for the shorts.

4. Funny internet money continues to crash. People are looking for the next speculative shiny toy. SPCE is a good candidate. Elon tweeted yesterday a congratulations tweet to Virgin Galactic so cryptards will recognize the play. 

5. Remember, each flight is a bet so if you want to get in, welcome. Just know that you can lose everything on this company. If everything goes well and Branson flies this summer they will make a lot of noise which will truly moon the stock.

The essence of it seems to be sales of a three-day experience that culminates in about 6 minutes of subspace flight ans weightlessness. The pricetag for which will supposedly be about $200k. That means your customer base is limited to the top 1%, who want to do it and can also pass a required physical. 

Any bull case also has to include a basically perfect safety record, once SPCE in the operational phase. A Concord-like accident would cause the stock price to half overnight, and likely dry up the reservation books.

USTs are used as collateral in dollar funding markets several times over (known as “rehypothecation”).  These allow lending to increase the USD supply by domestic and international banks.

QE removes USTs from the market, reducing the USD supply (while simultaneously increasing M2 (sometimes referred to as “near money”) **along with** longer term interest rates.

The fiscal spending appears to be where the increased supply is coming from, and **may** actually be transitory (see Dr. Lacy Hunt’s recent [interview](https://youtu.be/kbotiZ0E2lc) with D.D.Booth).

If Dr. Hunt’s right, and it’s transitory (appears to be rolling over now in real time), the carry costs of global debt may take control and contract the money supply (ie: crypto may be selling off recently to cover leverage…?).

The contraction may be greater than the USGs ability to expand the supply (aka “papering over” losses, IOW devaluing the currency to maintain the illusion of price stability by under reporting and manipulating inflation indicators (ie: adjusting metrics and buying TIPS).

Prolonged inflation is not a given from what I can tell.. yet. But it is the only politically palatable way to default on unsustainable credit, therefore the most likely approach and an exceedingly high probability at some point.

I suspect this is the beginning of an inflationary trend. Just that the longer term mechanisms may not in place just yet, but would be expected to arrive as stressed mount.  Watching and following closely (and adjusted allocations by increasing store-of-value positions, reducing (but maintaining) bond positions, increasing cash/cash equivalents, heavy commodities, significantly reduced growth exposure, increasing certain well positioned foreign-equities with a value focus).

Also watching UST interest rates like a hawk for directional guidance, having plans for opportunity purchases in a potential growing bear market.

7433,gz5zi25,2021-05-23,t3_nipcvk,wallstreetbets,"There are so many inaccuracies in this piece I don't know where to begin. The last century of data across most of the planet suggests rapid money supply growth is more likely to PREVENT inflation than to cause it. https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/rapid-money-supply-growth-does-not-cause-inflation

The other is that this whole talk of ""human nature"" and the origins of money is incredibly bad anthropology and just macho-man fantasy.

The vast majority of money is credit and the first form of ""money"" was probably just a verbal promise. So a lot of this talk about cash is meaningless if it doesn't mention credit. Note how even today, 90% of transactions are done on credit or debit rather than cash. 

There's no reason to assume fiat or promises always fail or that a gold standard is necessary. Tribes still exist today without it and I'm sure the promise you made to your wife's boyfriend are good. Anyway, currency standards have failed just as often. 

Perhaps the only interesting thing in the article is that banks are saying they have too much cash. As the world reserve currency, global demand for US deposits has created large deflationary pressures and has helped keep inflation at bay for the last 30 years (busting unions, slashing taxes, outsourcing to asia and bombing OPEC has kept inflation away too).

If inflation starts happening now, its largely due to supply side reasons from covid and the canal blockage . Its not because of some imaginary substance like utility devaluing the dollar. Economists havent yet reconciled how money can be a store of value that you save and yet has less value the more there is. For microeconomics, money doesnt have diminishing utility like other commodities. Yet for some reason the macroeconomists assume it does.

Last thing is, why do these talks of inflation always always always revolve around the government creating more money? Banks create money too. Businesses create money when they issue commercial paper. Mutual funds create money. Heck, during the Irish Bank strikes of the 70s, people creates money by writing their own damn IOUs on napkins at the pub. No screams of inflation were heard. Whats with the double standard? And if governments can create inflation so easily why has Japan been begging for it for over 20 years?",[],0

My understanding is that silver is ""considered"" to be manipulated by the banks JPM, so a bunch of twitterbrains are trying to squeeze them.

I'm just regurgitating what I read as all my positions are still in a dying retailer, but essentially when traders buy SLV, SLV filsl their contracts from JPMs spot vault, not the market so that it doesn't affect price. eventually this goes on long enough that even though retail is buying the price doesn't go up. When retail paperhands at new lows, JPM refills their vault and rock bottom prices (because they decide/create the bottom).

Robinhood/citadel are believed to due the same thing using retail orders, the dark pools/citadels dark pool holdings, and short selling.
You ""buy"" a share on RH, they get it from citadel or just flat out write an IOU, you never touch the market so you dont affect price, price drops, you paperhand at new lows, RH closes out your trade. You never touched the market at any time.

For silver, some were saying that holding PSLV or more importantly physical silver is the way to go. PSLV has actual physical silver attributed to each share, where as SLV is more of a gneral *wink wink*  IOU.",[],1

The first was that all small denomination bills were rendered useless for obvious reasons. Then we only used the highest denomination bill (100 bs) in 2016 ish. After that Maduro’s regime issued several new bills (100,000 bs and so on) but this would only be useful for a couple weeks. Since that happened people started to rely on digital currency (cards, bank accounts, direct transfers, etc) and that held on until mid 2019. Of course that also felt out because hyperinflation is relentless so we have been going through an unofficial dollarization and rn our “main” currency is the dollar. Because of that the prices of goods are dollarized so that thing that with 100 dollars you could be king is a thing of the past. The silver and gold market has been completely hijacked by the dictatorship, destroying our portion of the Amazon and using the help of criminal groups to finance themselves so you can see that, if you don’t already have silver or gold since before all of that, it’s next to impossible to acquire those commodities to have a couple bucks in the pocket.

They say time in the market is better than timing the market because ups and downs for a good stock usually over the long haul trend up giving you a profit. If you are looking to turn 200-300 into 600 you have to gamble even more. Just be prepared to loose it all. If I were you I would put 200 in Doge and the rest of your money in any other stock you choose. You can practice day trading with the crypto without having to have 25,000.00 in your account. You can also learn how the trends and news affects your Doge investment. You may turn your 200.00 into 600.00 and you may watch it fall to 100.00 don’t sell, be patient and learn.

The last time the stock had a test flight announcement, it hit near $60, so considering this was a milestone moment for a currently very niche market company putting them in 1st position in the space tourism race, people are gonna be hungry to get in while the price is down.
