164,2021-05-19,RobinHood,"I'll break it down.  The simplified ""Drunk History"" version of what OP is talking about.  Yeah - I'm drunk.  

OP owns 100 shares of AMC.  His cost basis (not necessarily what he paid to buy them, but what they essentially cost him now after fiddling with selling options) is $10.30 a share (he essentially paid $1030 for 100 shares of AMC). 

He sold a contract saying he would sell someone his 100 shares for $13 each if on 5/28 AMC was trading at or above $13 a share.  Looks like he got paid around $79 for this contract. 

If on 5/28 AMC is above $13, he'll sell his 100 shares for $13 each (get paid $1300, he paid essentially $1030 (looks like the contract he sold got him $79), so he'll make $270 profit).  If AMC is at $50 on 5/28 (or really anything above $13), too bad for OP, he's gonna sell them for $13.

If AMC is below 13 on 5/28, he keeps the shares and makes the $79 he got for selling the contract.

OP wants to possibly buy back the contract (which now cost $225 - so he'll be down $146), but he'll have his shares to do what he wants with now that are worth $1500 with AMC at $15 (worth $200 more than at $13, but OP has to pay $146 for that now). As long as that contract is open, he doesn't really own those shares anymore. There's still 10 days until they expire, AMC could still end up below $13, or at $20 for all we know. So...OP doesn't know what to do.  

""Rolling"" is buying back his contract and selling yet another, further away in time contract to offset the cost of buying back the original one (could sell a contract to sell AMC at $15 in a month or so and break even possibly).  But, then he's still on the hook for this contract. This part is really where OP is seeking help.  To roll or not, and how far to roll (what date), as well as what strike ($13, $15, etc) to roll to.

If AMC sat still or dropped since he sold the contract, OP would have made money or have the consolation that at least he made an extra $79 (8% return on investment in a short time is good $). But...by selling the contract, he also limits his upside if AMC goes up, and has to gamble more (or at least reduce his earnings vs. a buy and hold strategy) on what will happen now.  The stock jumped up, so now he's wishing he still had control of his shares, and want's to know the best way to handle this situation.

TLDR: don't sell Covered Calls at a price you wouldn't be happy to sell your shares.  FOMO and shoulda, coulda, woulda aren't good for investment growth.",gymw2bz,t1_gylqf7y,['AMC'],0

You could

A) Add exposure - Buy another call option if you think it will go higher to mitigate some losses. 
B) Wait it out if you think AMC will take a shit before the 28th.

Either way AMC is at a critical point on its daily chart and sitting in an area of Supply. By the end of this week you'll know if it will be heading towards $20 or $9. If it breaks out of this area and starts heading north you could buy a call option. If it breaks below just sit tight. Id personally do nothing though.",gyowcqv,t3_nf9u1t,['AMC'],0

227,2021-05-19,RobinHood,"Don‚Äôt worry, I started knowing nothing until college; just check out youtube videos and also go down the rabbit hole that is TradingView if you got time.

I was a lucky guy in life but my mom who had a decent life / job (worked for the U.S. Embassy) but lived outside her means so it‚Äôs like if we were constantly in debt in my household growing up.  (Guess that‚Äôs why I got into finance huh ?)   That‚Äôs why for me personally when I started with a little over $900 I got used to making a few hundred bucks a month constantly than the home run hit that makes you $10,000 YOLO Call.  Trust me it may seem slow when you start ‚Äúeh $90 bucks a week whatever‚Äù at least it‚Äôs drinking money or a date money, but as your capital builds; later you basically can live rent/mortgage free‚Ä¶)

Basically you are buying a put (gives you the right but not the obligation to own 100 Amazon shares, so basically a derivative) and you are selling a put.  This is basically a Credit Spread.  

Check out OptionsProfitCalculator.com for the informational demo below. 

That way you can visualize you profits / losses on a contract.  

So let‚Äôs take AMZN which at some point was 3200 today.  On the website click credit spread and put in the ticker and get the price. 

Click on Buy and I would get comfortable with a 2 or 3 week out until you are comfortable.  So click on ‚ÄúSelect Option‚Äù and pick lets say May 28th.  Buy the $3100 PUT (on the right side) and then when it comes to Write (or selling) pick the $3105 for May 28th as well.  

When I did it around 11:20 AM EST (since prices and volatility constantly move our numbers might be slightly off when you read this) I was getting a $94 Credit for a collateral of $500.  That‚Äôs roughly a 18% return in two weeks, easy living don‚Äôt care about the market I just care about one stock and one number.  

IF Amazon goes below $3105 you lose it all basically, the credit and deposit BUT anytime you want you can ‚Äúclose‚Äù the contract so you can control how much you want to ride out or not.  Remember if Amazon keeps dropping today and until the 28th BUT it moves up on that Friday to $3156 or any random number above your $3105 you can keep ALL of the $94.  I personally just cash out anywhere from 60%-90% ($56.4-$84.6 in that example).  The way I see it, I rather close out and check charts when to reopen another, could be immediately or I‚Äôm waiting for a better window.

This was just a quick example not talking about the Greeks and best prices to maximize your Credit.  I hope all this does is at least make you curious about other ways to make money on the stock market.  

There is the wheel option when you are more comfortable with options and various forms of spreads in general for different situations.  As someone said to me awhile ago ‚Äúson if you can‚Äôt make money when the market is going down you got more to learn.‚Äù  

Good luck and wish you more success than I ever had.",gypi8h9,t1_gye6vlt,[],0

255,2021-05-19,RobinHood,"The problem with selling covered calls on volatile meme stocks is that you need to put a large portion of your capital into shares of volatile meme stocks.

Like what happens when one of these volatile meme stocks does a volatility and now you're either looking at 'losing' a fuck ton of money because you capped your gains at literally $100, or it takes a sudden shit and now your shares are down heavily, where you're either forced to ride it out or purchase your call back at higher IV (which will still likely be less, but considering you were getting peanuts to begin with). 

The inherent contradiction is that you're purchasing volatile stocks in the hope that they don't act volatile. You're trying to get around that by reducing the length of the contract but that just drastically decreases your premium. It's a great illustration of ""options are priced efficiently"" though, and a great recipe for getting into a losing spiral or simply getting piss poor return on your capital.

That's the problem with these ""works until it doesn't"" strats. You convince yourself you're a genius on the money train because 9/10 times you are, but that 10th time will wipe you out. Pennies and steam rollers and all that.

As an aside, I've noticed this weird disease in these new investor forums where people put way too much emphasis on things that return cash while ignoring things like opportunity cost or alpha. You're talking about dividends and weekly returns while seemingly ignoring the idea of just putting that $16k of GME into in a company that might actually be worth something in the future.",gyqp41y,t3_nfy4ly,['GME'],0

Think of it as market cap is a whole pie, and price is just the way you measure that pie if you split it into an arbitrary number of ‚Äúslices‚Äù (i.e., shares). So, if you have a market cap of $10MM and it goes up to $20MM, assuming a constant 10 shares (so $1MM per share) your price per share *must* have increased 100% (to $2MM per share). Now, some will say, what if the number of shares changes? Theoretically, then the price changes, but not the market cap. So if those $20MM are now split into 20 shares, the share price goes back to $1MM (decreases 50%), but because 2 new shares = 1 old share, market cap doesn‚Äôt change.",gyv2ctq,t3_nh6j0a,[],0

338,2021-05-20,RobinHood,"I‚Äôm not trying to be rude here, but I believe you are confused on some concepts and are mixing them up here. The basic calculation of market cap (not including treasury shares or other dilution from warrants/convertible bonds) is share price x number of shares outstanding. The ‚Äúequity claims‚Äù in a business is just another way of referring to shares in a company. Your share IS the equity claim (or risk dual claim), which means you have a partial claim to the equity in the company after all debts are retired (if any remains).

368,2021-05-21,RobinHood,Absolutely. ‚ÄúFair Value‚Äù is always subjective based on assumptions made and calculation method used. That is why stocks have a wide range of ‚Äúfair value‚Äù estimates depending on the analyst/company you are looking at.,gyxh8yr,t1_gyvtp9m,[],0
369,2021-05-21,RobinHood,"By definition: Assets = Liabilities + Equity. Basic algebra shows that: Equity = Assets - Liabilities. In fact there are MANY companies that are very successful that have NEGATIVE owner‚Äôs equity (Dominoes, McD‚Äôs, and AutoZone to name a few). Also, your formula doesn‚Äôt make sense. ‚ÄúDilution‚Äù lowers the per share value, so it must be taken into account BEFORE getting to a share price.",gyxi7d4,t1_gyvpkqy,[],0
370,2021-05-21,RobinHood,Change the graph to candle sticks.,gyx93fh,t3_nhdv69,[],1
371,2021-05-21,RobinHood,"It‚Äôs an equation. `Market cap = share price * shares outstanding` and `share price = market cap / shares outstanding`. Shares are fractions of ownership of a company, and if you are buying a fraction of something you ought to know what that something is worth in order to determine if the price is fair. Market cap tells you what the value of all the shares added up are, or in other words what it would cost to buy the entire company at that share price, so if you want to see if it‚Äôs valued correctly you compare market cap to whatever you think the company is worth. That could be book value (value of all its assets), the ratio between price and earnings (P/E), or whatever. Share price by itself without the number of shares outstanding is kind of useless when judging value.

Not that it hasn‚Äôt stopped idiots from valuing companies solely off their share price as if a company with $8 shares indicates undervaluation and higher growth potential than a company with $800 shares. Saw this all the time when AMD was $8 and people kept saying it was easier to imagine it would reach $15 than $65 NVDA reaching $100. Goes hand-in-hand with feeling like you own more stuff when you own more shares as if shares were intrinsically equal on some level and not just an arbitrary minimum slice size (fractionals notwithstanding).

That said there are benefits to lower share prices, namely liquidity due to affordability and smaller options contracts dollarwise (exchange traded options are almost always for 100 shares each regardless of what each share costs or how big a slice of the pie it represents). For that reason companies do stock splits. Apple has done several, which is why they‚Äôre around $127 while Amazon is at $3250 despite Apple being worth 30% more. On the opposite end BRK/A has famously avoided splits precisely to limit liquidity and gatekeep their shareholders and thus have a mere 1.52 million shares outstanding for a company valued at $656.78 _billion_.",gywz99u,t1_gywp4w5,['AAPL'],0

416,2021-05-21,RobinHood,"Wash sale losses are not ""disallowed"" or ""lost"" forever. It is carried forward until you exit the position entirely. Back in the day, people would sell to realize their paper losses in Dec...deduct these losses against their gains for the year...and rebuy back into the same position in Jan of the next year. The whole point of wash sale is to prevent people from claiming the same loss in one year and also the next year.

All you have to do is keep track of your total cost basis and total proceeds. Tally them at the end of the year. The only thing to be mindful of is selling any position for a loss in Dec to not rebuy the same position in Jan (wait at least 30 days). 

For your example, all 500$ is deductible on the last sale. If you rebuy XYZ on 5/30 (which is within 30 days), then that 500$ loss is carried forward to that position. You cannot deduct the 500$ loss from 5/18 unless you exit your new 5/30 position.

If you wait 30 days to rebuy XYZ (say on 6/18)...the 6/18 position counts as a new trade. Your 500$ loss from 5/18 is not carried forward and is freely deductible irregardless of what you do with your 6/18 position.",gyyzk6r,t3_nhxwlf,[],1

But my question is like...how does the government know anything about our investing/stocks? Like if I just put 100$ into Robinhood, bought some random stock, and it goes up to like 105 or something. Then cash it out and put it into my bank account. How exactly do they know anything about it? Only reason I ask is because if I hypothetically invested into like 10 stocks.....Im not sure if I would be good at keeping track with what amount was invested when and what tax rate or something.

(Please Don't flame me if this next part is below yiu knowledge level..)  If you bought the Call, and the price is above the Strike Price of the Call, Its In the Money, so it would make economic sense to execute it, or at least Sell off the option to recoup your premium and hopefully profit.

If the price is below the Call Strike Price by the execution date, it's worthless.",gzem3hk,t3_nkry9g,[],0

611,2021-05-25,RobinHood,"Main tax implications (as far as i know about US tax) to consider with investments are about the timing of when you buy/sell. If you sell an investment after less than a year of buying it, you‚Äôll have to pay higher taxes on your gains than if you held it for more than a year. Less than a year means you‚Äôll pay the tax rate of your ordinary income, maybe 20 something %. If you hold it for more than a year, your gains will be taxed at the capital gains tax rate, probably 15%. Losses will reduce your gains to zero before reducing any of your ordinary gains, but only up to 3k of losses per year, the remainder being carried forward into the future. Losses may not be allowed if you sell and rebuy an investment without enough time passing (look up wash sale rules). If you have bought multiple of the same investment but at different times, some of which were bought less than a year before you sold and some more than a year, i believe the IRS looks at it as though you sold your oldest shares first when deciding whether it was a short term or long term investment. If you gain a lot from investing, be sure you have enough cash on hand when you file your taxes so that you will have enough to pay the tax on your gains since theres no one withholding your taxes for you like employers do.

My main question is about taxes. Ive never seen a tax form in my life, but people always say when buying stocks/investing, make sure to analyze the tax you would have to pay when you cash it and such.

But my question is like...how does the government know anything about our investing/stocks? Like if I just put 100$ into Robinhood, bought some random stock, and it goes up to like 105 or something. Then cash it out and put it into my bank account. How exactly do they know anything about it? Only reason I ask is because if I hypothetically invested into like 10 stocks.....Im not sure if I would be good at keeping track with what amount was invested when and what tax rate or something.

811,2021-05-25,RobinHood,"Main tax implications (as far as i know about US tax) to consider with investments are about the timing of when you buy/sell. If you sell an investment after less than a year of buying it, you‚Äôll have to pay higher taxes on your gains than if you held it for more than a year. Less than a year means you‚Äôll pay the tax rate of your ordinary income, maybe 20 something %. If you hold it for more than a year, your gains will be taxed at the capital gains tax rate, probably 15%. Losses will reduce your gains to zero before reducing any of your ordinary gains, but only up to 3k of losses per year, the remainder being carried forward into the future. Losses may not be allowed if you sell and rebuy an investment without enough time passing (look up wash sale rules). If you have bought multiple of the same investment but at different times, some of which were bought less than a year before you sold and some more than a year, i believe the IRS looks at it as though you sold your oldest shares first when deciding whether it was a short term or long term investment. If you gain a lot from investing, be sure you have enough cash on hand when you file your taxes so that you will have enough to pay the tax on your gains since theres no one withholding your taxes for you like employers do.

I stopped reading here. You're moving the mark. You think the mark is the 'current price' because you think that's a thing rather than understanding that the bid and ask are different prices and you're looking at the mark which is the midpoint between the best bid and ask prices. When you place your order at the mark, you become the best bid and the mark becomes the midpoint between your bid and the outstanding ask.
