507,2021-05-26,StockMarket,"For me, has a lot of potential, but some improvements below. I do like the layout, dividing funds/crypto/stocks is cool too. Like the aesthetic, the speed is super responsive, and everything seems clean. 

&#x200B;

I currently use Google Docs and do the below, but it's a bit laborious/fiddly to set-up. I've also set-up on the newest Excel but ditched it because it's not real time like Google. 

&#x200B;

1) It's cool this includes other countries, such as the UK, That's a plus for me. But it displays it as dollars, and also, UK stocks are quoted in pence, so you need to divide by 100. Also, although it's nice to show as single currencies as total, the actual price should be in the currencies of the stock, it would be weird for me not seeing MSFT at $250 but £200. 

2) Be good to have £ (and probably Euro's), as these feel like major Western currencies. 

3) You need either itemised point in time comparisons or be able to enter the average buy price, so you could properly see the change in performance. 

4) Dividend payments would also be useful to see next to each stock, as well as dividend information more generally, such as ex-divi. This is also why you might need the ability to enter/upload itemised transactions, because I might have increased my holding after ex-divi. That said, even seeing my annualised expected divi at a moment in time would be useful. 

5) It could be useful to show the impact of FX. Again, if you knew the date the stock was bought and the currencies, you could look up the FX on that day, and calculate versus today. Alternatively, you could ask the user to upload that value when entering a transaction. 

6) If this is meant to be a wealth dashboard, there's a few areas missing. Properties, retirement accounts, savings, other bank accounts, etc, could likewise do with their own sections, even if you had to manually add them in, be good to have options. 

7) When you click on day/week/month/all, it would be good if your columns toggled to match, so if you clicked week, as well as the graph updating, so would the $24hr and 24hr% 

8) More dashboard on top. For example, sector splits, dividend by month received/projected, performance by country and/or performance by index, wealth stacked graphs showing breakdown by investment type, +/- by day, perhaps a variance distribution aggregating %s, so 0.00-0.24%, 8 occurrences, 0.25%-0.49%, 7 occurrences, and so on, performance versus selectable benchmarks, etc.",gzgt4b2,t3_nkzr8v,[],1

535,2021-05-26,StockMarket,"Sounds like you have good ideas and plans. Keep researching and keep focusing on the companies. Try to ignore the market volatility if you can. This assumes you are a long term buy and hold investor. If you are looking at trading, or timing the market you will need a very different mindset and skills.

So if was starting a new portfolio I would go with something like this:

    10%      Cash
10% VTI  Vanguard Total Market Index ETF
10% VXUS Vanguard Total International ETF
10% VB   Vanguard Small Cap ETF
10% VTV  Vanguard Value ETF
10% VNQ  Vanguard Real Estate ETF
10% VIG  Vanguard Dividend ETF
30%      15 Stocks (2% each)

The ETFs give a solid lower volatility base and the stock picks provide higher growth with higher risk. The cash position will give you flexibility to take advantage of market changes or new stock picks that opportunistically present themselves.

As for your suggestions, you can't really go wrong with AAPL, but keep in mind that it is almost a value stock now and is unlikely to see high growth. NET is a better growth choice and is a solid company with good future prospects as you noted.

If you are looking for a complete portfolio, including some starting stock picks you could try this for ideas:

These decisions take varying time, e.g.; fear (and it’s variants) may process quite rapidly while doubt, a far removed family member of fear may linger.  Human fear and exuberance (and all their children, FOMO, free fall fear - the variants as it were) cognitively process in the human time  it takes the average person to get over said emotions.  

That’s calculable in temporal terms because you can see it in the chart and time and volume analysis.  Larger samples, more accurate picture thus increased reliability.  

Emotionless system traders and their digital counterparts algos, bots, etc. would modify these results smoothing but not eliminating emotional indicators.  Brownian motion is quantifiable by historical comparison and you have a three way interpretation with emotions (the range and type of them expressed) over time, algo quantification as a reduction factor to emotion and Brownian motion measured by extent of Brownian standardization. A tree limb growth range over large temporal sample across the top type of growing variety for hypothetical example.

Triangulate this against the backdrop of a bell curve accounting for trading periods likelihood dullest day ever to black swan and populated categorically by weight of occurrence and you might have a broad view 

Since willpower, experience, emotionless trading and purely technical traders are modifiers to market emotions itself, they would have to be attributed and quanta respected as well.

In layman’s terms, the implication is that banks are overexposed. They need the treasuries to reduce their exposure.

The fact that more and more banks (participants) seems to be rushing for more and more collateral (treasuries), is a sign that the music that started with QE is about to stop. The banks that won’t have enough collateral to cover their exposure will go bust.

Most cash in a bank’s balance sheet is money they created when they loaned it. Which means it’s IOUs, and they are exposed to the risk of the party they loaned it to defaulting.

This is what is meant by ""exposure"".

Treasuries are collateral (assets) they can use to cover for the risk. It doesn’t have to be 1:1, but there is a ratio at which it balances the risk. If that ratio is not met, they are overexposed, i.e. they don’t have the assets to balance the risk.

The problems arise when banks package loans into securities, sell them away, which spreads them into the market (they are on other banks’ balance sheets), make profits on those because there is a housing market bubble (for example), and that bubble bursts. This is 2008.

As for what the future holds, I can’t explain it, because I haven’t seen it happen. But the pandemic will generate a lot of defaults. What is the investment vehicle that bears this toxicity? I don’t know. But my money is on the Fed itself being overexposed, which would lead to a monetary crisis, since the toxic asset (which were the MBS in 2008) will be the USD. Since it is the reserve currency, the choice for other economic players (countries) will be to leave the US to rot, or go down with them.

There is no existing leading figure in Bitcoin who could manipulate the market. (Looking at ADA for example) It is decentralized. Even if someone wanted to take control by having 51% of the hashing power, he couldn't do useful things except damage the value of Bitcoin. Nobody can create new coins out of nothing or reverse transactions. So who would spend tens of billions just to not create value? It's better to just follow the rules to generate revenue. That's the reasons Bitcoin became the proven store of value everybody is talking about. So far no other crypto has proven to be able to do that. Besides that... Bitcoin is easily accessible on every exchange etc and has the most hashing power and is the most well known so far with a lot of backing from a large use base, a very large ecosystem of start ups, open source projects and entrepreneurs.",gzivdyx,t3_nlj3wc,[],0

It’s completely under the radar. 300M cap, there aren’t any options for it that I know of and have low institutional ownership. 

It’s an online insurance broker in China, which has a Gross written premium growing at about 14-16% per year compared to 2-4% growth for other countries. China still has 600M people not yet on the internet (future customers). I like to invest in industries with growing upside (China insurance industry) and like to invest in Co’s that operate in the expenses of that industry (I did this with IIPR for the pot industry, which operates grow houses for all the Pot companies).
