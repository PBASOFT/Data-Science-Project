And yes taxes hurt economies, but the impact of taxes can be offset somewhat by spending the tax revenue.   The best plan by far is just offering everyone a pro-rata credit based on all carbon taxes collected.  E.G. if a carbon tax in the US generates $300 billion in revenue each quarter, each citizen will get a quarterly check for $1,000 (assuming 300m people).   Net cost to taxpayers is zero, but those who fly more and eat more meat and own humvees will lose relative to those who don't travel and take the bus.

Yes, it would still be a net detriment to the economy in the short term (as we would be pushing people away from the most efficient and cheapest fuel sources), but presumably we should be willing to take that hit in order to do more to fight climate change.",[],0

**START HERE:** [‚ÄúIf You Can‚Äù by William Bernstein.](https://www.etf.com/docs/IfYouCan.pdf)

If you want an expanded version of that, Bernstein‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThe Four Pillars of Investing‚Äù is amazing.

I am not a fan of buying individual stocks and prefer buying all of them via index funds. Here‚Äôs another Bernstein article on that:

[The 15-Stock Diversification Myth ](http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/900/15st.htm)

> ‚Ä¶ **a grossly disproportionate fraction of the total return came from a very few ""superstocks""** like Dell Computer, which increased in value over 550 times. If you didn‚Äôt have one of the half-dozen or so of these in your portfolio, then you badly lagged the market. (The **odds of owing one of the 10 superstocks are approximately one in six.**) Of course, by owning only 15 stocks you also increase your chances of becoming fabulously rich. But unfortunately, in investing, it is all too often true that **the same things that maximize your chances of getting rich also maximize your chances of getting poor.**

> ‚Ä¶even 100 stocks are not nearly enough to eliminate this very important source of financial risk.

> So, yes, Virginia, you can eliminate nonsytematic portfolio risk, as defined by Modern Portfolio Theory, with a relatively few stocks. It‚Äôs just that nonsystematic risk is only a small part of the puzzle. Fifteen stocks is not enough. Thirty is not enough. Even 200 is not enough. **The only way to truly minimize the risks of stock ownership is by owning the whole market.**

Added bold for emphasis. This is an argument in favour of index fund investing over stock-picking.

Now, it‚Äôs possible for will continue to do well, and *may* turn into one of those ‚Äúsuper stocks‚Äù Bernstein mentions. That‚Äôs a gamble though. IMO, most people would be better off with an index fund for most of their investments, maybe save a few percent for single stock gambles.

The next step is do research on areas you're interested in. If you're curious about gene editing or robotics, it makes researching the companies working on it that much easier. When you get caught up, companies will pop up with what they're doing in the space and you'll be better informed about whether a company is positioned to capitalize on that market.

Your terminology on both revenue and expenditures are likely incorrect, at least when speaking in context of publically traded entities which use the accrual basis of accountanting and not cash basis. When a company ""brings in"" money is not important. What is important is when revenue is recognized and when expenses are inccurred, these are not necessesarily duirng the same peroid of time when cash is collected or spent. 

If I sell you a good in Q4FY21 but you don't pay me until Q1FY22, the revenue is still recogized in Q4FY21. Same with expenses under the accural basis. 



>For most firms, revenue recognition is a simple process, where once a product or service is sold, it is recorded as revenues.

Business wishes this was true but it's absolutly not lol. Even in the transacting of a seemingly simple single good of services there are countless contengicies and contract terms that can impact the recogniction of revenue.

It's called the geometric mean - essentially its a way to calculate the central tendency and estimate selling distribution. Based on this (this guys here did a calculation https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m9td6w/estimations_for_the_total_payout_of_gme_based_on/), even if it gets to $20M/share (I'm still highly skeptical, buy hey who knows), the highest likely price would be $4T. 

This part I am entirely unsure of, because I don't think this type of event has ever occurred. But from what's been pieced together, this is what I think the chain of events are: When the short seller's debt exceeds their margin, the broker liquidates collateral to settle the debt. When the debt is so high the brokers can't solve the debt, the clearing entities liquidate the brokers. This chain continues all the way up to the DTCC and eventually the Feds. As far as I understand it (and I could be wrong, I'm not an expert on this), the DTCC originally never believed any of its members would run into such a financial shit show. They literally didn't have any mechanisms in place to protect the market from a financial black hole. This is one of the reasons (believed) for the flurry of rules being passed lately. The DTCC's job is to make sure people get their money and the market doesn't shatter, after all.

At the end of the day, the money will have to come from somewhere. Even if that results in money printing from the Fed (hence Dr Burry's prediction of hyperinflation). If GME share holders don't get paid, then it becomes an international fraud issue. And I don't think the US government wants international fraud across hundreds of countries.

Well, no, not really.

First you have to pay borrowing costs in addition to the interest you pay on your margin account. And the borrowing costs depend on how difficult it is to borrow that stock. So for something undergoing a short squeeze the borrowing costs snowball higher and higher.

Second, as the price of the stock increases, so do your short ""losses"" or amount of money you owe. If this gets too high then you'll get margin called.

So you can't just remain short forever waiting for the price to drop.

Second, yes they are stable. Let's be real, nobody is building any more railroads. Railroads are land owners for the right-of-way the tracks are laid on, asset holding companies for the rails, locomotives and rolling stock, and major freight/intermodal players. Backtested against the SP500, they blow it out of the water over the last 20 years with practically zero risk giving how essential they are to the country.

I'll give ya a quick rundown on the remaining 5 Class I railroads:

BNSF - privately owned by Berkshire Hathaway. I own some BRK.B because of this. Really, really wish they were public. Best of the bunch for US rail, imo.

UNP - largest public US railroad. Covers Western US. They haul everything across the country. Rate of stock gain is 2nd to last, but I can't imagine owning railroads without UNP in there. 

CSX and NSC - East coast/Midwest freight hauling coal/intermodal/commodities. Growing exponentially in terms of value. Good buy

CNI - just merged with KSU (Kansas City Southern) to create the only Canada-US-Mexico point-to-point railroad. Great entry point right now too as they paid so much for KSU that their stock took a 13% drop due to the debt taken on. Until now, rate of stock gain has been slowest of the 5 railroads, but should this merger go through long-term they may be the best hold.

CP - far and away my favorite holding. Their rate of growth is incredible, their financials strong, their leadership the best in the business. They along with CNI are the only Class I railroads in Canada. Their stock regularly takes 8% dips then roars back, so I'd wait for a better entry point or DCA in with a small initial.

Of course, do your own DD, but that's my take from a guy whose been holding these a long time. About 30-40 years ago there were 100s of railroads. Soo Line, Wisconsin Central, etc etc etc. They've all been bought out by these 5, making them stronger and resistant to competition than ever, and thus laws were passed against any more mergers due to monopoly concerns. The CNI-KSU merger is likely the last we will ever see, and it's still no sure thing as the STB (Surface Transportation Board) has not approved it yet as it would make CNI too strong. I consider each of these railroads as akin to Google essentially owning the internet. Nobody is coming for them. 

Lastly, they all recently underwent PSR (Precision Scheduled Railroading) which is a new way of moving freight, instead of going when a unit train is full, they run at set times, regardless of manifest cargo, in order to keep cars moving and customers from waiting. This has enormously cleaned up operations costs and efficiency for all involved, and railroads are now operating in the 21st century with better revenues than ever.

A good stock for investing in is also a good stock for daytrading most of the time. What we look for as day traders is a company with good fundamentals, and at least two solid quarters of earnings/growth. Then we look at how much volatility the stock has. Volatility within a range is excellent for us. Say you have 25k in your account and you found a stock thats been performing above and beyond expectations for at least two quarters. You then need to identify the normal range of that stock. Keep an eye on it in a watch list. Learn its daily patterns. One day when you notice that it's fallen below it's normal trading range, and there's no news to support that drop...we usually look for a 5% drop on growth stocks...that's when you buy shares. Depending on the price of the underlying stock, we try to trade anywhere from 100 shares to 10k shares on a single stock, in multiple lots. Your goals, and thus earnings will be different from others with different size accounts and risk tolerances. I started out with a goal of $50 per trade and was happy with that. Then as I learned the ropes I slowly increased my position sizes and thus my earning potential on individual plays. I usually trade between 500 and 2000 shares per position, and I look for $200+ as my exit. I set limits and take profits so I can move on the the next play or re-enter the same ticker again and again and again. I've played a single ticker probably 10 times in a single day.

I don't short. That's not for me. I only play to the upside, and only on solid stocks, because if the position goes against me after I buy in, I know that I will be able to get back out in time. Usually within a few days.

I hope this helps you get some idea about what you could potentially make, and how you might go about picking a good potential stock for trading. Paper trading is only good for practicing entries and exits on your platform of choice. It does nothing for you actually executing when there's real money on the line though. That's why you only trade what you're comfortable losing on any given position.

Think of if this way.  When the person/kid running the lemonade stand decided to sell the magic rocks for money.  A couple of things happened.

First, the person/kid is no longer completely in charge of how the lemonade stand is run.  The person/kid now needs a board of directors to direct him/her how to run the lemonade stand.

As a holder of the magic rocks, you then get to attend a meeting, and vote on certain things that's happening within the company.  If enough magic rock holders decide, they can kick out people for the board and install people they like.  The board -- if the former owner of the lemonade stand didn't keep enough magic rocks can be removed from the business.

As the lemonade stand is now required to submit financials for the owners of the magic rocks to look over, the lemonade stand is now in a way answerable to the people who hold the magic rocks.",[],0

940,gzlqry8,2021-05-27,t3_nlwxkg,stocks,"Think of it this way. Stock is ownership. 

You have a lemonade stand. It‚Äôs a successful one, as far as neighborhood lemonade stands go. You own 100%, which means that you own 100% of the equity. In the beginning, let‚Äôs say you could sell your family lemonade recipe for $100, you own some equipment worth a few grand, and you pull in a couple thousand every quarter. You want to expand, but that requires funding. You need a million dollars to buy the equipment, pay employees, purchase real estate for your stores, etc. But what do you have to offer someone who can give you that funding? 

You can offer investors $1 for every lemonade sold. That‚Äôs a royalty deal. Or you can offer them a percentage of your company. Let‚Äôs say you convince two investors your lemonade business will be a huge success. They agree to pony up $500,000 each for 25% of your company. In real life, they‚Äôd probably want riders attached to that money to reduce their risk, and board seats, but let‚Äôs keep it simple. Right now, by investing that money, they‚Äôre saying your company is worth $2,000,000 if you sold the company‚Äîyes the entire company‚Äîto a willing buyer (actually, they‚Äôre hoping someone will pay a lot more). That‚Äôs right‚Äîwhen someone wants to buy your lemonade company, you‚Äôre not handing them bags of lemons when they write you a check. What you hand them is your company stock. (Better be some good lemonade!)

Now you all could be wrong. The lemonade company can fail and be worth zero. No one would want to buy it. 

On the flip side though, If your lemonade is a big success, people will want to buy your company for considerably more than $2,000,000. Heck, you might earn $2,000,000 just in lemonade sales a year, in addition to the value of your equipment and real estate. Now, you could take an offer from the private equity firm that wants to give you $5,000,000 to walk away, but your original investors think people will pay a whole lot more. That‚Äôs when these investors say, hey man, you should IPO, raise more money for growth (and for our profitable exit). 

Lemonade is hot right now. So everyone wants in. The IPO values you at $20,000,000, based on your book value, your earnings, and what some folks think you can pull in over the next few years. If someone wants to come along and buy your company outright (all its stock), that‚Äôs what they‚Äôll need to pay. Suddenly, the stock held by your original investors (assuming no dilution, keeping it simple) is worth $5,000,000. They can sell off some equity and make a nice profit. 

Those who buy in at the IPO price are making the same calculation those original investors did. That your company will grow and become more valuable to those who want to buy or control it. For a retail investor buying a small amount of stock, they‚Äôll never get a board seat, they‚Äôll never have a prayer of owning a significant part of the company and exerting control... but the whales, the institutional investors and large investment banks absolutely will. They‚Äôll be paying more per share for the privilege of controlling the company via board seats or activism, and may even bid to takeover the company outright. In the belief that they can drive even more growth and value, and make your lemonade company even more valuable to future buyers. 

When you finally sell to PepsiCo for $40,000,000, the stock those IPO holders bought is worth double. The stock those original investors held? Well, let‚Äôs just say they cash out feeling very happy for themselves. 

Upon the sale of the company, there can be a few different outcomes for investors, but a cash for stock deal is one that might make the most sense to you. In that scenario, you get paid based on that $40,000,000 valuation. If you bought in much lower, you made a nice profit. 

Good example is LEAF. Worth $1 a share a year ago when the company was valued at around $37,000,000. Now the company sold to another company for $323 million. Shareholders will get $8.50 a share in cold hard cash. The company that bought LEAF isn‚Äôt paying $8.50 for air, they‚Äôre buying a company. Stock is the way the ownership transfers. 

To you, a Redditor who likely does not have a ton of equity in any company, of course stock seems inherently worthless. You will never own the company. You will never control it. You will never sell it or merge it or spin-off it‚Äôs parts or do anything to change the company‚Äôs value at all. But people far more wealthy and powerful than you will. And their intention is to always drive the fundamentals of a company to become more valuable so that part or all of it can be sold for more money. The democratic thing about stock investing is that whatever price they sell to each other for, that‚Äôs the price you can sell your stock for too.

Of course there are pumps and dumps, situations where stock values are inflated, wildly divorced from fundamentals and there‚Äôs no way the company will ever sell (or raise funds) at that price. In these cases, it‚Äôs really just gambling. But valuations tend to revert to a mean over time and represent true value. If you own stocks that are insanely overvalued (you know the ones), ideally you get out before the music stops.

In short, stock has value because it really does represent ownership. The profits a company makes that aren‚Äôt paid out in dividends are retained or reinvested in the company, and if handled responsibly, the company becomes more attractive to those who would want to buy it outright or own enough to exert influence. Ownership is power. Not for you, gentle Redditor, but for those at the top that trade the stock, it absolutely is. You just get to benefit by the money they‚Äôre willing to pay.",[],0

955,gzls1sa,2021-05-27,t1_gzl9vat,stocks,"How much would you pay to buy a company that earns a million in profit a year? Let‚Äôs say the owner agreed to sell it for $10 million. You buy the business and make some improvements. Now the company is making $2 million a year. Would you then sell the company to someone else for $10 million? Of course not. You doubled the profits, at the very least you‚Äôd want $20 million for it. 

Now let‚Äôs say instead of selling to one owner, you sell to many owners. Or instead of selling all of the company, you just sell a quarter of it. That ownership is represented by stock shares. The same concept applies. Let‚Äôs say they you sold a million shares at $20 a piece to get your $20,000,000 valuation. The majority owner would run the company, but the others would also be owners, albeit, of varying degrees of relevance. If the company profits double again, would these owners sell their shares for $20? Of course not. The company would be worth at least $40 million. So if they all sell or some sell, they‚Äôd sell their shares for at least $40. 

A company is physical. Money is worth something. So as long as a company is growing physically and making more money, it‚Äôs more valuable. And it‚Äôs owners can sell their stake at any time. 

You owning 2 shares, you have no influence on the company. But your shares are not worth less than the shares owned by someone who owns 25% of the company. In fact, if you sell, it might just be that 25% owner who buys your shares as part of a larger buy to up his stake to 30%. For him, he does have influence. Probably a board seat or two or three. And that person has the power to do things that can make the company, and his investment, more valuable. Again‚Äîthose shares represent the assets of the company. 

I know this is a simplification, and shares may be valued more highly or less highly regardless of the actual fundamentals, but stock does have an intrinsic value, and that value is the value of the company‚Äôs assets and potential growth. As those assets and growth accumulate, so should the stock price and the value of that ownership, even if you only own 2 shares.",[],0

A successful business will grow it‚Äôs value over time, even by simply using the same assets over and over to create more goods or services. 
That is in general terms called intrinsic value. If you own stock in this company, you own a piece of that business. If you want to convert the value of that share into money ( I.e a currency system to store and transfer value that you can use in exchange for goods and services) you have to sell it to someone in exchange for said money. To do that, you have to agree with the buyer on a price, that is then paid. Markets are very effective in assessing the price of something( but not perfect). That‚Äôs why we use those for it. The general theory is, that the market will, over time, price any asset according to it‚Äòs current value. (It does not actually do that in many cases, for a variety of reasons, but that‚Äôs a different story) So in a way, a share is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it at any given time, this should, but doesn‚Äôt have to reflect the intrinsic value of the company it represents.",[],0
