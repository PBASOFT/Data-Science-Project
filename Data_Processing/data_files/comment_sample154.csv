193,gz78mjj,2021-05-23,t3_nint1f,pennystocks,"Im up 20% and i can tell you guys what you are doing wrong.

1. short term charts and technicals are pure voodoo.  read: scam alert.  Technicals were invented to look at where the bulk of volume occurs in a daily relative to that days high and low to identify the LONG TERM direction of the bid/asks.  Looking at 5d chart or even a 1month chart is astrology.  NM a 5 minute chart.  Someone starts talking that nonsense and you should immediately mute them.
2. Market cap over 100m, float over 1b = avoid.  And these are the tiniest price per shares.  But its misleading and scammy.  Just like safemoon.  ""if even a few of these zeroes drop off""....that would put the market cap at trillions bro.  They do it on purpose.  They dump out all these shares in the public at a tiny price per and ppl think ""wow, its .0007, imagine if it  went to even $1.  Meanwhlie, the company has no revenue and is valued at 80m.  

3. Dont chase so much.  Dont look for the next thing that is going to boom (ignore all short term technicals).  Look for something that has 0 chatter.  ""but it when its quiet.""  Patience is required.  Find undervalued, tight share structures and ease in over time.  The less hype while you are accumulating, the better.  Dont go for the top mentions.  Dont go for ""the chart says its about to fly"".  

4. I dont know who told y'all reverse splits were a bad thing, but thanks everyone for the cheap High Tide shares.  Me and my money manager friends are scooping them with gusto.  Because reverse splits are GOOD.  Tight share structures are GOOD.  Yes something at 0.5 appears to have more rocket potential than something at 7.5, but its appearance only.  Its the market cap, not the share price.  

5. For goodness sakes, mix in some adult stocks will you?  20% OTCs and pennies is probs where you want to be (max).    

6. Watch your tax implications and try not to trigger wash sales   

7. Sentiment can change, outlook can change.  Market cycles change.  Not every dip is buy worthy.  

8. There is value in a 3% (or better) dividend  

9. Im at the bottom and I regret that this is coming off snarky.  But I dont want to go up and edit.  So apologies for any snark.  Im trying to be direct, but not rub anything in.  But my concern is that some of you are down and are going to get huge tax bills because you wont be able to take any losses due to wash sales rules.  Also, i fear that actually, we are do for a market correction.  Thats what the money managers are saying.  And if you think the pennies/otcs are going to hold up better than the large caps during a correction, you are wrong.  People will run to large cap value/dividend and they will hold up better (but still not well).  In a bear market otc / pennies / speculative get CRUSHED, and we're due for a bear cycle.  Just because you are down , doesnt mean the SPY is.  Sorry, not trying to be aggressive.  I post a lot here.  I wish you all success.  But money managers are not your enemy.  Its the people you are listening to telling you the chart says primed for a break out.",[],0

VBHI is a decent example. I own some of this penny bc they are now debt free, and they have been acquiring revenue producing assets.

If you're going to make a lot of trades, or only buy small amounts, you'll probably want Fidelity or Schwab, because there's no fee to buy or sell.

If you're going to buy large quantities, or not do a lot of trading, you might be happy with TD Ameritrade or E-Trade. Their apps are a little easier to use, but they charge $6.95 per transaction when buying OTC stocks. (No charge for ""regular"" stocks.)

If you're going to buy a lot of Canadian, or other foreign stock (assuming you're in the US), you'll want E-Trade, because there's no extra Foreign Stock fee to buy or sell. (Schwab and Fidelity charge $50, and TD Ameritrade charges $15. You'll pay that both when you buy and when you sell.)

It's okay to have accounts with more than one of them. None of them charge you money to open an account. Some of them have promotions, like if you put a certain amount of money in your account to start, they'll add a little more. Google to see what promotions might work for you, but don't choose a broker because of that.

Don't use Robinhood. Google, and you'll find many reasons why.

Full Disclosure: I have E-Trade by default. My original account was with Sharebuilder, which became Capital One Investing, and then E-Trade. I'm very happy with them, and love the app. (If you have $200 or more in your account, you get access to a great real-time live ticker.) I also have Schwab.

My point is not necessarily even about CTXR.  Just that to me, a P&D is a scam.  Artificially juice the value, intentionally, with the plan of dumping on people buying in late.  


All Im really trying to say is that there is a lot of middle ground between something being a pump & dump and something being great long term.  


Regarding CTXR, my personal opinion is that the mkt cap is a little high for my tastes for an early stage bio company.  But I think its a good company.  If I was to rate it strong buy (A+) or buy (B+) or strong hold (B-) or cautious hold (c-), or sell (D), or strong sell (F-)  


I would prob but CTXR on the line between buy and strong hold (solid B).  Before its recent run, when the market cap was lower, I would have rated it a B+.  So I think its a solid play, even after the run.  


But again, my comment was not necessarily about CTXR, just that not everything that isnt ""great long term"" isnt necessarily a P&C scam.  I would say that only a few tickers are ""great long term"" cuz thats a high bar, and I would also say that only a few tickers are ""P&D scams.""  Most tickers are somewhere in between.",[],1

First the bad - I see three institutional investors closing their positions recently.  But I see plenty more institutional investors buying in recently.  And also look at the names who are buying in.  Schwab, Morgan Stanley, Jane (these are big powerful institutions and you want them on your side).  Also look at the big position Sabby took out.  Now a lot of people do not like Sabby because they manipulate.  But I assure you, Sabby didnt buy in to lose money.  I think the good here, significantly outweighs the bad.  Link below.

Agree with everyone that you should do your own research but yeah sometimes it doesn‚Äôt make sense at first glance.  A premarket jump can quickly drop if bag holders are looking for an exit (SPCE today), not to mention meme stocks taking over fundamentals.  Penny stocks often depart from fundamentals and are more event-driven like you mentioned, like DGLY and BLM protests.  Sometimes in penny stocks it‚Äôs all about it being new and not yet jumped.  Also, boomer books teach ‚Äúrule of 72‚Äù for a target of 6% per year to double in 12 years, but if I‚Äôm up 100% after a few days then ain‚Äôt no way I‚Äôm holding for the long term (and buying after the price jump can lead to holding a loss for years as profits are taken by early investors).

As a rule, if it‚Äôs got traction on Twitter then it‚Äôs too late.  Not always true but in general keeps me safe from P&D.

Definitely check the Redditor‚Äôs account age.  I usually never trust new accounts as this group became visible to scammers in 2020 (at least on a large scale).  Again not always true, but it‚Äôs good to know post history is solid.  I have 2 Redditors I follow and believe in but neither is a crystal ball so don‚Äôt get mad if they‚Äôre wrong (again, nobody really knows).

If it‚Äôs a biopharma play I check the calendar https://www.biopharmcatalyst.com/calendars/pdufa-calendar.  Nothing like a known catalyst date to get in early on, just beware the offerings that can happen during your 1-2 month hold.  Check company‚Äôs cash on hand before investing too much, or take a small position that you add to if it dips.  Working good for me on ITRM (bought $1.16, doubled own at $0.96, and in the green with a July catalyst I‚Äôll sell sometime in June).

If it‚Äôs an industry catalyst I Google it (Colonial Pipeline shut down made money on CPE/KMI etc.).  Also weekend news helps (Virgin Galactic news broke Saturday so we knew it was going up and I had a $22.00 limit buy that didn‚Äôt fill but sometimes these do and they usually print gains).

Also SEC forms help tbd the strategy like insider buying or predicting an offering based on cash trajectory.  https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html.

969,gzapdge,2021-05-24,t3_njpq9i,pennystocks,I know others have pointed this out but no company opens on the market as a 0.0001 stock. All initial listings would open at a perceived value based on what they feel is a fair market price whether that is 50 cents or 200 bucks. Only though issuing of additional shares do they get diluted to the point where they end up trading as sub penny stocks. Most companies that have any value reverse split to keep that dilution down but companies that are essentially defunct shells can just keep issuing stock to make their scammy ceo's pay cheques at the expense of everyone else. You need to treat anything trading below a penny as a you would betting zero on a roulette wheel. Assume you are going to lose what you put in.
