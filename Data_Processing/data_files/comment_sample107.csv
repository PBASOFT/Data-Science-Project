70,gyslk7c,2021-05-20,t1_gysdaur,StockMarket,"I don‚Äôt know if it was the masks, or the distancing, or the constant sanitization, but as someone who spent the entire pandemic working closely with thousands of people every day, I can say indisputably something worked!  

Before the pandemic, I usually spend all my winter mornings dislodging nastiness from my nose, amazed at the color and consistency of my mucous.  About 4 weeks of which I‚Äôm also solid coughing, like I‚Äôve been smoking since I was 5.  I contract the flu at least annually.  

Throughout the pandemic, I literally haven‚Äôt coughed once.  Some Phlegmmy coughs after eating, but that‚Äôs it.  I even suffer terrible allergies, but can count on my fingers and toes how many times I‚Äôve sneezed.

I was the first one to ask what the size of a covid particle is, in relation to a fart particle, and guess what, I can smell farts through this mask...  but my personal experience literally proves to me that masks work.  I don‚Äôt think they are impregnable, but they likely reduce greatly the amount of covid you could breathe in, which I think matters.  Of course I believe strongly that any one counter measure by itself, is not nearly as strong as all of them together - (I mask, you mask, 6ft, and if sick stay home).

So you can dismiss me as a robot, which I‚Äôd like to be by the time my body fails, or you can add it to your list of possibilities that at least I believe what I‚Äôm saying.

The question isn‚Äôt whether or not it works, it‚Äôs whether or not we want to go down that road of using medieval tactics to start fighting communicable disease.  I think it was a noble effort to do what we can to save the people most vulnerable to covid.  I think there‚Äôs elements to covid (the fact that it can get to your brain, how long it takes to recover in some people, etc) that make it more dangerous than the common cold.  Also, that‚Äôs just what it is now.  If left to run rampant, maybe it could be more virulent, more communicable, more lethal in the future...  But you have to look at what it‚Äôs done to the world economies too.  Strap in.  We are at the beginning of one hell of a ride!

I think it‚Äôs important to figure out how this thing started.  If it was a bat in a forest... ok, let‚Äôs figure out how to get in front of the next one, rather than just wait for it to happen.  If it was an accident in a lab, well I suppose that could‚Äôve just as easily been us.  Have an ounce of accountability, admit it, pay your dues, and move on.  If it was an attack on the world, for reasons, then holy moly you just started ww3.  But I don‚Äôt think we should accept, that it just magically happened...

However it is a good catalyst for development of a process to rapidly develop a vaccine in real time, to counter this and other viruses.  What if we had the vaccine in early 2020?  Then masks really wouldn‚Äôt be necessary.  And it‚Äôs about time we got rid of the common cold.  I‚Äôm not sure I really need that bitch any more!

However covid came about, it sure was a wake up call that at any moment all our successes and  accomplishments can be toppled fairly easily and quickly, by something as simple as a bat virus.  We need to get in front of it.  I also, of course, hold as a possibility that maybe getting in front of it was exactly what we (humans in a lab in China) were trying to do, and it blew up in our faces!

Areas of interest to me that I‚Äôm too lazy to research, or are obfuscated by the powers that be:

-How many people died of flu 2019, 2020, 2021

-overall death rates in 2019, 2020, 2021

But they do this so that they can monitor more properly the movement of the items you are looking at. And then they only execute the sale when prices are moving downward so that they can milk the spread to the biggest amount possible.  It is why when you go to place a limit buy and it doesn't go through and you go to look again and suddenly the price is a few pennies higher, they're not showing you the correct number when you go to place your bid or to place your limit buy and then you find that it fails and you go ""I'd better bid higher"".... they do that on purpose. It's a gambling lure. And they have the thing in their terms of service and say ""Hey the charts aren't accurate"". It's a bit of a scam, it's one of the things that Robinhood does that really is kind of wrong. Its legal. But it's the commission that every 1 of us are paying, It's almost as much as on E trade. And when you take that into consideration, Robinhood starts to become not really a stock buying place, but more of a gambling pit.

If you gotten it Tesla before $100 you likely would have sold at $200 or something and missed the massive run up.   I mean be honest.  If you bought in the middle of 2018 when would you have sold?   Would you have sold when it bled out from there by nearly 40% by 2019?   Would you have just sold and taken the loss or averaged down?   And from there when the stock traded back up to erase most of your losses but it wasn't until early 2020 when the stock really rose again.    That was basically 1.5 years of stock price floating in a fairly tight range before it started to really climb.   But then there was pull back after pull back on the up.  Feb 21 2020 it hit a high of $180 a share and then the pandemic arrive and by March 20th the stock price was sitting at $85 or so.    And then everyone knows what happened there.   I mean why you didn't realize at the bottom of the panic you could have bought the stock for $85 and sold a year later for a 1000% gain?    I mean it is pretty obvious looking back but at the time?   

You said you are not a fan of timing the market and then say you should do it.   In this case I disagree.   It is easy to look back and think you know what you would do.   But after the coronacrash would you really have been dumping massive amounts of money into Tesla right at the end of the March 2020?   I mean that wasn't that long ago and everyone had the opportunity to buy then below $100 a share.   So why didn't you?  See the problem is it is easy to say you would do X when you didn't do it.   And since you didn't have the conviction to do it then any advice now is meaningless.     To be able to hold to large gains isn't luck.    It is having the conviction to hold long and believe even through the ups and downs that there is more upside.     Selling half now is stupid unless you believe the stock price is going to keep falling significantly.  And no one knows what it will do.   This could be the bottom.   If you were going to sell half that should have been done early this year when Tesla hit the ATH.

Cybertruck is cool, but it's looks are a bit out there for the conservative buyer. Gramps just wants to buy what he knows is going to work - that's an F150.

591,gytnjox,2021-05-20,t3_ngoknc,StockMarket,"How innovative have each of these companies been over the past few years? Intel, comfortable with its dominating market share, was stagnant essentially making minor upgrades to their product lines each cycle. AMD took advantage of this by heavily investing in new chip architecture, creating a better product, and taking share away from Intel. NVDA was similar to Intel in that it‚Äôs 20 series GPUs was a minor upgrade from the 10 series. NVDA saw what AMD did to Intel, knew AMD was designing a new GPU, so they responded with huge upgrades in the 30 series. 

Intel has provided their innovation roadmap showing it‚Äôll be back to making competitive products in 2022. AMD will continue to innovate with its chip architecture; it hasn‚Äôt competed with NVDA in terms of GPU value performance, but it has come pretty close. AMD‚Äôs next GPU line could go toe-to-toe with NVDA‚Äôs next line.

tl;dr, AMD has been a catalyst for innovation by becoming a real competitor against NVDA and Intel. All 3 companies will continue to innovate and make substantial upgrades to their product lines; each doesn‚Äôt want to be left behind, especially Intel.",[],0

Should we really care if someone does not do research and bets based on his feelings, when it is his own money?
Assuming we refer to retail, public sentiment plays a big role. Even when it comes to hedge funds a lot of advisors use their gut and walk street chatter over numbers.

With Tesla their numbers do not justify their growth, and the public sentiment mostly resolves around his persona. I could argue that financially space X makes more sense, as a long position, given the lack of competition and the growth prospects but we need to wait until they are listed. 

IMO  people should treat the stock market as you enter a casino and you expect one way or another the game to be rigged.you just hope that you strategy will get you some solid returns, but that is 40% of the game .

626,gytt3j7,2021-05-20,t1_gytnoih,StockMarket,"There is tax implications with realizing gains though.  So jumping in an out might not be the best strategy even if you sell only half.    And I disagree with selling half right now.    Now is not a logical peak considering it is off it's high by close to 40%.    

My issues is the timing of this.  Whether you sell half or not you are still trying to do the same thing.    You are trying to time the market and whether that works out or not is something else. But it is just a hedge when you sell half.   If that works for you then go for it.   Personally I believe in evaluating a company and buying in for the long haul.    But that really depends on the type of investor you or and what you believe the long term prospects are.    And the mistakes I made early on were more around trying to time the market then no realizing gains when i had some.    

2020 was a great example.    The boards are littered with people that tried to time Tesla and missed on a massive run up.  Or thought the run up was over and sold only to miss a 1000% gain.  Lets say you employed your strategy then.  Tesla basically ran from $85 per share at the low in March 2020 to $200 a couple months later in June.   And then there was a small pull back to $190.   Likely if you employed a sell half after it doubled you would have sold right there.   But then in the next two weeks the stock price went up another 50% to just over $300 a share before pulling back again (another possible sell point) and then by the end of august the price was $442 before another minor pull back and it trading in the same 370-440 range for awhile until November when the stock more then doubled again from low $400s to the high 800s before pulling back by early 2021.     

So while a sell half strategy would have been a great hedge normally if you did it with Tesla in 2020 you would have missed out on massive gains.    See it is easy for me to say this now because hindsight is what it is.   Just like it is easy to say that today you should sell half.   Just like what happened in 2020 the stock price could shoot back up so quickly that you miss out on the run up.    I mean you might have been happy with buying 500 shares at the low in March and then selling half in June after it had doubled but that would have been a spectacular bad move looking back at what happened.  And there are not going to be many people happy that they locked in a 100% gain on 50% of their investment when they could have gotten a 1000% gain on 100% of it.",[],1

\*\*\*My average in @ $5.10, currently at $5.52, May 20th, 2021

I am not investing in the company as a get-rich-quick scheme, but plan to hold long term. **Saphyr** technology will continue to improve directly with design improvements, but also indirectly with the data that it continuously collects will create more accurate correlations of DNA with individual predispositions for disease. 

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community. 

* **Large institutional investments have nearly tripled (3X) from 5% to 14%.** 
* **Earnings beat expectations in Q1 2021.**
* **Recent large insider procurement.**
* **New patents, research breakthroughs, Large Lab facility adoption.**

This is why I have a strong conviction for **Bionano Genomics (BNGO)** being a great growth stock to investigate and follow. 

There are some negative indicators fundamentally, but considering Bionano is still in its infancy I am very optimistic in my outlook. The positives tip the scale in my opinion and at the very least, Bianano Genomics (BNGO) should be on your watchlist!

**I look forward to the comments and welcome skeptical viewpoints. Open to hearing what other perceptions and expectations are of this company, Thanks for reading!!!!**

945,gyvfvdw,2021-05-20,t3_nhbx2p,StockMarket,"Absorption is the process of excess selling or buying taking place at a single price or series of prices but being absorbed by resting orders.

Absorption is first and foremost the result of willing buyers or willing sellers at key levels. They absorb excess supply or demand and often times create a stopping point and cause the market to test in the other direction. 

Absorption orders are very often present at key levels and confirm the importance of it by adding liquidity in the form of resting orders. Think of this however it best makes sense to you, but here are 2 examples. One buying and the other selling.
Buying Absorption - This is where large resting sell limit orders (sometimes in the form of iceberg orders) absorb excess buying.

Selling Absorption - This is where large resting buy limit orders (sometimes in the form of iceberg orders) absorb excess selling.

Absorption happens every single day in all markets but some are more important than others. Some occur at intraday swing levels and while others are often present at key tops and bottoms on longer time frames.",[],1

Users in the German wsb sub are also tracking the daily publicised trade numbers of the exchange to calculate the expected profits and resulting P/E. The full yearly report will be issued 28th May, then the numbers on yahoo will probably be adjusted at some point.


>I‚Äôd also be a little cautious about the 1000% stock price growth in the past year. 

Comparing against the number of trades, this could be considered fair. At the moment, the stock is actually trading at a comparatively low value. I guess this is due to uncertainty if the interest of young traders will persist or will be a fad. I believe it will remain high after covid times. I hold my stocks since 35‚Ç¨ and are still buying more on a regular basis. (I hold 85 shares currently).


>Also the debt level while just within the acceptable range is a bit concerning given their current negative enterprise value. What‚Äôre your thoughts on these concerns?

I think this might be due to the tax issue they had 2 years ago. A German law was changed and they needed to pay a lot in taxes but this has been reversed since as it was found the law is not applicable for their operation. Btw, they only have 70 employees and one office, so the running cost probably won't ever become unsustainable without some major events.",[],0
