101,2021-05-25,investing,"Amazon is nearing a deal to acquire MGM Studios, the co-owner of the James Bond franchise and other film and TV series, for between $8.5 billion and $9 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

The deal is expected to be announced as soon as Tuesday. The people asked not to be named because the talks are private.

It would mark Amazon’s biggest acquisition since it bought Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion.

The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Monday that the deal could be announced this week.

Amazon is interested in acquiring more TV and film content for its Prime Video service as it competes with Netflix, Disney and other streaming video services. MGM is a natural fit for any streaming service because of its plethora of content.

MGM, which is a private company, has been seeking a buyer for several years. Its owners include Anchorage Capital, Highland Capital Partners, Davidson, Kempner Capital Management, Solus Alternative Asset Management and Owl Creek Investments — funds that took control of the studio when it emerged from bankruptcy in 2010.

MGM owns a number of famed movie and TV franchises, including Rocky, Legally Blonde, The Pink Panther and Stargate. It also owns a studio, which has made more current hit TV shows, including “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “Fargo.”

MGM owns a number of popular reality TV shows, including “Shark Tank,” “Survivor,” “The Real Housewives” series and “The Voice.”

MGM also owns Epix, a premium pay-TV service valued at about $1.3 billion in 2017.",nkovd1,[],1

**Ocuphire Pharma has had 4 evaluations by analysts in 2021**, so these are recent, and all have given it a target price above 20. That would multiply the current price by roughly five. An any time we can have an investment multiply that way, it's worth looking into it.

**First, consider the risks:** this is a super small clinical stage pharma  with a small pipeline running mostly on one product/idea, at least in the near future. It's a risky investment. Do your own D/D. Also, tomorrow they are hosting a webinar, so you can listen firsthand and form an opinion.

Now for the D/D. Why are all analysts so optimistic about OCUP?

Well, anyone that has ever gone to the ophthalmologist to have their eyes/eyesight examined, will understand this one.

When we go to the eye dr., we are given eyedrops to enlarge our pupil. The black part of the eye. The black part of the eye, is like a hole. So the larger the hole, the better look the doctor can have into our eye. This is a VERY simplified explanation.

It takes at least 25 minutes for our pupil to dilate. After the exam, (anyone who has experienced it knows this), it takes a few hours for it to get back to normal. During those hours, we can't see well, our vision is blurred, we can't read a book, watch a screen or drive a car.

Some of us just take a bus home and wait it out. But for many of us, that time with blurred vision means we are going to miss more hours of work. That recovery time is worth money.

Well, currently there is no solution for this situation. You go to the eye doctor, your pupil is dilated, then you waist several hours after the visit waiting for your eyesight to recover.

**OCUP have developed the eyedrops antidote**. Very simple: eyedrops you receive at the end of the visit, which will bring your sight back to normal within roughly the same time frame it took for the pupil to dilate (about 20-25 minutes).

What this means is, anyone, worldwide, that goes to consult with an ophthalmologist, everyday, any day, that's the market for this product. 100 million visits pe year in the USA alone. And there is no alternative. They will OWN that market. Just imagine this: a product that every eye dr. around the world will have that will drastically improve the patient's experience by simply receiving some eyedrops that bring the eyesight to normal. You can go back to work, use the computer, drive etc.

That alone, is a good enough reason for betting on OCUP. That's worth billions. But it actually gets way better for four reasons:

1. This product has other uses, we are not going to get into all of them because they refer to more specific eye issues.
2. They are in Phase three, using a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.
3. There is an additional HUGE use for this product.
4. The current market cap is very very low.

**What the 505 pathway basically means** is that the active ingredient, the main ingredient of this new product has already received FDA approval, twice. So what OCUP does is use the data that already exists about this compound to avoid a lengthy approval path. In other words: it makes the approval of the product way faster. And after 7 very successful trials involving over 200 patients, they are in the last stages of moving towards an approval request (which, as explained, can be obtained much faster). So we are talking about approved product this year.

As for the other huge market for OCUP. OCUP is using the same technology they developed to apply it, with slight changes of course, to different situations. One such situation is presbyopia. Don't let the name scare you, it's very simple: the need for reading glasses. Pretty much everyone who reaches a certain age needs reading glasses. It's part of the process of getting old. **Almost 2 billion people worldwide suffer from it. That's how big the market is.**

**OCUP are creating something that never existed before**: eyedrops that will ""cure"" or delay presbyopia. Basically they can avoid, if not totally then partially, the need for reading glasses, simply by using eyedrops. A huge market, also with no real competitors.

I personally loved this find. I'm slowly increasing my position and waiting. It's a long position. It's not a company that creates huge news. So this is about buying cheap now and waiting. If the analysts are roughly right, we can quadruple our investment within 12 months. I'll take it. **Remember, it's a clinical stage bio pharm. It's risky!**",nks064,[],0

I've read that equities usually take a hit because it becomes more expensive for companies to borrow (so they borrow and invest less and are therefore estimated to have earnings decrease relative to some previous amount/projection, or they borrow the same but have to earn more of it to pay it back, which is harder for them to do or siphons profits from dividends/re-investment et cetera).

I've also read bond values in general take a hit because people don't want to hold a 10 year bond at 1.5% when they can hold a 10 year bond at 2% so they sell the lower-yield bond and there are fewer buyers so the price goes down and all that. Different bond durations react differently, but they all decline, at least temporarily.

If these two understandings are generally true, which usually gets hit worse from an interest rate increase, stocks or bonds? Or do they both get hit the same? Is there a duration element to the decline in value that each experiences, or is that the same as well?

Coinbase also expects to grant the initial purchasers of the notes a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $187.5 million principal amount of notes solely to cover over-allotments.

Revenue soared 135% to $119.7 million, well ahead of the 98% to 102% that it was [forecasting in early March](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/03/good-luck-betting-against-fubotv-stock/). This is the second time in a row that fuboTV has put up lowball guidance that it beat with ease. It's a trend that bears noting -- and respecting. 

There's still plenty of red ink here, but with operating expenses only up 80% relative to the 135% top-line burst we're seeing net loss and adjusted EBITDA margins improving. FuboTV's average revenue per user is rising, and against that welcome trend the live TV platform is clocking in with a sequential improvement in subscriber acquisition costs. 

We're seeing tailwinds riding tailwinds here. FuboTV now has 590,430 subs on its books, 105% more than it had a year earlier. Revenue is growing even faster on the heels of a 131% surge in subscription revenue and ad revenue more than tripling. Another neat tidbit on its subscriber count is that it's also 43,000 higher than it was in December. This is the first time that it actually posted a sequential increase in accounts during the first three months of the calendar year. 

FuboTV now sees 830,000 to 850,000 subscribers by year-end, up from the 760,000 to 770,000 it was targeting just two months ago. This is old hat for investors as fuboTV jacked up its 2020 subscriber goal in October, November, and January last time out. This should also be a reminder that any likely revision in a couple of months will probably be higher yet again.

With average revenue per user approaching $70 a month between subscriptions and ads, can things get even better? Well, fuboTV is still on track to roll out a free-to-play interactive gaming app that will enhance the live sports it streams through more than three dozen channels. The stakes will be raised in the fourth quarter when Fubo Sportsbook launches in markets where it can clear legal hurdles. Fantasy sports and then actual wagering will make fuboTV even more money than they are right now, but more importantly, they're going to improve engagement. 

FuboTV has been one of the wildest stocks since its [IPO](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/ipo-stocks/) seven months ago. It was a six-bagger at one point, only to shed more than three-quarters of its value by Tuesday's market open. A blowout quarter is the perfect cure to market indifference. Now it's up to fuboTV to make the most of its new momentum to start winning again.",nespkx,[],0

977,2021-05-18,investing,"**Deal Structure:**

The deal will be carried out in the form of the Reverse Morris Trust, which implies spinning off WarnerMedia into a separate company, let's call it NewCo (no official name yet), which will then merge with Discovery. As a result of the transaction, the share of the current AT&T shareholders in the new company will be 71%, and 29% of NewCo will be held by the current shareholders of Discovery. AT&T will receive $ 43 billion from the NewCo in return for the transfer of media assets (WarnerMedia) to NewCo. The structure of the transaction (Reverse Morris Trust) will eliminate the need for AT&T to pay income tax on the transfer of assets.

**Debt:**

The new company will own WarnerMedia, Discovery's current business, but it will immediately have $ 58 billion in debt ($ 43 billion from AT&T and $ 15 billion from Discovery). WarnerMedia and Discovery's combined EBITDA in 2020 was $ 12 billion (expected to grow to $ 14 billion by 2023). I would like to point out a negative point right away. At the close of the deal, the leverage of the new company will be 4.83x. However, the company plans to cut it to 3x by 2023. High leverage of NewCo, as well as uncertainty about NewCo's valuation, caused a correction in Discovery shares on this news. Management also expects operating synergies of $ 3 billion per year from the merger.

**Revenue and FCF:**

Discovery's revenue for 2020 is $ 10.4 billion, WarnerMedia's revenue was $ 30.4 billion. Total revenue for 2020 for the two companies is $ 40.8 billion. The new WarnerMedia & Discovery entity is projected to produce roughly $8.4 billion in free cash flow if you follow the free cash flow conversion guidance given in the announcement.

**Valuation:**

If you do the math, taking the share ownership of 71% AT&T holders and 29% Discovery holders and base the valuation of the new entity on the $43 billion price for Discovery's 29%, you get a total value for the new entity of roughly $105 billion or 12.5 times projected free cash flow of $8.4 billion.

Let's take multipliers for the entire media sector. The sector average EV / S multiplier is 4.38, excluding Netflix, the multiplier is 3.31. Netflix has the highest multiplier in this sector (8.6), which affects the calculation of the average multiplier in our sample. I take the EV / S multiple since the spread in the EV / EBITDA multiple is even more significant. Accordingly, 3.31 will be the lower bound of our estimate, and 4.38 will be the upper bound. The Enterprise Value range will then be from $ 135 to $ 179 billion. The market value of the new company will be equal to EV minus debt, that is, $ 77- $ 121 billion. The fair value of the Discovery share is $ 22.3-35 billion. vs current $16-18B (depends on the series DISCA/DISCK/DISCB), a 25-45% upside.

**What analyst say:**

* BofA estimates the combination is worth about $148B in enterprise value; correspondingly, it's staying Neutral on DISCA with a price target of $40 (now 22% upside from current price).
* Deutsche Bank calls the deal a ""clear positive"" for Discovery, and says it helps AT&T get back to core distribution. From Discovery's perspective, this is ""the deal we hoped they could get done"" and it should be highly effective in driving DTC subscriber and revenue growth at home and abroad.
* Bank of America estimates the new Discovery/WarnerMedia entity to be worth approximately $148 billion enterprise value. This attributes a 13.5x multiple to 2030E direct-to-consumer operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) discounted back and a 7.0x multiple on CY22E legacy OIBDA. When applying Discovery's 29% stake, this equates to an implied Discovery share price range of $39-42/share.

**Share classes:**

As for Discovery share classes, the spread is narrowing (between nonvoting DISCK to DISCA, to 7% from 15%). So now that the arbitrage is over DISCA should be going up along with DISCK. Not sure how DISCK will move - better avoid it as it's x2 of DISCA/DISCK and once the vote passes it may collapse...

Thoughts?

I'm a DISCA holder -> correction -> after much thought and investigation you should own DISCK.

DISCA and DISCK are common shares and the only difference is that DISCA has voting rights. Since the company is merging with another there is no voting value, and value of DISCA slowly erode while DISCK come closer until DISCA=DISCK. Currently there is a difference of 7% between them, so you can get this as well.

>How are things at the $2 billion deli?

>>Hometown International, the mystifying New Jersey deli company that is valued at nearly $100 million on the stock market — despite running just a single deli — has ousted its CEO, according to a financial filing. 

>>Paul Morina, a local high school principal and renowned wrestling coach in the area, was removed after a vote by majority shareholders, according to the late Friday filing.

>>Morina owns about 1.5 million shares of the Paulsboro-based company, which are worth more than $18.5 million based on the company’s current stock price. 

>>Shareholders of the company also ousted the company’s only other executive, vice president and secretary Christine Lindenmuth, who works in her day job with Morina as an administrator at Paulsboro High School.

>Here is the filing, from last Friday. It is not quite accurate to say — as the New York Post’s headline does — that shareholders fired Morina. It’s more that they demoted him. He lost a lot of titles:

>>On May 13, 2021, the Board removed Mr. Morina from all officer positions he held with the Company, including President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer of the Corporation, effective immediately as of such date. 

>But he still runs the deli:

>>Mr. Morina and Ms. Lindenmuth remain principals of the Company’s operating subsidiary, Your Hometown Deli, LLC.

>See, Your Hometown Deli is a deli in Paulsboro, New Jersey, that occasionally sells sandwiches, mainly to curious financial journalists. Hometown International Inc. is a U.S. public company, with a basic market capitalization of about $100 million and a fully diluted market cap of about $2 billion, that is some sort of mechanism for taking a foreign company public in U.S. markets and that also happens to own the deli. The $2 billion public company is now run by Peter Coker Jr., a Hong Kong-based financier who was already the chairman of the board and a major investor in Hometown International, and who “intends to devote his full time to seeking a business combination for the Company,” as the company said back in March. It makes sense that the mergers guy in Hong Kong would run the $2 billion company that’s in the business of merging with an Asian company, and the wrestling coach in New Jersey would run the local deli in New Jersey. Sensible division of labor! It was always weird to have the New Jersey wrestling guy in charge of the Asian merger company! Also it’s weird that they’re the same company.

>The deli has had some other good filings recently. Yesterday it disclosed that its quarterly report will be late, “because the Registrant needs additional time to complete certain disclosures and analyses to be included in the Report.” The relevant quarter ended on March 31, before Hometown became famous, so the problem is not that they sold so many sandwiches to so many financial journalists that their accounting systems couldn’t keep up. I assume that, given their recent scrutiny, everything just needs to be lawyered a bit more carefully than it has been in the past.

>Also here is an April 30 filing in which Hometown “disavows the price of its publicly quoted stock on the OTC Markets under the trading symbol ‘HWIN.’ Management is aware of no basis to support the Company’s stock price, based upon its revenue or assets.” I am not sure I have ever seen a company “disavow” its stock price before, but I suppose it makes sense. The filing accurately notes that “there has not been, nor is there, significant trading volume in the Company’s stock,” so it’s not like anyone is particularly getting ripped off by the deli’s weird stock price. It’s just a weird artifact. Still, probably best to disavow it.

979,2021-05-18,investing,"Passive investors say not to pick an outperforming mutual fund or ETF because you don’t know that it will outperform in the future. However, they look at market returns from the past to predict or expect returns in the future. Just because businesses have grown at a rate of 10% annually since 1926, why should investors expect 10% in the future?

It seems illogical to have your retirement rely on a system that is based on past performance from only the past 95 years. If a 20 year old starts investing today until retirement at 65, that’s 45 years. 45 years is 47% of the S&P 500’s existence, yet people say there’s enough evidence to expect a certain future return. If we had 1,000 years of historical data showing that the S&P returns 10% annually, I think that it would be ok to say that 10% can be expected for a 45 year window of retirement investing.

Saying that 10% returns can be expected in the future because thats what’s happened over the past 95 years is just using past performance to project future results.

>Not every business had the opportunity to transform/expand in the wake of Covid. Some businesses were well positioned to capitalize off of the pandemic and their stocks rallied as a result (DOCU, SPOT, ZM, etc...), however they are not all the best picks moving forward into 2021-2022. Still good picks long-term, but if we are comparing the possible return over the next 12-24 months, I believe they will be outperformed by the more cyclical stocks that will benefit off of the reopening. Disney was a weird one in that they were able to put their park operations on pause and focus on the expansion of their streaming services. They now sit at the helm of a huge content library in a world where streaming services are taking over the entertainment industry. Having this characteristic IN ADDITION to the incredible pricing power they have in their park and cruise-ships is largely what makes this stock/company so attractive to me right now.

>**Some technical analysis I believe is relevant** \- Over the period starting 2010 and ending 2015, the stock rose roughly 3x to highs of about $120/share from the $40 range. This was after a long consolidation period lasting approximately 10 years where the stock was unable to leave that $40 level. Once the stock was able to break out of the range it was in however, it rose in a nice bullish trend above the weekly 50 day MA for nearly 5 years. I noticed that it has now been in a consolidation period for about 6 years after reaching the highs of $120 in 2015. The highs of $120 were temporarily broken in 2019 with their expansion efforts and made highs of $150. Then Covid hits and the stock crashes to lows of $81. After recapturing the weekly 200 MA and consolidating for awhile along that $120 price level the stock broke out and posted new all time highs of $203. We are now coming back down to test for support along what was once a level of resistance (realistically could go as low as $150 before reversing). This is a pattern that plays out time and time again and seems to be in line with the company's growth as well as the growth we can expect to see over the years to come. I expect the growth spurts are closer together for a number of justifiable reasons. We are likely entering into another period of growth as they continue to firm up their streaming services and open their parks back up.

Disney's stock has shown solid growth in terms of EPS over the past 10 years, showing a small retracement in 2019 due to their various acquisitions and investments into Disney+, the expansion and continued development of HULU and ESPN+, and the integration of 21st Century FOX.

>I am certainly not an expert at valuing companies. I tend to spot trends and have a knack for thinking ""long-term"". I try to think about what might happen as things unfold. The overreaction the market saw in 2020 is being paid back now as the tech sector pulls back and attempts to find its footing. 2020 earnings were all over the place depending on what company we are talking about, but there were obviously some big winners. Most of the companies who saw huge earnings hikes will likely continue to grow at a reasonable rate in 2021 relative to the growth they saw every year prior to 2020 - still investors will sell stock after seeing earnings are down from 2020. How anyone could expect growth like that to be sustainable is beyond me. I figure it is just a bonus for these companies and they will be able to use the extra income to develop faster or combat inflation/economic troubles moving forward. It is not a gauge for future growth. 2020 was an anomaly...With this being said, Disney stock has been able to perform well over the past 12 months due to what I would call ""safe speculation"". Earnings were down big but the company is a behemoth - people know about Disney. Investors trust that the park will open back up and they will continue to do what they do. While a number of ""pandemic plays"" will be struggling to show revenue/growth anywhere near the levels of 2020, Disney earnings should be decent and should begin to level back off and stabilize. I believe a number of good companies will drop on good earnings this year until things level off.

>The company currently has a market cap of 308 billion. Keep in mind I said I am not expert at valuing companies. But with that being said, I do believe it is undervalued. Netflix alone is CURRENTLY valued at more than 215 billion with about 208 million paid subscribers. An article was released in Jan of 2020 stating that Barclays was valuing Disney+ at more than 100 billion alone. The service has added over 70 million paid subscribers since then, now totaling over 100 million paid Disney+ subscribers. The company anticipates around 230 to 260 million subscribers by 2024.

>Their direct-to-consumer segment includes HULU which has not been a huge profit generator, though I can personally attest to the fact that I would not even have Disney+ if it were not for HULU. Disney+/ESPN+ is not necessarily a package I would be interested in. The addition of HULU makes it worth it for me. I was already paying for HULU and figured it made sense to add the other 2 services for not much more $$$. Disney has agreed to take over the remainder of HULU from Comcast in 2024. I am interested to see what they do with it then.

What is pricing power and why is it important ? Pricing power simply put is a companies ability to raise their prices over time for their services. Not only is Disney continuing to offer more and more value to their customers, but they also run a number of theme parks with attractions that are confined to Disney alone. A tourist could not simply choose to go elsewhere for their Disney amusement park needs. Disney is the only place you can see Disney. We all know the feeling of walking into an airport or an amusement park and thinking ""welp, today I am going to be overpaying for everything"" - but that's just how it is and we accept it. In an inflation economy, pricing power is absolutely key and this company has it! They are also continually reinvesting into their brand which has helped them maintain strong momentum over the years.

This is a statement taken from a write-up by JPMorgan on pricing power -  **""Pricing power is one of the key attributes of a quality compounder. A key difference between a compounder and a cyclical company is that the compounder has the ability to sustain revenue even when demand in the economy contracts""**",nfipvu,['PLTR'],1
981,2021-05-18,investing,"Notes from Toyota Motors (TM) 2020 full year Earnings Call (13 May 2021)

Why do you care? Good question, automobile manufactures have gotten higher multiples (at least for a short time) based on producing, or moving closer to producing Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), and sometimes just by pretending they will change their name to emphasize Electrical terminology, and of course having a company named after the people who discovered how to make electricity work gets really high multiples (doesn’t work for utilities named after Edison though). Toyota has been reluctant to move into the BEV space, did this change? Will they rename themselves after Alessandro Volta? Let’s find out.

First, I really want to thank the modern world that can take spoken Japanese from multiple speakers and convert that into written English so cheaply that I can read it on the internet without a paid subscription to anything! It’s a wonderful time to be alive!

Oh, I guess it's fashionable to add a disclaimer so the black helicopters don’t come and lock me in a bank vault without my reading glasses or something right? Fine, I make my living breaking big atoms into little atoms so nothing I say or type should ever be considered medical, financial, legal, or romantic advice. Good enough? Let’s go.

I can’t find an old blog post I read in the 2009–2011-time frame to give credit, but it was pretty insightful, the blog author did a word search for “customer” in both the Amazon and IBM earnings call, and showed how Amazon (huge number of times saying “*customer*”) would be a better investment because that’s where their focus was compared to IBM which had very few hits for “customer”.  I haven’t checked, but I think Amazon has had slightly better returns than IBM from 2009-present.

CTRL-F for “*customer*” returns **53 hits** for TM, things like:

>“And Toyota is always listening to customers, always trying to develop products that are suitable for every part of the world. And we have to remember that the goal is not electric vehicles. The goal is carbon neutrality. And even if we have the best technology, if it's not chosen by customers, it will not have the impact of reducing emissions and that's the reason why we've chosen to have a full lineup, and we've invested in all of these technologies.”

Compare that to **their competitor**, the largest automobile manufacturer (**by market cap**) most recent earnings call shows just **10 hits** for “*customer*” with things like:

>“we had not yet begun customer deliveries”  
>  
>“what we obviously opt to do is to refund customers their deposit”  
>  
>“continue to accumulate bitcoin from transactions from our customers as they purchase vehicles”

Quite a difference in company philosophy!

Starting off with the prepared statement, this company is a beast! Their fiscal year begins and ends in March so this is for the entire Covid year without the benefit of the Jan-March 2020 pre-Covid or the reopening time after vaccinations ramped up, this is the worst possible time period and the sold 9.087 Million vehicles (96% of 2019 numbers) under the Toyota/Lexus name and an additional 7.646 Million consolidated vehicles (85.4% of 2019 numbers).

Quick note, they use the term “electrified vehicles” to include Hybrid (HEV), Plug in hybrid (PHEV) and battery electric (BEV) and Hydrogen Fuel Cell electric (FCEV). The sales of electrified vehicles were 112.3% of 2019, which I think were mostly HEVs.

They went through all the various gains and losses to operating income (currency exchange rates, marketing, cost reductions) and overall operating income went UP by 10 Billion (JPY not USD). Then announced the dividend at a payout ratio of 29.8%. Announced a resumption of share buybacks (had been suspended during the pandemic) of up to 250 BILLION (JPY). Also, a five for one stock split will happen on September 30 2021.

Next the future projections, consolidated 113% of 2020, Toyota/Lexus 105.6% of 2020, and expected 2.8 Million electrified cars 129% of 2020 (29.2% of vehicles sold will be electrified). Again, a breakdown of predicted expenses with an overall prediction an operating income increase 365 Billion (with a B, in JPY)!!

Next, they took questions. First question wanted more detail on predicted finances which they answered, then a very detailed discussion of the plan:

>“By 2050, we are to realize carbon-neutral. That is our target. The new vehicle CO2 is not the point. Transport use -- this overall cycle of CO2 use will have to be made neutral. That will be the point. So at this point, rather than restricting or limiting the types of technologies to be used, in order to realize carbon neutrality, various options or various technologies will have to be addressed. We think that will be the most important point and that is where Toyota is putting its entire efforts in. More specifically, we at Toyota has HEV, PHEV, battery EVs or BEVs or FCEVs”

From later in the call, but I wanted to move it here since it explains how they define the term:

>“What does carbon neutrality actually mean for the automotive industry? Carbon neutrality for the automotive industry means achieving zero CO2 emissions in all processes throughout the lifecycle of manufacturing, transporting, operating, fueling and/or charging, and recycling and disposing of vehicles.”

Then they discuss very specific breakdown of anticipated sales of electrified vehicles by region by 2030 and:

>“And globally, this will add up to 8 million electrified vehicles, including hybrids, out of which battery EVs and FCEVs in total would account for about 2 million units. That is our plan. Of course, ultimately, the choice is up to the customer. But at this moment, this is what we are forecasting.”

Followed by a detailed discussion about the scope of the challenge for future battery production and:

>“at the moment, Toyota's supplied power is 6 gigawatts hours. And in order to realize these numbers, 180 gigawatt hours is necessary; in other words, 30 times the current number. So if you translate that into EV production lines, currently, we have two lines, but that will have to be more than 60 lines, that is more than 30 times. So we will make aggressive investments so that we can realize that. And in addition to that, for battery development or basic units will be reduced, and we will work with alliance partners for procurement so that we can procure the necessary goods. And in addition to that, for battery EV development, compared to the current situation, 15% to 30% reduction in development lead time is to be aimed at. “

And

>“So for the investments, electrification case, digitalization, roughly speaking, on an annual basis, we are currently making an investment of JPY 1 trillion. This year, compared to the past levels, we intend to increase investment by 20%”

Did you notice that number, Trillion! I ran out of fingers and toes to count how many zeros that was.

Next the BIG question: “**how do you see the supply demand forecast for semiconductors**?”

Well:

>“The supply demand situation still can fluctuate and we cannot sit back and relax yet, but we are not forecasting a major impact by semiconductors”

Compare that to **their competitor**, the largest automobile manufacturer (**by market cap**) most recent earnings call:

>“yes. This quarter, and I think we'll continue to see that a little bit in Q2 and Q3. So Q1 was -- had some of the most difficult supply chain challenges that we've ever experienced in the life of Tesla and same difficulties with supply chain, with parts -- over the whole range of parts. Obviously, people have heard about the chip shortage.  
>  
>This is a huge problem.”

Am I just cherry picking, trying to sensationalize something for clicks? Well, here is **what Ford had to say** in their earnings call:

>“The semiconductor shortage and the impact to production will get worse before it gets better. In fact, we believe our second quarter will be the trough for this year. We have worked to do to get our industry footprint back to firing on all cylinders or maybe should I say fully charged. Overall, though, I'm proud of the progress we made as a team, as our underlying strength at Ford improves”

Then another important question “you also showed the outlook for carbon neutral for 2030, and you talked about 6 million, and your plan was to increase carbon-neutral vehicles and PHEV. And could you share with us the reason why you believe customers will be choosing those vehicles?”

Remember the customer! Here’s part of their answer:

>“And for 2030, for one thing, as Mr. Kamisawa mentioned in his own question, the battery EV, its prices and availability of infrastructure on the global situation is not likely to progress significantly.

>But I would like to add further to that question about the Japanese data. We are focused on connectivity or connected. And through connected network, we obtain information and data on vehicles. And even in the case of hybrid EVs or plug-in hybrid EVs, especially in urban areas, the distance traveled by electric mode is quite long. And probably, we can share with you later on, but in the urban areas, generally speaking, there is some difference between urban area and suburban areas, but in urban areas, even in the case of hybrid electric vehicles, about 50% of the times, it is running on the electric mode.

>And in the case of PHEV, of course, there are differences in conditions, but 70% or 80% of the times, it is driven on pure electric mode. So hybrid EVs or plug in hybrid EVs, not just their performance and also the data that we can obtain through connectivity, and also, we use information we obtain from navigations. And using that, depending upon where the vehicle is located, the EV mode ratio can be increased or decreased, so adjusted. And those can be doable in the future through hybrid vehicles as well as plug-in EVs. So we would like to make contribution to the environment in a sustainable manner as well as practical manner.”

What's Tether?

USDT is a ""stablecoin"" -- a cryptocurrency whose price is supposed to be pegged to the US dollar -- managed by a company called tether.

Initially tether said they enforced the peg by having each USDT be backed by a USD in a bank account. Then tether ran into all sorts of hilarious hijinks over the years, many of which we only found out because they [were made public in NYAG litigation](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlement_agreement_-_execution_version.b-t_signed-c2_oag_signed.pdf), including:

* Having all of tether's money in their lawyer's personal bank account (May 2017)
* Not having any bank account anywhere in the world for 6 monthsto receive money in. Yet still emitting $400m new tethers in that period. Their lawyer's personal account had, at most, $60m at any point. Bitfinex had two institutional deposits in that whole period, neither of whom purchased USDT.
* Failing to complete an audit and settling on an attestation (An audit verifies where money comes from. An attestation is just an accoutnant saying ""there was money in a bank account on that date"") for ""transparency"". The morning of the attestation, tether moved $380m from sister company bitfinex into a bank account the morning of the day of the attestation.
* Losing $900M to their money launderer, and covering those losses by commingling bitfinex customer funds with tether reserve funds (2018)
* Finding the last bank on earth, [Deltec Bank from Bahamas](https://www.deltecbank.com/) willing to do business with them after Wells Fargo and HSBC fired them as clients. Remember HSBC has the kind of risk tolerance leaving them to [willingly deals with drug cartels](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/hsbc-moved-vast-sums-of-dirty-money-after-paying-record-laundering-fine/). No bank wants tether as a client.

Just read section 2 and 3 of the NYAG settlement. It's a blast. The best recap on the tether saga is by [Amy Castor](https://amycastor.com/2019/01/17/the-curious-case-of-tether-a-complete-timeline-of-events/), but [Patrick McKenzie](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/10/28/tether-and-bitfinex/) also has a good write up. Note that Patrick's piece is quaint now -- it was written back in 2019 when tether's balance sheet was $2B. Tether now has over [$58B on their balance sheet](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.28.53-PM-1024x585.png)

As far as we know, there was no point in history at which USDT in circulation were backed 1-to-1 by USD in a bank account. At this point, they stopped even pretending -- each tether in circulation is backed by... [tether's ""reserves"".](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reserves.gif)

The ""Reserves""

For a long time, tether's ""reserves"" were a mystery. As found in the NYAG investigation, tether likely never had a dollar in a bank account for each USDT, at any point, ever. They're now forced to reveal the makeup in May 2021 as per the NYAG settlement. Tether found a 5-person accounting firm in the Cayman islands willing to do an [attestation](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tether-assurance-feb-2021.pdf), which states they have 0.36% more assets than liabilities.

In anticipation for their forced public disclosure, tether recently posted this [glorious pie chart](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/glorious_pie_chart-1024x769.png)

Which [has](https://protos.com/tether-pie-chart-usdt-dollar-pegged-crypto-stablecoin-dollar-value/) [prompted](https://bennettftomlin.com/2021/05/13/for-every-1-of-tether-there-are-0-03-in-cash/) [many](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tether-first-breakdown-shows-token-120000439.html) [more](https://www.ft.com/content/529eb4e6-796a-4e81-8064-5967bbe3b4d9) [questions](https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2021/05/13/tether-publishes-two-pie-charts-of-its-reserves/). First, we can view the actual debt in this form, as [broken Intel Jackal](https://twitter.com/intel_jakal) ([image](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/piechart.png))

Almost all of the reserves are in some form of loan to a commercial company (corporate bonds, commercial paper, secured loans). Only around 5% are in assets whose value we know (cash, T-Bills).

Inconsistencies

Tether's general counsel, Stuart Hoegner, posted a [highly unusual blog post](https://stuarthoegner.medium.com/tether-is-setting-a-new-standard-for-transparency-and-responding-to-criticism-that-is-fc130e08319b) in which he claims this is good debt by any standard. This raises many inconsistencies, which are easy to see given the magnitude of the numbers at hand.

* Stuart claims they don't hold Treasury Bills because the interest rate is close to 0%. If they hold this risky debt as reserves because it pays higher interest, **why does tether only have 0.36% more assets than liabilities?** Either thether's management is looting the interest rates on the assets and leaving USDT holders with the debt's risk, or we're being lied to.
* With $20B in commercial paper at the time of the attestation, and 50% more USDT on the market since, tether presumably has **$30B in commercial paper** at time of writing. The [entire commercial paper market](https://sec.gov/files/primer-money-market-funds-commercial-paper-market.pdf) in the US is around $1T per year.

We're supposed to believe that **tether somehow holds 3% of the US commercial paper market** at time of writing, and that they *apparently bought 1% of the entire market in the last month alone*.

* The asset allocation strategy in the reserves seems to be [copied from](https://twitter.com/intel_jakal/status/1394562510070583296) an investment fund at tether's bank, Deltec. This investment fund apparently manages $425M, rather than $60B.
* If the reserves are such regular financial assets, how come respectable accounting firms won't even touch it for a simple attestation?

We know that some of the money used for USDT come from Chinese money laundering because a tether shareholder [was recently charged](https://protos.com/china-crypto-otc-king-zhao-dong-criminal-charges-court-docs-show/). But we see no mention of frozen accounts in the reserves. Moreover, this amounts to less than $0.5B, and the perpetrator was nicknamed the ""Chinese OTC King"" -- so even in the charitable case where USDT are fully backed by money laundering, this raises inconsistencies.

Reminder: non-USD reserves for a stablecoin are a problem

As noted by [Frances Coppola](https://www.coppolacomment.com/2021/05/tethers-smoke-and-mirrors.html), it's dangerous to guarantee to clients that something is worth $1 when your assets backing it are not dollars. The value of the USD changes very little. The value of crypto changes a lot.

If you want to enforce a market price of $1 for something backed by not-dollars, then the quantity of reserves needs to go up and down with the asset price changes. Otherwise, you'll eventually become insolvent, when asset prices become lower than what you bought them for.

Who are these loan to?

Tether has lost the privilege of the benefit of doubt a long time ago. Here is how tether's Ponzi scheme likely works:

* All their commercial debt is to the related exchanges (Binance, FTX, Bitfinex - see below) or their affiliated shell companies.
* Tether make new USDT out of thin air and send them against a dollar-denominated loan to these affiliates
* The affiliates use the new USDT to put market buy-orders for crypto, putting them on the new USDT on market
* Crypto goes up in value becaue of the new demand pressure. This overcollateralizes the affiliated loans, justifying more loans.
* Rinse, repeat.

We can track who new USDT go to directly by looking at their [TRON](https://tronscan.org/#/address/TKHuVq1oKVruCGLvqVexFs6dawKv6fQgFs/transfers), [ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5754284f345afc66a98fbb0a0afe71e0f007b949#tokentxns), [OMNI](https://omniexplorer.info/address/1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz) and [Solana](https://explorer.solana.com/address/Q6XprfkF8RQQKoQVG33xT88H7wi8Uk1B1CC7YAs69Gi) blockchain addresses. By matching the blockchain addresses new USDT are sent to to known parties, we can track who are the ones sending [new USDT on the market:](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tether-to-exchanges-1024x530.png)

The counterparties are largely Binance, FTX, Bitfinex, and other exchanges. The commercial paper is presumably to affiliated shell companies. I wouldn't put those companies debt at a dollar-to-dollar valuation; for instance [Binance is currently under investigation by the DOJ and IRS](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/binance-probed-by-u-s-as-money-laundering-tax-sleuths-bore-in).

But how does the $1 peg hold?

This is an easy one. [FTX happily admits to enforcing the dollar peg](https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1348773044873949185) ([image](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.12.17-PM-861x1024.png))

You can easily enforce the dollar peg by wash-trading around the $1 price and arbitraging on exchanges who don't.

FTX don't even need to be complicit to the scheme for this to make financial sense: if FTX can get new USDT for $1 on an infinite loan margin from tether, it's perfectly sensible to buy USDT when it's below $1 and shortsell USDT when it's above.

The Mississippi bubble, 2021 style

The cryptocurrency ecosystem is conceptually simple. Money comes in from new investors buying, and the same money comes out to pay those cashing out. It would be a zero-sum ecosystem, except for the fact that miners have to pay their [bills in dollars](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/crypto_is_simple.png)

This is why ""bitcoin investors"" feel an immediate urge to tell everyone else to invest in bitcoin -- if no new money comes in, the financial structure eventually collapses under the miner's sell pressure.

Note how this is different than buying a company's stock. People buy and sell stocks on a stock exchange, but the companies independently have money coming in (from their clients). The stock of a profitable company is a positive-sum ecosystem. If somehow no one wants to buy the stock, a profitable company will be happy to buy it back itself.

When tether comes in with their scheme, they put demand pressure on BTC then add a supply constraint on BTC (also driving up the price!) by reducing the total supply of BTC to [hoard in their reserves](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/crypto_is_usdt.png)

Notice that even though bitcoin prices are higher, **no additional money entered the ecosystem** in the tether pump. Like a Ponzi scheme, we *cannot pay everyone off at the inflated price* using the pool of money that's in the crypto ecosystem (More specifically, the pool of money in the crypto exchange's customer fund bank accounts) When enough money starts looking for the exit door, a $60B hole gets torn into the ecosystem, and [someone has to pay for it.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/masterpiece.gif)

The danger zone happens when BTC drops below $18,500

Assuming that each new USDT is used to instantly buy BTC at market prices (This is a lower bound estimate, since USDT are issued on the market between mint periods, where price is increasing), we can track where the BTC ""price of no return"" is -- where reserve BTC were paid for [more overall than they're now worth.](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tether_insolvency_point.png)

We can play around with parameters (they might buy ETH or Dogecoin rather than BTC, etc.) but most calculations land the death zone in the $17k-$20k range -- prices we were at around December 2020.

The scheme can easily collapse above this point. Bernie Madoff's customer deposits was around $18B against a $65B promised liabilities, but his scheme collapsed way before $40B in funds were withdrawn, because fraudsters tend to mismanage and embezzle some of the money for themselves.

Notice that the last point in time where BTC price went significantly below the death zone is the March 2020 COVID price crash -- which is also the point where USDT were started to be minted at a parabolic rate.

The DeFi boom started with the USDT flood

This is a sidenote to this story, but the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) boom started because of USDT flooding the market. DeFi is not a new invention: it's existed since the 2017 bubble. No one picked it up because it's a fairly useless idea: lock up more collateral for a crypto loan than the loan's value and use the loan.

DeFi is exclusively used to leverage trading - eg. lock up BTC, keep the BTC exposure, and use the loan to buy more BTC. You can't buy a house or start a business on a DeFi loan -- the point of normal loans is to use personal creditworthiness and **under**collateralization to move future cashflows into the present. For these reasons, [no one picked it up for years](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-11.16.05-PM-1024x497.png)

But notice something happened around the same time as USDT exploded. We can track what happened to DeFi by getting historical borrowing rates and matching them to total money in DeFi (TVL), USDT in [DeFi and total USDT](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/defirates-1024x512.png)

A clear story emerges:

No one used DeFi until tether joined the Ethereum blockchain in April 2019. Then a ton of new tethers, with no particular place to go, found themselves emitting DeFi loans. This floored the borrowing rates for DeFi, especially so in April 2020, after tether started printing themselves out of insolvency.

Once borrowing rates were appealing, DeFi started taking off.

Eventually, the DeFi ecosystem tried to distance itself from USDT, but the coin is still around 45% of the entire space.

USDT DeFi loans are generally USDT-denominated. If the USDT peg breaks significantly, these USDT DeFi loans will go into margin call one way or another.

The noose is tightening

At the time of writing, BTC crashed from a high of $64k to around $41k (now 38k). But more importantly, for the first time in months, we're starting to see **significant backflows** into tether addresses, largely from Binance. Here are the outflows and inflows (excluding newly minted USDT) into the tether address [on Tron, for example](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/death-1024x567.png)

The orange lines are USDT coming out onto market. The blue lines are USDT coming back into tether's blockchain address.

This is means people are recently withdrawing, a lot. The music could stop at any moment now. It could take hours, or it could take months.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Not from the copy paste: I want to add to this, on the day of Elon's initial tweet about Tesla not accepting bitcoin, there was a drastic spike of bitcoin coming into exchanges JUST PRIOR to the tweet. Was this Elon, someone he told, or just a lucky trade? Who knows. However, after the tweet there was a sudden move of 650 million tether (so $650m)  onto exchanges to BUY bitcoin as the price was collapsing and this stabilized the price. In my opinion tether is being used to inflate BTC but unlike the federal reserve tether cannot print $$$$. **Oh, and tether clearly states they do NOT guarantee any redemption of dollars to holders of tether.** IE they are not assured you can trade a tether for a dollar like other stable coins

&#x200B;

I would recommend avoiding BTC until tether is fully audited and we know what companies that commercial paper is from.",ng3im3,[],0
990,2021-05-19,investing,"How one approach diversification, considering this ?

1. S & P 500 might be in bubble considering current and historical PE
2. USA is still great, probably best country in the world, with many good companies. But USA is challenged by China and in next decades Asia will simple have higher growth of GDP. 
3. USD is world reserve currency and by far most traded currency. However importance of dollar might decrease 

S&P PE ratio is high currently. If it gets bellow 20, I would be exposed more. Probably 70% to 80%. If S&P PE ratio goes to 90 +, i would cut index and buy big cap companies with low PE

However most of world is still garbage. Including China

One way to go around this, is invest in competitive industries abroad, where Americans lost edge.

For example semiconductors in Taiwan and Korea. They profit from China growth, yet is a industry which Chinese will not control in next decade or two. However I wouldn't be comfortable buying whole market index there. Anyway both governments (Korean and Taiwanese) heavily subsidies semiconductors. So bet on whole semiconductor industry, is actually bet on their government too. Their currencies, especially TWD is super stable (look Taiwan forex reserve).

When bet on Japan, i would go for dividend stock index in Japan. Many great, big stable companies with 4 % dividend

And I would consider betting on index in India, cause whole market will raise up crazy in next 30 year.

I still work up my portfolio but roughly idea is:

- 50% american stocks (market ETF)
- 15% Taiwanese and Korean semiconductors (ETD for semiconductor)
- 15 % India (market ETF)
- 10 % EU (Just 2 companies Airbus, Volkswagen. Again bet on them is betting on EU)
- 10 % Japan (either dividend index or I would pick 5 dividend stocks)

So I am covered for currencies risk, plus betting on India. As well having mix of ETF and few stocks i personally pick up. And in Japan I cover dividend stocks

I have nothing against blockchain tech on its own. I think there are some wonderful aspects to the technology. With that said, the amount of narratives used to sell bitcoin to others that are just completely wrong on a variety of levels is getting to be rather stupid. And given today's selloff, it's a good opportunity to explain how the narrative is completely disconnected from reality.

**Bitcoin As Inflation Protection = Bad Narrative**

I have said for a long time that bitcoin is a RISK ASSET. It's yet another in a long line of strong performing financial assets that have done well in our environment of excess liquidity and low inflation. In this light, it's not that different from the growth investing asset class.

If bitcoin actually served as any form of inflation protection, then why in the world did it tank 12% on the day that we got the highest YOY CPI print in over a decade? And nobody can argue that it was a product of interest rates rising... since they haven't risen in any significant way since that inflation print. And it's now tanked almost 40% at a time when you would expect any idea of inflation protection to be the strongest driver of the asset class. Something... doesn't add up here.

Why make up incorrect beliefs to justify purchasing something, when there are perfectly reasonable bull cases to be made that aren't dependent on misleading people on the economics of inflation and ""money printing""? And for whatever it's worth, Gold suffers from some of the same problems, although it obviously behaves a bit differently than crypto.

**Bad Economic Narratives Dominate Bitcoin Beliefs**

* How many times do people need to show you M2 charts before they actually take a minute and compare M2 to the actual inflation levels? Hint for those who aren't aware, growth in M2 is 100% meaningless if it causes an equivalent drop in the velocity of money.
* How many times do people need to call quantitative easing ""money printing"", without understanding how quantitative easing actually works? Hint: the ""money printing"" comes from temporary fiscal stimulus, not from the fed pushing reserves that are never used onto banks' balance sheets.
* How many times do people misunderstand that ""asset inflation"" (which is just another word for a bubble) is different than consumer price inflation? Hint: Real consumer price inflation is typically rather negative for more speculative risk assets (such as bitcoin).
* How many times do people need to suggest the US dollar is ""getting killed"" before they actually look at a price history chart of the US Dollar? Hint: the US dollar is more or less right in the middle of it's price range over the last 50+ years, is significantly higher than it was throughout the entire time period from 2005-2015, and hasn't even dropped that far this year despite the massive amount of stimulus + fed swap lines used since the Covid pandemic. You would think that if the US dollar was ***actually*** debasing, we would get more than a 5% drawdown during the largest stimulus package ever. 

&#x200B;

My personal subjective opinion is that Bitcoin is yet another risk asset that benefits largely from too much money chasing too few assets. This IS actually in part a product of quantitative easing, but the irony here is that QE is not actually causing inflation. I think blockchain will likely be used in the future for a wide variety of uses, but I have no clue whether Bitcoin will serve any actual functions aside from speculative ownership. Note: I do not own any crypto or crypto-oriented stocks, so I don't have anything to either gain or lose here.

And by the way, this is not intended as a bullish or bearish post on bitcoin. Just trying to debunk some of the very obviously incorrect narratives that have been sold to the public over the years.",ngamt2,[],0

Under this program, which is designed to return value to AMD stockholders, offset dilution from stock issuances, and reduce share count over time, the company will repurchase stock in the open market. This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.",ngavio,[],0

This seems like a risky but interesting arbitrage play given the prices of Discovery shares and the high likelihood the merger will go through.

Discovery currently has three classes of shares:

Discovery Class A (DISCA) trading at $33.11

Discovery Class B (DISCB) trading at $77.98

Discovery Class C (DISCK) trading at $31.04

DISCA is voting stock, DISCB is supervoting stock and DISCK is nonvoting stock. DISCB has too small a float to short safely but going long DISCK and short DISCA seems a reasonable arb. Thoughts ?",ngj9q3,[],0
995,2021-05-20,investing,"New Investor - Everything I've read says to buy a mutual fund with low expense ratios as the fees add up and you compound more money with lower fees. 

While I understand and agree with the previous statement, I am conflicted. When comparing a fund with a 0.015% expense ratio vs one with 0.7%, the fund with higher expense ratio comes out ahead when it out performs the lower expense ratio fund by 0.625%. 

When looking at Fidelity mutual funds it appears that most funds with a higher expense ratios out perform ones with lower expense ratios by significantly more than 0.625%. Examples:

&#x200B;

**Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX):** 

\-Expense ratio 0.015%, 1yr +45.97%, 5yr +23.41%, 10yr +14.16%

**Fidelity Select Software and IT Services Portfolio (FSCSX)**

\-Expense ratio 0.7%, 1yr +51.28%, 5yr +28.61%, 10yr +21.23%

&#x200B;

In this example, and in several higher expense ratio mutual funds I looked at, it appears beneficial to pay the higher expense ratio. I do know I'm not accounting for risk here but, being youngish, I am not too worried about it at this point. I also understand the 1 year growth is a bad marker of growth due to the COVID.

Drone Delivery Canada Corp. (TSXV: FLT; OTC QX: TAKOF; Frankfurt:  A2AMGZ or ABB.F) (the “Company” or “DDC”) is pleased to announce that, with the assistance of its sales agent Air Canada  (TSX: AC), it has been selected by the University of British Columbia (“UBC”) to deploy DDC’s patented drone delivery solution at the Stellat’en First Nation, for UBC’s “Remote Communities Drone Transport Initiative” program.

 

The project will enable defined-route deliveries utilizing DDC’s Sparrow drone and its DroneSpot® takeoff and landing zones as well as additional drone flight infrastructure as required.  The solution will be used to transport a variety of cargo for the benefit of the Stellat’en First Nation, located in the Fraser Lake area of Central Northern British Columbia, Canada.

 

DDC and UBC will work towards finalizing a definitive agreement shortly.  DDC is expected to commence deployment of site infrastructure summer of 2021 and expects to begin providing drone delivery services under the agreement in the second half of 2021. The drone project term is expected to be 12 months. This deployment will be DDC’s fourth First Nations project and its first in British Columbia.

 

All operations will be conducted in accordance with appropriate Canadian regulations. Flights will be remotely monitored by DDC from its Operations Control Centre located in Vaughan, Ontario.

 

“We look forward to working with Drone Delivery Canada and all partners on this project for the benefit of the Stellat’en First Nation.  Many First Nations communities in B.C. are on lockdown to reduce transmission of COVID-19, which has exacerbated inequitable access to health care supplies and services, ranging from personal protective equipment and medications to laboratory services such as COVID-19 testing and diagnostics for other medical conditions,” said Dr. Michael Allard, Vice-Dean, Health Engagement & Partnerships, UBC.

 

“Based on the isolated location of our community and the needs of our residents, drone transport may enhance our access to COVID-19 testing and medication without traveling and endangering other members of our community,” said Chief Robert Michell of the Stellat’en First Nation, located about 100 kilometres west of Prince George. “The futuristic potential of this initiative is exciting. With drone technology, there is so much you can do.”

 

“We are pleased that UBC has chosen Drone Delivery Canada as part of their ‘Remote Communities Drone Transportation Initiative’ at the Stellat’en First Nation. The UBC Faculty of Medicine is a recognized global leader and we applaud their initiative to embrace drone delivery to benefit First Nations communities. As an award-winning global leader, DDC is pleased with our continued business successes in the drone delivery industry,” said Michael Zahra, President & CEO of DDC.",nh1ol9,[],1

>Core CPI jumped to 3.0 percent year-over-year in April, the fastest pace since 1996. While the base effect from low readings in April 2020 was widely expected by markets, the monthly pace of inflation also rose notably. Core CPI increased 0.92 percent from March to April, the largest monthly gain since 1981.

>The market seems to think this may be the start of an enduring trend of higher inflation, given record fiscal stimulus, ultra-easy Federal Reserve (Fed) accommodation, and ongoing supply bottlenecks. But a closer look at the data suggests that this spike in prices is a one-time adjustment as the economy reopens.

>Spooked bond investors pulled forward Fed rate hike expectations after the CPI release, despite the Fed repeatedly emphasizing that they view this reopening-induced rise in prices as transitory. Investors should believe the Fed when they say they will look through this temporary inflation noise and fade the bond selloff.

>The month-to-month gains in the core CPI were largely driven by a few small categories related to economic reopening and temporary pandemic-induced shortages. 54 of the 92 basis point increase came from used cars, rental cars, airfares, and hotels, despite these categories having a weight of just 5 percent in the core CPI basket. The contribution was so large because the monthly price increases were so huge (e.g. 10 percent gain in used car prices). These increases are unlikely to be sustained beyond the next few months, especially once prices in depressed categories recover back to the pre-COVID trend.

>To the Fed, what matters is the trend in the larger, more durable inflation categories that influence the longer-term inflation outlook. In those categories, sequential inflation was much more muted: rents (including owners’ equivalent rent) and healthcare services contributed just 8 basis points to the monthly gain, despite making up 49 percent of the core CPI index. The Fed is more focused on the chart below than the chart above—and the bond market should be too.
