67,gymzobo,2021-05-19,t1_gymw43i,wallstreetbets,"I think that I didn't explain very clearly what it is that I'm trying to assert.

Others agree there *have been* other worlds and that man is *as God once was* but believe that there isn't more than one world like ours progressing at this time; rather, that it is more of a *sequential* cycle.

As for the existence of aliens, those that subscribe to the second point of view would agree that God the Father is by definition an alien, but that there are not *others* because the Celestial beings/angels/messengers from outer space are originally from Earth (or, you could argue, from Heaven, but if we're going there, one could also say that that is where *we* are from as well, prompting a clear, no-nonsense definition of what exactly qualifies as an ""alien"").

In any event, the belief that there are, right now, *aliens like us* or *other worlds like ours* is what I am claiming to not be *doctrinal* but *speculative.*",[],1

I'm not going to do it for you.  But I think any reasonable person would want to make sure their organization is on stable financial ground, not spending every last dollar they have.  

Being on this thread I would think you would understand that the more money you have invested the more you will have available to use in the future.  Cashing out is only wise if it helps you achieve your future financial goals.  In this case keeping money invested means more available in the future, and more people can be helped.

So what looks like a miniscule amount of charitable donations, may be the most the church feels comfortable pulling, while saving for other future and potentially larger catastrophes.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

The abstractions that are used to build modern software is so drastically different from what was done in the 90s, you're going to set yourself up for failure if you hold these standards today. Consider something as simple as keyboard inputs on modern OSes. There is a substantial delay compared to the nearly instantaneous action you would have had in 1990.

Now take this abstraction further. Spotify routinely has issues with their software updates. How often does aws-east1 go down? So much for five 9s. Github takes a massive dump monthly now. Comcast has taken down entire regions with cable cuts. Companies have compromised the entire adult US population identities. Give me an industry and I'll give you example of market leaders shitting the bed ranging from trivial issues to something as complex as solar radiation hitting a server rack causing a company millions in losses because some bit randomly flipped.

Sorry dude, but getting upset at a leap year calculation is just another convenience of modern software development. Yeah it sucks but it doesn't discount anything I've said. Unless companies start feeling repercussions from writing shitty software, which they won't, nothing will change.",[],0

You attend meetings in some dude's basement that you're pretty sure is used for either ritual sacrifices or weird sex shit based on how it's dimly lit by candles and the iron handcuffs hanging from the ceilings. You roll your eyes every time the guy in the blood red cloak and hood talks about the rewards you'll receive in the afterlife if you just pledge your loyalty and donate your wealth to the cult. Your friends and family all make fun of you and call you a dumbass. 

A couple months later, you don't know how things got so out of hand but you're being pressured by the entire cult to drink the cyanide-laced Kool-Aid with them so you can all ascend to the promised land. You decide fuck it, you already lost your life savings in OTM FD's and the rest went to the cult so you could keep banging the same chick, who's been passed around multiple other members, and you've been pretty depressed so what do you have to lose? You chug down your portion out of a plastic Chuck-e-Cheese mug and then die in agony.

All of a sudden you wake up in the muscular arms of the god Thor. He whispers into your ears, ""It was all true, welcome to Valhalla."" He leads you to your yacht where you find 100 big bosomed women, every single one the gorgeous you've ever seen, and all desperate to snort your unlimited supply of cocaine off your massive 12"" penis.

I’ve been wondering a lot about the effect that our thoughts have on the world. If a bull is wrong about a SPY call, does he lose his horns? If a bear is wrong about a TSLA put, where do his teeth go? As I’ve pondered among the roadside, wandering down the beaten path; I have come the conclusion that the only way to be is to be a butterfly. A butterfly is always right in flight in search of it’s sugar water for the night, and when we know this; I think the next question is upon whose 🍆 with the 🦋 land?

Turns out the wage stagnation was artificial all along. Companies just took reasonable increases for employees and gave them to executives. Even not taking all of the difference so the company can still look like it was more profitable YoY *on paper,* and so shareholders were like ""more of that.""

Then we got more of that..... for what, 30+ years now or something like that?

That's why companies *LOVE* immigrants, especially illegal ones, and foreign outsourcing. Because when Americans started asking ""Yo why do I need 10 years of experience and 3 PhDs to clean bathrooms for 8/hr"" Companies were like ""Ok, Pedro. I saw you hop over the fence, clean my bathrooms for 8/hr under the table and I won't report you to CBP?"" And since they don't have to pay taxes or SS it's *still* a cost reduction.

I realized how much the entire country was getting fleeced by corporate America when I found out that wages are relatively the same in nearly every city, and in all states, *despite* the vast differences in cost of living, *then* you look at the cost of living hike and the fact that almost no senior executive has ever *not* made less than they did prior regardless of share price of the company.

Cost of living calculations are really only for employees to get adjusted to. It shocks me how many people *don't* adjust for cost of living when they move even to the next town over. Companies will pay 10 dollars in the midwest, and also 10 dollars in NYC and LA despite those places being upwards of hundreds of percentages higher in cost of living because ""it's unfair for some to make more than others,"" (BS, they make millions or billions), or ""they want everyone to be the same"" (also bs, and objectively false). They've gotten away with paying 99.99% of workers a rate equivalent to someone with zero experience. Because they can. People just accept it. And they acceptit becuase they think other people do (even if they don't/didn't).

*YOU* the applicant should know what *YOU* are worth. THen it's *YOUR* job to demonstrate and ""sell"" that to the employer. A resume is just a business proposal/prospectus.

LA's rampant homeless crisis is due to corporate America paying people only enough to live comfortably in rural Idaho, but they live and work in LA where everything is 20-30%+ more expnesive. *And that's just for daily expenses.*

When you make enough for a modest home in Indiana, that doesn't mean shit when you live in LA and houses *start* out at least twice that, usually more.

The ""most homless are mentally ill"" excuse kind of ignrores the fact that if they were paid fairly to begin with, relative to where they are expected to work (and by extension where they live), people would be far less likely to get sucked into drugs or other vices to cope with the existential dread of impending or actual poverty. It's a cop-out that doesn't get to the root cause; which is: pay people to actually live here (so they can work here) or you won't have any workers.""

Which looks like what we're seeing.

The fact that COVID unemployment *BEAT* most entry-level wage jobs means that those jobs should have been paying *more* than that, minimum, *all along*.

BTW Don't be surprised when corporations buy out entire real estate portfolios from the real estate investors who bought out businesses, apartments, and homes during COVID. They'll turn them into corporate housing so they can take yet another part of owning personal property away from you. Slave pens, with extra steps. Complete with ""security"" (surveilance) cameras because ""we're invested in your safety"" (control).

""You'll own nothing, and you'll be happy""

I'd get up 30-60 minutes before open, have a coffee, and offload the position at open as that's usually when liquidity is flying around. Take it slow as you will likely be highly emotional. The last thing you want to do is make the problem worse with a fat finger or impulsive bid. If you are using a ""good broker"" (i.e., not Robinhood), you might be able to call them before hand and have them help you offload the position. I'd highly recommend that if you are currently realizing you accidentally took on way too much risk.

You took on a shit ton of risk with this position -- be mentally prepared to see a +-20K or more tomorrow. (check out [http://opcalc.com/uP0](http://opcalc.com/uP0) for a breakdown of how it could play out over time) I don't mean to wag the finger, but be careful on large positions like this. You could lose six figures on a position like this in the blink of an eye, so if that's a meaningful amount of money to you, size it wayyyy down. Buying all those calls wouldn't have been any better as you could also get rekt, just with limited downside.

When I was a small child, I had to walk twenty miles in the hot desert to get to school.

And not only would the vultures circle above waiting for me to die from heat exhaustion... the shorts would be there too. 

Following me at a distance. 

All of them. Not just Ken and Citadel and company, but all the short sellers. Including the ones from Glacier Capital.

And one day... they shorted my shoes. Took them right off my feet. Sold them, hoping to cover my feet at a cheaper price. 

Well fast forward, and now I have some fractional GME shares. And I sold a fraction of that fractional share ($20) and bought some sick Walmart shoes, and now I'm back in the desert, back on the journey to finishing the first grade.

So you see this is why I hold.

1935,gyn4fhh,2021-05-19,t3_nfqs26,wallstreetbets,The first narritive is true in some sense. There is defitinely pent up buying pressure from households but the rising prices from commodities and supply chain costs will add fuel to the inflation. I think the shipping lines have already said that they will keep the prices high at least until 2023 and part of the worlds commercial fleet being scrapped in early 2020 from the pandemic a lot new ships needs to be build which in turn adds more pressure to the commodity prices a long with infra projects all over the world. I think the manufactures in asia have already said that they have to raise their prices due the rising prices of commodities and the mining companies are lacking behind in production which affects the price of base metals.

Options were setup and bought for hedging AMC when it hit 20’s where it was shorted down. Would probably require a recall, recount, reverse-split, etc. for it to even get to the 100 that I threw out. Still a great ROI. Just not a short squeeze and I wouldn’t bet on it reaching 100. With GME, then I’m not going to extremes. But, do I believe 5K, 10K, up to 100K is possible. Based on the float and number of outstanding, naked shorted estimates, shorted ETFs, and that the business model with Executive change-up is a big determining factor. This play has been going on for at least 1.5+ years. AMC float is just very big with a lot of share holders. They just had a 17 million block announcement at 14.20.","['GME', 'AMC']",0

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finances\_of\_The\_Church\_of\_Jesus\_Christ\_of\_Latter-day\_Saints  


Axe to grind?  I guess if you have to turn it personal then sure I have an axe to grind.  To you warning people about situation were believers are motivated to give 10% of their money as a requirement for 'exaltation' to this treasure horde thinking it's all going to help the poor or 3rd world nations or church/temples in any significant way is 'an axe'.  To me that's abusive and with my humble knowledge on the matter it's a responsibility to comment when the subject comes up that maybe someone can be saved from that abuse.  


Ask yourself this: Why are the only places to find any sort of details about the LDS Corp's finances contained in sleuthing investigative reporting sites not related to said church?  Why can't we go to the church's website and see a full disclosure of all wealth across all categories?  The church feels it needs to hide the info because it's embarrassing and damaging.  And that should be a huge red flag to believers.  


I don't condemn giving 10% of one's money away, but keep it local.  Local Mormon congregations should be seeing most of the benefit of that 10% and serving their local people's needs.  THAT would be worthy tax free use of donations. Not sending it all to a corporation swimming in so much money it quietly squirrels excess away into various tax free wealth strategies, including the fund mentioned here.

Second of all, while the church's charity arm is tax exempt, its affiliated corporations used for saving and investment purposes do pay taxes. It is my understanding this includes capital gains as well, though I do not see it specifically referenced in the excerpt below, which I'm basing my comment on. I have included the link as well in case you are curious why a church has savings of this size and what does it spend money on. 

In my personal opinion, in this Keynesian era, I believe it's unfortunate more organizations don't have large savings and investments to keep them strong and independent even during downturns.

""The Church and its affiliated entities pay taxes and other governmental levies as required by the laws of each country in which the Church functions. In the United States, where churches and other nonprofit organizations are generally exempt from federal and state income tax, the Church pays taxes on any income it derives from revenue-producing activities that are regularly carried on and are not substantially related to its tax-exempt purposes. Church-affiliated entities that are organized as for-profit corporations pay regular federal and state corporate income taxes on their net income. The Church and its affiliated entities also pay property taxes on property that is not used for religious, educational, or charitable purposes, including taxes on undeveloped land and properties held for investment or commercial purposes. Government fees, levies and assessments are paid in connection with the development of Church property. The Church also pays federal and state employer taxes and withholds and remits employee payroll taxes. Where applicable, the Church and its affiliated entities pay state and local sales and use taxes.""

""HAGENS BERMAN, NATIONAL TRIAL ATTORNEYS, Encourages ContextLogic (WISH) Investors with Significant Losses to Contact Its Attorneys Now, Securities Class Action Pending
GLOBENEWSWIRE - 5:09 PM ET
SAN FRANCISCO, May 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hagens Berman urges ContextLogic Inc. (WISH) investors with significant losses to submit your losses now. A securities class action is pending and certain investors who purchased shares in the company’s December 2020 IPO or on the open market may have valuable claims.

Class Period: Dec. 13, 2020 – May 12, 2021
Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 16, 2021

ContextLogic Inc. (WISH) Securities Class Action:

The complaint alleges that ContextLogic’s IPO registration documents materially overstated the company’s business metrics and financial prospects. Specifically, the IPO registration documents touted ContextLogic’s exponential monthly active user (MAUs) growth, claiming its then108 million MAUs was a key driver of revenue growth.

In reality, by the time of its December 2020 IPO, ContextLogic’s MAUs had declined materially and the IPO registration documents failed to disclose this known trend reasonably likely to materially impact ContextLogic’s profitability.

On Mar. 8, 2021, Context reported disappointing 4Q 2020 and full year 2020 results, disclosing its MAUs had already “declined 10% YoY during Q4 to 104 million.”

Then, on May 12, 2021, ContextLogic (WISH) announced poor Q1 2021 results, including another 7% drop in MAUs to just 101 million, and the company slashed sales guidance for Q2 2021.

These disclosures caused the price of WISH shares to decline sharply.

“We’re focused on investors’ losses and proving ContextLogic (WISH) overstated MAUs and concealed known trends,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

2815,gyn767e,2021-05-19,t1_gylx352,wallstreetbets,"Negative. There is definitely a “gamer” culture in a way that is more distinct than random people who watch a couple shows, vs “tv fans”. The difference here is barrier to entry, i.e. some games cannot be enjoyed or even played by a large slice of the population. 

Consider FromSoftware’s work, or Cuphead, or EVE online. These are not experiences that everyone has access to, because trying to jump into one cold, having never played a game before and without someone to show you the way would be incredibly frustrating. Have you seen a boomer try to play a FPS? It’s astounding. 

Contrast this with TV, where anyone can sit down and watch whatever they like. Far far lower barrier to entry. 

All barriers create a culture, this is inevitable. Doctors, relate to other doctors in a way the rest of us never can. As do soldiers, athletes, bartenders, whoever. They have shared experiences that most other people do not, this creates a culture.

1. If you could hie to Kolob
In the twinkling of an eye,
And then continue onward
With that same speed to fly,
Do you think that you could ever,
Through all eternity,
Find out the generation
Where Gods began to be?

2. Or see the grand beginning,
Where space did not extend?
Or view the last creation,
Where Gods and matter end?
Methinks the Spirit whispers,
“No man has found ‘pure space,’
Nor seen the outside curtains,
Where nothing has a place.”

3. The works of God continue,
And worlds and lives abound;
Improvement and progression
Have one eternal round.
There is no end to matter;
There is no end to space;
There is no end to spirit;
There is no end to race.

4. There is no end to virtue;
There is no end to might;
There is no end to wisdom;
There is no end to light.
There is no end to union;
There is no end to youth;
There is no end to priesthood;
There is no end to truth.

5. There is no end to glory;
There is no end to love;
There is no end to being;
There is no death above.
There is no end to glory;
There is no end to love;
There is no end to being;

Also I figured worst Pandemic in 100 years + pharmacuetical retailer = guaranteed profit. Finding out it was one of Burry's largest positions made it way more interesting. Literally traded flat all year. Even with them crushing earnings it hovered around $72-75. Then I noticed it was trading green on these big red days the last few months. Almost like it was a safe haven for Boomer investors. Once they hired a new rockstar CEO I finally decided to hop on in late February. Got pretty lucky on the 5/21 expirys, but was super confident in the 8/20s. Almost sold all my 5/21's (had six of them) after checking Webull and seeing they only had a 5% chance of expiring itm.

4378,gynbov1,2021-05-19,t3_nfqs26,wallstreetbets,"Paying back a loan destroys money. Because the governments have funded through debt, or deficit spending, the debt needs to be serviced. Servicing a debt destroys money. Deficit spending pulls demand forward for current consumption at the cost of future consumption. Inflation will be transitory as the current consumption spiked considerably. Its how long it can stay transitory that is in question right now. Transitory could mean another 12months from now. Its absurd to think there isnt inflation right now. But how long it lasts is unclear. Theres a saying that you cant be a ‘little bit’ pregnant. One would argue that once inflation is here you cant put it back in the bottle.

The fiscal policy is what has changed from the GFC. Wage subsidies and unemployment and all the help for businesses was effectively helicopter drops of money. A lot of it doesnt need to be paid back, some of it is taxed, some of it not, all depends on the country/state/province etc. I myself cant say for sure but time will tell if the fiscal policy is enough to drive a sustained inflation year over year. 

Between debt and fiscal policy, im not sure which force will win. But lets just be clear, the fed is not ‘printing’ money, its deficit spending. Deficit spending is inflationary AT FIRST. QE is not money printing, its not inflationary.

More to the point though, “gamer” culture is worthless if the only thing that sets it apart from the average person’s engagement with video games is the difficulty of the game.

They’re basically different hobbies. Like Chess and Settlers of Catan. Or YA Lit and Classics.

Really, when gaming culture was at its peak, it was held together by relatively simple games with low barriers to access. References as banal as “your princess is in another castle” or “the cake is a lie” were used as shorthand for the shared experiences of gamers. There’s still games like that now, but everyone and their mother is playing Minecraft, Animal Crossing or Among Us, so that’s not really “gamer” turf anymore.

You'd be cementing permanence and untold optionality. If there are buyers, sell that #TeslaSouffle,” Burry tweeted Tuesday night. December 1,Tuesday is when he tweeted and high price that day was 582ish..My point is even Burry didn’t initiate short at top price it was at same levels as of today he probably would have averaged more at 800ish levels to bring his average down and that would have ballooned his put holdings but you also need to account for 5-6 months theta decay..

They're going to keep focusing on our defense side which is the only thing keeping us going financially since Russia and the Saudis decided to run a train on crude oil.

6498,gyngkxu,2021-05-19,t1_gymp74y,wallstreetbets,"Netflix would need to provide some level of comparable service, e-commerce and online retail would take over the market before netflix does. I have no doubt netflix is looking to expand, but unless they plan on reinvesting their entire focus, no way do they have the fundamentals to fill that gap. There are endless numbers of companies that would eat up that market before netflix does. They simply do not have the infrastructure to expand that quickly into a market that they have no prior or obvious interest in. If netflix truly thinks that they can replace these markets, they're morons. Not saying your wrong, but this would be incredibly stupid of them and not very probable. More than likely, both AMC and Gamestop are doing more good for their market by facilitating totaly different business models that can only be seen as expansive to the total pool. In short, the media/gaming market overlaps a ton and act more as layers contributing to the total interest of the market. This type of thing has been theorized ever since netflix/steam type services have come into existence. Guess what. The market for physical retail and theatres have proved the test of time and the new horizons for these markets look better than ever. If you like movies, you probably have netflix and go to theatres. if you like games, you probably have physical and digital copies. If Netflix showed signs of truly coming in to provide for these  markets, or worked with companies that CAN facilitate Gamestop + Amc's market, I would say this might be more believable. But to think that bankrupting Amc or Gamestop would convert into more Netflix Subs is braindead. Even with expansion of Netflix, I don't believe they have any plans to capitalize on Gamestop or Amc's market because they can't do what Amc or Gamestop Does. Let's think logically. If you go to the theatre OR go shop Gamestop, you more than likely have a Hulu, HbO max, or netflix subscription. The overlap would be insane. If anything Netflix would be competing for market share within their OWN streaming industry. Makes no sense IMO",['AMC'],0

Im not certain that inflation is transitory, just the nature of deficit spending is transitory. Think about you getting a loan to buy a house. You are instantly granted 500k and buy a house with it. Now you pay it back slowly over time, plus interest. The interest stays in the system, the principal is effectively destroyed. You pulled demand forward to buy the house today, at the expense of putting a portion of income aside each month to pay it off; money that could have otherwise been used on other purchases.

We still are paying back debt from ww2. 

In terms of QE being inflationary, its been happening since the early 2000s in Japan, then the US, UK, EU, and now almost everyone and inflation didnt occur with those cases. You need to look at bank lending data, new loans created. Highly recommend you read everything you can about QE, its an interesting banking policy.",[],0

I mean look at Jake Paul. Assume he said what will happen. If I'm caught driving a golf cart on a protected turtle habitat. Well 1, you could kill or disrupt the baby turtles. 2. Society will judge you. 3. There may be legal effects.

In your case I dismissed the dildo patrol part of your question and answered the more reality based part of what you were proposing. You can make your decision based on the reasons why, or you can make it based on the law. Most people don't need the law to keep them in line. Most rules are generally there because they codify decent behavior which, upon inspection, is obvious and apparent for other reasons. You can make your decision based on the underlying reason for the rule rather than the enforcement of the rule. Now, if the underlying reason is bullshit then it might take enforcement to make you comply. In this case I don't think that's necessary for anyone with half a brain, and truly most of the world have figured this out. Someone who is not vaccinated and refuses to wear a mask in the midst of a global pandemic is really in the minority, globally, when it comes to that behavior choice.

That said, it's been 16 months, you know by now they probably won't do anything. A private business may ask you to leave. A public building will follow whatever the current codes say and they vary by region. Your personal risk is low. The risk that you catch it, don't know it, and spread it is higher if you don't wear a mask and don't get vaccinated. We've literally seen this happen around the world for the past year and half. It's not theoretical and it's not controversial. Choosing to take that risk knowing it affects others is a choice that doesn't need enforcement to help you decide what to do.",[],0

In regards to comment ""Shady"" are you referring to an individual who No longer has any say, on day to day decisions?

or

Are you referring to every hard working individual globally, who has worked on and with Nikola Motors as a whole, helping this company succeed.


Penalizing a company for someone elses personal choices is a mistake and wrong.

An example to your comment a family member  has committed a shady act and the whole town has declared you and your entire family as shady and not to be trusted, because of one family members.
You and your family are kind, wholesome, good people. Why should you be Penalized for a family members shady choices.

At the same time, the OGs are leaving en masse, because they don't want to read ""GME to the moon🚀🚀🚀"" 5,000 times a day. There's like 8 new replacement WSB for OGs now, and the community is fractured at best.

At the same time, bots are running rampant on WSB. Believe what you want to believe about GME, but this is just an indisputable fact to anyone who spends more than 5 minutes in the discussion thread. Way too many weird bot-spam posts, and certain comments getting way more upvotes/downvotes than would ever make sense organically.

So the conspiracy theory is this: big money (aka hedgies) were getting worried by WSB, which was growing immensely in both number and significance, so they manufactured all this GME/AMC stuff to basically kill WSB.

Because, regardless of how you feel about any of this, I've been on WSB for years. While it was always stupid, You could actually follow trends and get good DD back in the day. Now? You can't learn a damn thing here with all the noise, and the DD is worse than trash.

Oh really? Let me help you:

""The marriage of legal children, in fact, has been relatively common   
throughout U.S. history. The U.S. Census Bureau did not link age with   
marital status till 1880, which makes national figures unavailable   
before that time. But in that year 11.7 percent of   
fifteen-to-nineteen-year-old girls were wives (the census did not   
specify exact age and marital status till 1910). That number dipped in   
1890 and then increased incrementally through the 1920s to 12.6 percent   
in 1930. Youthful marriage decreased, as did the overall marriage rate,   
during the Great Depression. It then rose again dramatically after World  
 War II but has been declining since the early 1960s. ""

In more modern times, the entire organization is controlled by 15 elderly white men, as women are forbidden in positions of authority within the church. Women also need to have 7 children before they are granted an automatic pass into heaven, any less and their husband gets to decide if she gets to enter heaven. Any lgbt inclinations are punishable with excommunication, and while the LDS church has a net worth of over 100 billion dollars, homelessness in their capital city of salt lake has one of the countries highest homeless populations.

1. IDGAF whether my burger is made out of real meat or not so long as it tastes good, so I'm totally down with eating a Beyond Burger or equivalent, **IF AND ONLY IF**

2. It is cheaper than a regular meat burger. Look I'm not eating cheeseburgers on the regular because I'm trying to spend a ton of money on food, and forgoing straws at restaurants and not eating threatened fish (primarily because they're expensive) is about as far as my concern for the environment at meal time goes.  If money was no object I'd be eating at a decent restaurant for lunch and getting a well rounded meal.  
Right now all of the meat alternative burgers are priced like their target market is the people who shop at whole foods and trader joes.

The prices might go down over time, but that's assuming they have room to go down, right now I'm not clear on whether the prices are high because the cost of production is high (in which case the question is can the cost be reduced) or if they are just scalping all the Trader Joe's crowd early adopters before other companies crowd the market.

**TL;DR - Average people aren't going to move away from their habits until you give them a cheaper alternative, they don't give a shit about saving the environment if its not personally beneficial to them, they have more pressing daily concerns. The for less wealthy and educated populations, that goes doubly. So in this particular case, I don't see an near-term case for corn prices to decrease. Long term, maybe, depends on supply and demand for food in general, which it will most certainly still be used as. Climate change will definitely have an impact on food supplies.**

Rant: Keep in mind this is the same population that makes even my best attempts at recycling properly mostly fucking pointless because half of them throw shit that's obviously not recyclable curbside in the recycling bins (air filters, scrap WOOD, food containers still full of food, etc)  and the other half don't even bother recycling anything.

GME has a capital-structure adjusted beta of -21.6, which is INSANE. This means that GME is RADICALLY inversely correlated to movements in SPY (companies typically have betas of -1 to 1...).",['GME'],0

Yes, he “married” a ton of women. By marriage we mean either civil marriages or what we call sealings, which are purely spiritual, so the “all eternity” deal. We don’t know how many of those marriages were simply for eternity or were marriages in the typical sense, but the youngest of them, the one you’re referencing, was only for eternity. 

Polygamy wasn’t a founding idea of the church, but introduced a bit after to the apprehension of Joseph and most of the church, which is why it was introduced slowly over time and more often than not in secret. People knew yes, but only a select trusted few at the initial introduction of the doctrine was able to practice it. 

Idk where you got the married off and rape part, bc reports from government officials who went to Utah made mention of how close and positive the culture was in Utah. Funny enough, it was one of the first communities that gave women a higher role in many aspects, one of which being consent. Women weren’t forced into polygamous relationships, and had all the right to leave if they wanted to. 

We can consume media, idk where you got the idea of tv or newspapers. 

As for African Americans and punishable with death? What even is that? I can guarantee you nobody has ever believed that en masse, and if they did, it’s a false doctrine or a screwed up culture thing that people don’t agree with nowadays. 

Women have positions of authority, search up Relief society and Sunday School general presidencies as well as read the Family Proclamation to the world, in which women are equal partners in relationships and all other aspects of life. 

Idk why the church being run by 15 men? So what if they’re white? They’re chosen by God through revelation. There’s plenty of people who aren’t white that hold leadership positions in the church, two of them being  Ulisses Suares and Gerrit Gong. 

We don’t need to have 7 children, legit have never heard of that in my life. False doctrine. 

LGBT inclinations are fine, but acting upon them isn’t fine. Just like how acting on lust before marriage in a straight relationship is also potential for excommunication. Not to mention that marriage is ordained between a man and a woman before God, that’s not even a church thing, it’s a Doctrinal thing that’s lasted centuries. 

The church has plenty of resources to help the homeless, not sure on what exactly they’re doing to combat it but they don’t just sit idly by and do nothing. Not to mention it’s not the churches job to fix every problem in the world. The church is simply a church, and can’t do everything. Not to mention that a lot of it is funds for a rainy day. The church teaches self reliance, so it makes sense a big organization such as itself would have funds for that. 

Pretty sure the aid thing is fake news, i certainly don’t receive any more benefits than normal.

We also don’t practice polygamy either, some other break offs of the original faith do but not the main group.

I cleared out my 401k and threw it into ripple. The sentiment was back then that then you parents asked about crypto you knew it was the top. It got way too main stream in Nov. of that year and I sold in December close to the top; it crashed in January. My idealogy with crypto has always been that it’s ahead of its time; the world isn’t ready for a decentralized currency and I don’t think crypto is ready to be main stream yet. It will take some great catalyst and an economic shakeup unseen of in order for it to finally become what it’s destined to be.

Also this was not a short bull run at all. BiTCh was 5k March of last year and saw 12x growth in little over 12 months. EsTHer was 121 at the same time and look where it is now. You can’t have that level of growth constantly without a massive pullback. Zoom out to a 5 year chart and just look at what has happened in a short amount of time.

It’s intentionally not designed to be comparable to other inflation statistics, but it does shed some light on the accuracy of the government’s claim that their inflation statistics represent changes to real prices.
