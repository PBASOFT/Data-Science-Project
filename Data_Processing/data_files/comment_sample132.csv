The rest of the sentence and quote are here:

""During the nine months ended March 31, 2021, the Company incurred $31,837,067 of operating expenses compared to $4,493,703 of operating expenses during the nine months ended March 31, 2020. Overall, the increase in operating expense was due to the fact that the Company issued 33,650,036 common shares and 200,000 Series A preferred shares for consulting services with a fair value of $27,072,162""

“during the nine months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the issuance of 26,446,200 common shares with a fair value of $1,613,468 for consulting services during the nine months ended March 31, 2020. Of the remaining operating expenses not related to share-based compensation of $4,764,905, the expenditures were higher than the prior period amount of $2,880,235 due to an increase in general and administrative expense as the overall level of day-to-day operating costs increased including increases in payroll and benefits expense as the Company required more staffing compared to prior year.”


It looks like they issued 6MM more shares than the same period a year ago.  They used $4.7MM as share based compensation. 

The share price went from $0.07 to somewhere over $2 in that period.

 $HROW                             27 mil share float. They make compounded eye drops and eye injections for eye surgery  . 
They save the healthcare system 100s of millions . 
They price their eye injections for 20 dollars or so. Very cheap
They save the patients the requirement of taking multiple eye drops costing 1,000s and the inconvenience of taking it multiple times per day.

They have over 5 spin-off companies which they own 20-40 percent stake in. One is eton trading in the nasdaq.

Each of these companies has pipeline fda products . Eton already has gotten a couple of  fda  approvals in less then one year . They have approvals coming up May 27 May 29 and June 18 


Revenue  consistent increasing 30 percent year over year . Right now their annual revenue is about 60 million with 40 percent margins . They are on track to 100 million in 2022. 

They are going for fda approvals now on some of their eye products such as their compounded eye drops and eye injections . Which already have a proof of concept with over ten thousand procedures . If they get one fda approval , the price of the product will be multiplied by ten times at least . I can see Their revenue multiply ten times over. 

The market cap on this stock is 250 million . 
I mean they have 50 million dollars sitting  in stock in just one of their spinoff company iPos. They have 20 million cash for their fda approval pipeline.

One of their other spinoff companies is mko melt. First oral anesthesia for office procedures like eye surgeries or dental surgeries etc. it’s ok the market now as compounded drug .

Another spinoff company surface has a superior product for dry eye. Data shows it’s 20 percent more effective compared to leading dry eye formulas . Like restasis or xiidra. Restasis has a billion dollars in sales annually and will be going off parent in the next few years. Surface will be phase three ready in 6 months. Harrow owns 40 percent of this company. Surface will also go public in 6 months . 

Hrow should be trading now at 25 dollars. 

Market cap is low, revenue and margins are profitable , and the reason they are not trading that high is becuaee the market does not like non fda approved drugs . 
However this will change as hrow begins going the fda approval route . 
It has a lot of assets. It’s profitable .",[],0

""A panel of Richmond officials has selected Urban One's casino project in South Richmond, concluding a months-long evaluation of various casino development plans the city requested.  
While Richmond voters will decide whether to permit the project in a referendum on Nov. 2, pending City Council approval, the evaluation panel's decision means that the city is no longer considering plans for a casino on Arthur Ashe Boulevard where the Bowtie movie theater currently stands.  
Administration officials in a release said Mayor Levar Stoney will introduce plans to the City Council on Monday to partner with Urban One, a Washington-based media conglomerate, to build a casino on property currently owned by Philip Morris USA near the intersection of Commerce Road and Walmsley Boulevard.  
“The project will create over 1,000 good paying jobs, generate a significant amount of new revenue for the city, and establish an additional economic engine in South Richmond,"" Stoney said.  
The release says the evaluation panel recommended the Urban One project based on the project' ""feasibility and sustainability, proposed location, economic development impact, financial revenue impact, and community benefits.""  
Urban One's projections predict the casino project will generate $525 million in new tax revenue and other benefits for the city over the next decade. The company also says it is committed to a $15 minimum wage for its employees, who is says will make an average of $55,000 annually....""",[],1

I realize OTC doesn't have to report, but a company like Humbl who say they want to be BIGGER then Paypal would most likely file 8ks like MANY companies even in the OTC/ penny stock world jus to show they cross their T's and dot their I's.

The MOST interesting is going to be the reaction from George Sharpe.  He seems like a guy who doesn't mind mind being aggressive with folks based on him snapping at SANP CEO.  If he responds with legal action then the report has some issues.  If he doesn't sue then there is likely  merit to the report.

GTx's pipeline was rife with failed clinical trials after the other. Look at each major drop in the chart and you will realize that they were a result of poor results not dilution. If you just look at their pipeline, they focused on SARMS, SERMS, and enobosarm, vastly different from ONCT's. GTx's management also did a very poor job and there are a bunch of other things that weren't going well for the company. 

Obviously dilution affects ONCT's stock price and in the two times they announced a bought offering, it went down by $1-2. As a result of that, they are well poised to fund their trials until 2023 and currently have no doubt in their balance sheet.",[],0

974,gywlb05,2021-05-21,t3_nhixfs,pennystocks,"After watching UONE, UONEK, BYFC, and LMFA today, I'm definitely looking at AMS and PSRU.  People seem to be anticipating that a lot of news will be coming from these companies around Juneteenth again this year, and some of the company share prices have started to lift off already in anticipation of good PRs.  That includes PRs from outside companies pledging financial support of black-owned businesses.  I'm also looking at RLJ (not a penny) for the same reason. 

There are some predictable and cyclical patterns in stocks (like Amazon's share price always going up right after they release their Holiday sales numbers).  It seems like the companies listed above seem to release good PR in June (with a corresponding rise in share price).  UONE went from $2 to $36 last year, and then it settled at $6.  (So, someone starting at $2 ended at $6 if they never sold.  Not bad.)  UONE share price was $6 earlier this week, and is now over $9.",[],0
