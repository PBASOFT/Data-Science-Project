This is a huge Shopping Center Company. Was at 90 EUR \~ 109,72 USD per share when Shorters and manipulaters started to fuck us. Net Asset Value per share is somewhere around 40 EUR, 0,5 EUR Dividend, used to be 2,5 EUR and more in the passed years. Somehow the price is always going down, now at 15 EUR = 18,29 USD (!), although its value is much higher and nobody is really selling shares. They have always been setting an ""ex-dividend"", but never used to price the earnings in again (for decades !!!!) although the company is earning good money and everybody is holding and buying (hereby meaning private investors). Shorters are not able to buy back the outstanding shares anymore but somehow the stock is not rising..

Actual example: I'll make an agreement with Tom to pay him $10 for the right to buy his 100 Snicker's bars at a price of 2$ per Snickers bar. This agreement will expire June 1st. That's the call. 

Right now, his Snickers bar is worth 1$. If June 1st comes around and his Snickers bars are worth $1.50 on the market, the call is worthless because anybody, including me, can go buy Snickers from the market for cheaper than the agreement I had with Tom. I just paid $10 to make this contract that turned out to be useless. I lost $10.

IF it's June 1st and Snickers are now worth $3 per bar, I will exercise my contract with Tom and pay him $2x100 = $200. I now have 100 Snickers bars that are worth $3 each or $300 total. Subtract the $10 I paid for the contract and you have a profit of $90 if you sell your 100 Snickers on the market immediately after exercising my contract.

Everyone spent the last year either house bound, or out trying to make ends meet. All our casual fun was put on hold.

AMC is the most well known movie theatre in the world. The world is largely open again (at least in US and Europe...sorry, friends in India, South America, etc). People will want to go out again, and even with spaced seating for the near future, I predict this to be the ""Summer of AMC"".

On the other side, HBO still has some movies contracted to be released via streaming, which could prove to be a decent buck towards the fall/winter season (going shopping and then home to catch the latest movie on your home theatre), but i personally dont know if Studios will continue the direct to streaming option.

I own some small stock in AMC, instead of going Crypto (thank gods, because i dont see that lasting too much longer then a few more years, if that. Countries are starting to tax it, so there goes the ""unregulated"" part. Bye-bye, Crypto Craze), and im doing decent with it...dbled my investment at the least, headed into triple.

What really matters is that you vote at all.  Voting allows you to be counted as a shareholder.

  
On June 2nd, all shareholders will be sent a packet in their mail/email for a shareholder vote that takes place on June 29th.  


  If rumors are true, sometime during this window or shortly after, Adam Aron will publicly reveal that he has legal proof his company is being illegally attacked and has suffered measurable damages.

5535,gzpa3iz,2021-05-28,t3_nml5zo,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no. I'll explain best I can using a real world example. Porsche and Volkswagen got into a fight and owned most of the shared forcing a squeeze. It only stopped because they came to an agreement and settled. Theoretically that squeeze could have been infiitinite. 

What we have here is the same thing. Except it millions of people with the goal of triggering a 73 trillion dollar insurance plan. So theoretically it can hit 100k a share or more because the money is there.

The only time it may not happen is what brings about the biggest difference between Volkswagen and now. Volkswagen was two companies buying all the shares and not selling because they wanted a hostile takeover essentially. 

In this case it's millions of people instead of 2 people(companies). So the chances of it happening are slimmer because you need millions of people to not sell. 

So, in theory it's possible. However, we do not know the true intentions of everyone here. I would think the best bet is to hold and see how high it goes and then sell on the way down. And I would guess, because most people can't read the numbers properly or the graphs, and hopefully you picked the right high to sell down from and not just a dip from a short ladder attack or a smaller group of paper hands. 

Personally, I'm holding til the moon. I'd love to see 5-6 figures. While at the same time I'm ok with being wrong and selling at the lowest point of the squeeze cuz I make profit anyway and the hedgies get fucked.",[],1

Honest answer, I'm jumping in a little clueless on this one. Most of my money is in GME but since AMC is bubbling up, I figure I'll ride it for a bit, take profits (hopefully a LOT of them) and roll that into more GME.

The only DD I really know of is there are claims that AMC & GME are both shorted by an overlapping group of people. So if that group gets margin called on either bet, the other one will also moon.

I will say this, the most ambitious price projections I've seen by traders (not just Apes) is AMC peaks @$1.6M & GME peaks @$19M. I have no clue if that will happen, but I'm here to enjoy the ride!","['GME', 'AMC']",0

If i bought a call option with $25 strike, i make money if the stock price is significantly higher than that cuz the option lets me buy a stock at $25 even though its being traded at lets say $28. Then the Market Makers get scared cuz they are obliged to deliver us those shares, and they need to buy the stocks as quickly as possible before stock price goes up even higher, and will be more costly to the Market Makers.

Let me explain how insane that is.

AMC has a market cap of almost $12billion dollars

With 450 million shares 

12 billion market cap divided by 450 million shares gets you your share price of $26


You need an extra $11,000,000,000 (billion) dollars invested to reach a price of $51 

You need  $225,000,000,000,000 (trillion) to reach a price of $500k per share.

5920,gzpaw8q,2021-05-28,t1_gzpaaf9,wallstreetbets,But basically how it works is that a call option is you buying a contract that gives you the right to buy 100 shares of a particular stock at a particular price. Options can make or lose you so much money because even a small fluctuation in stock price greatly increases or decreases the value of the contract. There are other factors that come into play too such as how much time until the contract expires and other shit that I don't really understand so just look up some YouTube videos. [These might help.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0J8drGAJS4&list=PLOweupE79XXiBaeH_xBpkUcYUsrAaKQen) but the best thing to do is just start buying some options and losing money and then you'll be inspired to figure it out really fucking fast.,[],0

Yeah, i actually do feel pretty good with Nok since its a large 90k person company, in business since 1800s, PE trading well below average market PE... and their 5G pivot puts them into 8 trillion dollar market by 2030. My entry point was like 3.80  so i am green quite a bit.. and i think this will run alot longer  since the 5G pivot is many times NOK market cap even with only a small portion of the market.

Id welcome some volatility.. this stock is trapped in the option chain from MMs selling massive calls on it..volatility woukd explode my LEAPs

The premium is the amount you pay for the option contract. Each contract is equal to 100 shares of stock.  

It‚Äôs called an option because it gives you the right but not the obligation to buy the stock.  You can exercise the option which means buy the stock at the price you picked + the premium or sell the option and not buy anything and just take profit.

don't do anything, let them be called away. it's too late now.

even if you roll, you won't be able to sell your shares for this extra gain.

if the price goes back to 10, you missed out on the gain to 19 as well.

the best case scenario is that you roll and someone actually exercises the option early, but I don't think that's likely. people usually sell to close the option for a profit rather than exercise, especially if there will be a squeeze. exercising the option during a squeeze will require a lot of money. it's much simpler to sell the call to someone else.",[],1

But we can run with the AMC example: AMC is at 26.51 at the writing of the comment, and a call option expiring June 4th @ 15$ is currently sitting at 12.05 per 1 share, BUT typically options are sold together for 100 shares, so buying 1 option contract would cost 1205 (12.05*100). Now your break even point would be sitting at 27.05 (15 strike price+12.05 premium)... the moment you‚Äôre above 27.06 you are making a profit. But you‚Äôre right in partially where you could exercise at 27.06 and make profit ((27.06-27.05)*100) to arrive at whatever your profit would be.

I‚Äôm using arbitrary numbers so also a rule of calls (which makes them particularly attractive to some) because your profit is virtually unlimited because the price of a stock could be infinite (theoretically).

I hope that makes more sense! Feel free to PM me if you need anymore explanation; sometimes there could be an ELI5 for finance but def do your own research because the stock market is inherently risky and options have a significantly higher level of risk! Be safe and do the DD!",['AMC'],1

It‚Äôs been sitting at 16% to 19% since then, which means it‚Äôs just other smaller day traders/investors shorting. Even companies doing really well have 20-30% shorts so I see nothing out of the ordinary.

This sub is and always was for those people who are making crazy bets that can make alot of money or lose it all. Those that lost it all would post it as loss porn for all to celebrate. And those that made great gains would show off their successful bets...hence the word bets in the name of the sub.

Everyone starts off not knowing the complexities of the market and even those that are experienced don't fully understand all the complexities which is perfectly fine.

What you seem to not understand is that this particular sub is not for people who are just starting out. There are plenty of subs like r/stocks or r/investing for people who are new and don't understand the simple basics like options trading strategies, credit spreads, derivatives, market caps, simple KPIs, and FDs.

Its also not a sub dedicated to a few stocks being spammed over and over again nor some moral fight against the big bad guys...... It's gamblers sub for all kinds of crazy bets.

You're trying to sound smart but you're an immature moron. 

That doesn't mean I want you to lose money or I'd be upset if you are making big gains. I hope everyone makes money. I gauge my success not on how others are doing but against my own internal goals....

if you're new to investing, your smartest investment is index funds for steady long term gains that build wealth. 95% of what I'm in right now is FLCNX in my 401(k) or VUG (vanguard growth ETF) for individual. Even experienced traders have difficulty beating index funds. Seeing massive gains in here can be misleading because of survivorship bias: they often (with exceptions) also have massive losses from high risk trading strategies like buying options that can average out to a loss. Focus first on investing in the overall market to study patterns in it and help you become a better investor.
