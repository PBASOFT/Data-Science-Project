34,gyyz1md,2021-05-21,t3_nho5kv,StockMarket,"First You have a broad U.S. index plus a growth portfolio plus a dividend portfolio plus the Nasdaq.  This makes the growth and/or dividend somewhat redundant.   It the idea is to slightly undervalue non-dividend value stocks, I guess that‚Äôs one way.  Otherwise, ditch both growth and value if you intend to have broad exposure. 

Second, you do not need a FTSE 100 index fund plus a Broad FTSE fund.  That is overweighting large cap when the indexes already are mostly large cap and the funds even overweight large cap even more than the indexes they track. So the mega cap and large cap funds are both dominated by the same stocks.  

Third, you should not have so much invested in UK stocks, even if you live in the UK.  I live in the U.S and I intend to retire here or in no particular country and even I limit my exposure to the U.S. to about 60% which is a very broad stock market and makes up a huge part of all public stocks by market cap (and number) worldwide.  I would put half of that money into a broad international index fund, preferably one with some small-cap exposure.

To deal with these first three redundancies/over complications, I‚Äôd look at an all cap world stock index fund or etf, (like VT/ vanguard all-cal world index etf) instead of having all of these.  Then I‚Äôd supplement that with emerging markets; small cap international (ex us), small cap emerging market, and small cap U. S. funds to overweight emerging markets and small cap slightly.  These all-cap funds and international funds actually only have a bit of emerging market or small cap exposure (less than the indexes they track, which in and of themselves only have 15-25% mid-small cap or emerging market stocks, and only 5-10 percent small cap (and even then small cap parts are dominated by the biggest cap stocks.  You may even consider adding micro cap funds.

Fourth, that much in Etherium, bitcoin, and staking funds seems excessive.  I‚Äôd cut each down to 5% or have 5% in but coin and 5% in the largest 2-19 alt coins by market cap.  But you could go as high as having 5% in 4-20 coins, including bitcoin, and the next 3-19 biggest.   In general, you should maintain a 5% rule-no more than 5% in any one security/crypto.  I would staking funds like a single security. You have 3 in that case that break the 5% rule.",[],1

I made more doing nothing yesterday than I did all week at work.  Thats why I love crypto. It doesnt matter if it has flaws etc because people love it and our buying it and have been for years.

AMC was selling shares to raise money every time their stock got stupid high (14+) because they are getting the most bang for their buck that they can imagine they will get.  The shares they sold put downward pressure on the stock price, causing it to move lower.  AMC stopped selling once the price of its shares got stupid low (like 10, or whatever), and waited until the stock got stupid high again before selling more.

This theory does not require a conspiracy in order for it to be correct, therefore, it probably is correct.

Also, the part about AMC trying to sue, arguing their FMV is the price at the top of a short squeeze seems like a bit of a stretch.

Myself having a business degree and not a law degree... I would say that there is no way for AMC to successfully argue their stock has some FMV that is far higher than what they have been averaging for a long time frame and that they therefore lost some huge figure worth of money they could potentially have had.

Why wouldn't the counterparty to the suit just make the argument that if AMC wanted post squeeze prices on its shares, then AMC could have just sold AFTER the squeeze?  That was something that AMC could have done to mitigate its own loss.   
 That's imminently doable AND it takes the fault away from whoever is doing the shorting.

Again, I don't have a law degree, but if someone isn't mitigating their own loss, then I don't think they have a solid claim.  TMK, damages should be awarded based on damages that AMC tried to mitigate above that which they were actually able to mitigate.  Without AMC trying to mitigate their own loss, the counterparty should be able to successfully argue that there should be no award of any kind to AMC.",['AMC'],0

489,gz14ex0,2021-05-22,t3_ni1z8t,StockMarket," Just a question, and I am by no means a financial expert, but is this just a brokerage account? If yes, then consider also investing in a Roth IRA for the tax benefits. Maxing out contributions every year is the best way to go, but literally anything starting at age 19 is better than nothing or waiting even 10 years. You can go the managed/automated route; I prefer the self-directed route so that I can make all those decisions myself. 

A lot of people don‚Äôt like to diversify, or just stick to one or two index funds. I personally believe in diversifying, and my Roth includes several REITs, and ETFs covering multiple sectors, including biotech, green energy, healthcare, etc. You‚Äôre young, so don‚Äôt be afraid to take some risks, especially in emerging markets and emerging sectors, because you have time to ride out the ups and downs and realize solid gains as these markets/sectors grow in the future. Also don‚Äôt be afraid to diversify between small, mid, and large cap, and remember that any good portfolio will include some bonds for stability. 

My rule of thumb is to put anything that pays dividends into my Roth because your dividends and gains aren‚Äôt taxed upon disbursement. You‚Äôve already paid taxes on the money going in, so everything grows tax free and is disbursed tax free. 

All of that might seem boring to a lot of people, but you‚Äôll thank yourself in 40 years, even if you go the easy managed Roth route. 

My brokerage account is for fun, but still fairly diversified to (hopefully) my advantage. My Roth is for serious, planned investments to generate the most income possible to supplement my pension when I retire. That day may seem like a long ways off, but you‚Äôll get there so much more quickly than you might think! But take all advice, even everything I just wrote, with a grain of salt.

I don't know which of those assets will be good for the future, therefore each is worth the same to me. What good will a 5% gold position do you in the long term? Even if stocks really crater, like 40 % loss, your stake in gold is too small to counter that.
Another asset class potentially interesting to hedge against downturns are EM bonds in hard currencys like EUR or USD. The prices of those etf are pretty much flatlines but have ~4 % annual dividends. I'm still unsure if gold and crypto are hedging enough or if the bonds should be included.
I wouldn't hold a cash position but then again I'm not investing straight away but have some formulas to get the dips. Therefore I have ~10% cash sitting around regardless.",[],1

672,gz2l2eb,2021-05-22,t3_niiacg,StockMarket,"In a general sense, the cost of higher wages will resolve into higher consumer prices. There's probably a leveling off period until the costs adjustments settle down. It is possible that the revenue would drop temporarily for a short period, but long-term it should not have a negative effect on the value of a company. 

If anything, by itself it should have a long-term positive effect. The business is playing with a bit more money, it has a bit happier and more steady employees, and operating in a bit more expensive space.

It's important to always see business decisions through the obvious lens of: businesses are trying to compete at all times. Nobody is going to pay higher wages if they don't have to. This means that the extra cost of labor is not a gift, it's the cost of doing business in the market, which means it affects all other companies the same, and it cascades across the market naturally. 

This is why the main result of higher wages is higher consumer costs. And why that's fine to consumers as well, because it's the market driving the cost. None of these increases are artificial, the company is trying to avoid raising wages as it is.

However, the higher cost of wage could compound with other issues to create stagnation. If higher wages means higher consumer costs, at the same time that we are struggling with inflation because of other reasons, it could mean a temporary lower purchasing power for consumers, which would result in markets going colder.

That part should be taken into account because these elements are not happening in a vacuum. The reason workers are demanding higher wages are connected to the reasons inflation is going up and there's market instability, it's all connected to the aftermath of the pandemic.

The guideline is entirely straightforward and especially very much clarified in the article distributed in Les √âchos Bitcoin and cryptographic forms of money, new computerized coins: ""Take a data set. Permit anybody to make changes to this data set, on condition that you proclaim yourself a ""part"". Set up an extremely long and complex control methodology which should be completed each time a specific number (""block"") of changes is mentioned. This method is completed not by a solitary regulator, but rather by all the intentional ""individuals"". Once approved, the ""block"" of changes is dated and added to the others in the vault. At long last, permit everybody to peruse the vault, and you have a blockchain data set "".

No requirement for a notarial act or common status register or even cadastre with this appropriated register innovation which assists with making information safer and straightforward. Blockchain innovation is after each of the innovations whose information base can't be changed without meeting certain conditions. Standard example, imagine that Peter gives 3 Bitcoins to Paul. The exchange will be immediately broadcast on the distributed network, made up of computers called nodes. However, it is only after a certain period of time that the exchange will be confirmed by the computers belonging to the networks using the algorithms specific to said Blockchain. Once validated, the exchange now forms a new data coalition for the registry. It is added to others in the existing Blockchain, permanently and immutable.  
Behind these network computers, it is minors who validate the exchanges. To confirm an exchange, a miner must find the product of a cryptographic function that connects the new alliance to its predecessor. This is called the proof of struggle.

875,gz3dd99,2021-05-22,t1_gz389cy,StockMarket,">Higher wages doesn‚Äôt equal more purchasing power right?

Well, it does for the workers that earn the higher wage. It makes a massive difference to those at the entry wage levels to make $12/hr or $17 /hr. Life changing difference.

For the rest of the market, it doesn't mean much once the price corrections settle down.

So, in the short term, those at the bottom of wages will see their purchasing power increased (due to wage increase), everyone else sees their purchasing power decreased by a tiny amount. 

Over time, natural corrections iron out the difference. The market gets used to the small price increases, those earning lower wages get used to a higher standard of living, those that were earning higher wages and saw their purchasing power devalued will settle their position via natural competition (get a raise, or learn to live a tiny bit smaller, etc). 

And we all settle into a future in which the business is not the one left carrying the difference in value. It all gets passed onto the market naturally, making the impact on business fairly neutral past the short term.

&#x200B;

\> there is an equilibrium point between wages and consumer prices that we‚Äôll always revert to.

Yes, because in the end it's all rooted in natural competition. As long as the market is more or less allowed to compete in fair terms, balance is found on its own.

Let's have fun with a simple example:

Restaurants are coming back from the pandemic and finding out that workers no longer want to work for the low wages pre-pandemic. In order to compete, restaurants are going to have to offer \~$17/hr to attract workers. This might seem high, but restaurants will do it because the demand is there and they need the workers in order to do business. They might go into this hiring timidly, but will continue the practice as long as it continues to be profitable. People that want to dine at restaurants will see slightly higher food bills, and will decide if they are fine with that or if they want to dine out a bit less often.

This goes on for months, eventually we settle on a balance of employment and consumer demand. Whatever the food prices end up being, however many new workers must be hired at $17/hr to meed that demand. It will be what the market wants. Consumers are buying the food they find fair, workers are working for a wage they find fair, restaurants are turning a profit that matches the demand. This becomes the new normal and the market stabilizes.

The only way this system results in serious losses for the business is if the price adjustment is so drastic that people decide to have a cost-conscious awakening and start cooking at home. Maybe they realize cooking at home is healthy, and adjust to a goal of losing weight and shedding our obesity epidemic. This starts a spiral of health conscious choices, and they decide that eating healthy means staying away from caloric restaurant foods. So in this scenario, the rise in costs did not hurt the market directly, but it could have indirectly sparked a wave of cultural change that drives consumers away from this type of business.

Notice that in my imaginary scenario, restaurants are going to suffer greatly, but it doesn't mean the economy in general suffers. Consumers are simply taking their business elsewhere: buying groceries, cookbooks, cooking tools and appliances, hiring personal trainers, etc. Their disposable income has simply moved to other areas. So even in this nasty scenario for restaurants, the stock for restaurants may fall, while other business will boom, thus maintaining an overall economy balance.

Having said that, no way US consumers will have a health consciousness awakening over a \~10% increase in the cost of restaurant meals (guesstimate of \~1% cost increase for every $0.50 in wage increase [based on this study](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjJ3pnfk97wAhVLQ80KHZNTCfsQFjAGegQIBBAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fageconsearch.umn.edu%2Frecord%2F33553%2Ffiles%2Ftb991877.pdf&usg=AOvVaw35UukiGIwIU1LyFNT8XPG8)).",[],0
