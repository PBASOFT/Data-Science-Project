So in the Dutch province Groningen there is a huge gas field but due to overextending (too much gas has been “pulled”) many houses in that province have been damaged severely. Because the gas field has become more empty the pressure it held on the soil has been disappearing too resulting in local earth quakes and soil becoming unstable. These 2 effects are damaging many houses in this province which is costing the Dutch government millions in repairing costs. So they want to stop these effects by stopping gas production and insert carbon into the gas field to try and build the soil pressure up again to prevent further erosion and costs/damage.,[],0

54,gzm28vg,2021-05-27,t3_nm1lps,stocks,"Hey! Let me try and answer some of your questions - 
1. AMC - hey, a lot of people got in on investing with GME and AMC, so don’t sweat it. However know that those are very rare events and are not likely to happen again. Your learning should be that don’t invest in hype / meme stocks. Start with ETFs (VTI, QQQ etc.). Invest in companies that you believe in. This has been repeated multiple times - Time in the Market beats Timing the Market. What that means is that play the long game, hold stocks long term and react based on how those companies are performing. 

2. Taxes / Short term vs. Long term gains - Any profit you realize will be taxed. So if you buy a stock and sell for profit - the profit is taxed. How much it is taxed depends on how long you have held your position. If you hold for longer than a year, you fall into long term capital gains tax, which is lower than short term capital gains which is taxed as ordinary income. The profit will be taxable irrespective. Even if you invest it somewhere else, you are taxed on the profit you made from the sale.

3. 401K and Roth IRA are tax advantaged retirement schemes. You can’t transfer stocks from your brokerage to your retirement fund. However, you can use your 401K/IRA funds to invest in different portfolios. I would suggest not to gamble with your retirement money. Choose a risk profile depending on your age / appetite and let that money compound and grow. Use extra money to invest in individual stocks. 

4. You will have a different account for each service - A Vanguard Brokerage account, a Roth IRA account, 401K etc. They are different from each other and not part of the same pool of money. 

5. I am not sure about funding a Roth IRA using 401K. They are quite different. For your 401K, you are deducted pre tax, but are taxed when you get the money back at retirement. For Roth IRA - you contribute post tax money, however, when you withdraw at retirement, you don’t pay any tax. 

There are lots of articles out there that go into the basics of your question. Take some time to read up on those. Hope this helps.","['GME', 'AMC']",0

But that said the market is the market, you could have 10 identical companies but only 1 of them comes out as the one increasing by far the most, so do you want to invest into all 10 and divide profits/losses or hope to find the 1 increasing so much? In reality it's not 1 and 10, but 10 to 1000 or even more, depending on which sector and what you are looking for. And both will result in kind of the same. The less stocks you choose to invest in, the higher the risk of underperforming or even face losses. The more stocks you invest in, the lower the risk of underperformed but you will minimize potential profits.

And if you now take 100 people that invest into 1-2 stocks the 10 of them that were successful will tell you that its better to do so, while the 90 that underperformed the S&P 500 or had a loss will either stop trading or not talk about it, giving you a wrong perception.",[],0

The kind of stuff you can do with quantum would be like things that are traditionally incalculable. So think an insane number of sensors, like 1,000,000 sensors (kind of like our own bodies), all talking at the same time and asking a CPU to make a decision based on live data on the fly. A binary computer cant really do that easily. It will need a lot of help like a bunch of co processors along every group of sensors or more cores or some good way to thread, or a GPU, etc. And even then, there are measurable limits that are hard to overcome in binary. This is where the quantum would excel. It may not be very fast at operations, but it can do a ton of them at once (in theory).

One thing I will say is I have a feeling that the quantum computer is likely to become more of a add-on to current computer rather than replace them. This would give you the best of both worlds.

Stocks are also a contract. It grants you the right to assets and production of a company both current and future. In theory, if said assets were sold, you would get a cut equivalent to your contract stake. In many ways, the asset it worth more than the cash you can extract.

In Dec 2020, the proposed sale was announced. In March 2021, the board of AJRD approved the sale and declared a special 5 dollar dividend. All recent actions of the company implies that the sale will be approve. Currently it is being reviewed by pentagon and FTC and the final decision will be announced by the second half of this year. All actions of ARJD over the past few months implies that the sale will be approved by the regulators. I believe the expected price point once the sale becomes final would be in the 70 to 80 range with an upside of up to $200 to $300 base on the current price points of other miliary defense companies like  LMT, NOC, RTX and BAH. Currently the price of the stock is around 48 which is bery cheap for a military defense company. It has been consistently profitable and is one of the biggest rocket suppliers of NASA , US Government , Lockheed and Raytheon. Yesterday, I noticed in the time in sale of AJRD that a big investor has been loading up on the stock buying 73,894 shares 5 different times (block trades) with a price point of $48.27.

Even here in the US people complain about gas prices going up, but still will buy big SUVs and go for camping trips in the mountains. The cost of gas is minimal compared to what people spend in housing, healthcare and taxes. My cars always costed more in maintenance and insurance than in gas and I travel a lot. And plane tickets are just marginally affected by oil prices as well. No more than 20% of a ticket costs is out of fuel. If the fuel doubles the price (impossible) the ticket will increase from $100 to $120, hardly beyond the change of plans threshold of those who can afford travelling by air. Most of the costs are maintenance, capital immobilization of expensive airplanes, airport use, staff and taxes.

>Too bad because of your anti-corporate bullying stance you seem to be against using any market forces to make this happen so I guess just more hand waving is your platform?

?? I stand to what I said. The solution is much cheaper than diluting the higher fuel prices into the whole society. A small bump in fuel prices makes little difference in demand, but people will get poorer out of it (even if just a small fraction out of everyone).

Shares have value because of a social contract. Management is expected to act with your interests in mind. You basically have to trust them.
Sure, you can sue if they don’t respect their duties, but if it comes to that you are unlikely to successfully extract much value back from the whole endeavor, plus the wasted time and effort.

In practice then, **value comes mostly from trust**. Your trust that the company will act in your best interest. And the trust of other investors that, believing the same, will be willing to buy the company’s shares from you.

As you noticed, some companies don’t give back money to shareholders either directly with dividends or indirectly by buybacks, so **owning shares is like owning fiat money**.

So. 
1: You can realize some of the gains to get to right balance and this will give you some cash to see where things go in the next few: days, weeks, months. Ie new buying opportunities.

2:Add to under-performer to meet ratio. ie Get portfolio risk back to prior level.

Those are my main holdings and they’re doing great. No huge fluctuations, never a bad time to add in the long term unless WW3/Asteroid, in which case your money isn’t going to save you.

Learn how to read a balance sheet, but don’t turn a blind eye to future momentum. The market is illogical sometimes and you can make nice returns out of swing trading catalysts.

Basically as a natural gas producer (AR) and their associated pipeline (AM) both companies were hurt badly by the covid shutdown and the market drove their share prices down due to perceived bankruptcy risk.  They have since recovered and the market agrees as shown by their appreciated share prices.  

Since they are energy companies they have high debt to cover their high demand for assets, but that is typical for the industry.  The question is whether they have the cash flow to pay the interest and when full debt repayment is due whether they can pay or refinance to a longer term.  IMO both AR and AM have done an excellent job navigating this crisis with their debt service well managed and under control.  AR's cash flow has increased significantly to the point where they will likely either initiate a share buyback or start paying a dividend in the next year or so.  AM continues to pay a good dividend- currently 9.3%.

This is not true and could make readers believe that are assets will be converted into cash at some point.

Here is the definition of an asset as per IFRS : An asset is a present economic resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events. An economic resource is a right that has the potential to produce economic benefits.

An asset would not necessarily result in cash in the future. It could be traded for another assets. It could simply be useful in order to produce something (e.g. permit for the lumber industry or mining industry).

The values recorded can be very understated in comparison to their actual fair value. This gets especially bad if the numbers you are using are net of accumulated depreciation.

680,gzmzu8x,2021-05-27,t3_nm5s7u,stocks,"So, there's a common misconception for a number of investors between *risk* and *volatility*. Volatility refers purely to price action - how dispersed prices are around the mean. Volatility really just gives you a frame of reference for the typical distribution profile of some investment. Risk, on the other hand, is the chance that an event has an effect on the investment thesis. This can include known risks (regulatory risk, which materialized with BABA as legal harassment from the CCP) and unknown risks (like with early stage companies, where there is an indefinite number of things that can go wrong leading up to profitability). 

 Not investment advice, but major things I'd look at here in terms of risk: 

1. The distinction between the Momentum Index and the Momentum Tilt index. Make sure you know which one you want - the former is riskier by virtue of being less diversified. 
2. What's in the rest of your portfolio? One thing to be careful of with factor ETFs is that many can have you unknowingly over-exposed to the same particular companies. For instance, if your other holdings (even if ETFs) are heavily weighted to AMZN, TSLA, MSFT and AAPL you're going to be adding idiosyncratic exposure to these companies by virtue of the fact that they are ""high momentum"" currently. Look at the sector/ region exposure while you're at it. 
3. The biggest thing that worries me about this is the ad-hoc rebalancing criteria. The index rebalances twice a year (quite infrequent, in the scheme of things) and has an ad-hoc rebalancing criteria that seeks volatility above the 95th percentile of index history. I would do a little work in a spreadsheet to find out what this means in practice, because you may wind up about 6 months behind major market regime shifts.

>>>  ""Shipment and revenue declines reflected the natural seasonal pattern in our distributed generation business, combined with our ongoing pause in large scale. Gross margins were relatively stable considering the volume decline, with better average selling prices offsetting volume deleveraging,"" Chief Executive Jeff Waters said.

""Operating expenses ran higher sequentially, but in line with projections. As we conclude the remaining SunPower separation activities, we expect to bring operating expenses down in the quarters ahead,"" Mr. Waters said.

Raymond James said in a note, which reiterated its Strong Buy rating, that ""as had been telegraphed in April, cost pressure vis-a-vis glass, cells, and logistics - an industrywide trend - was a noticeable headwind.""

Maxeon guided for second-quarter shipments of 415 MW to 475 MW and revenue of $165 million to $185 million.

""As with the entire value chain, input cost inflation remains a headwind in 2Q,"" Raymond James said in its note.

""There is no avoiding the current headwind from input cost inflation ... but history's lesson is that everything in the solar space is fundamentally a commodity, and all bottlenecks are always transitory,"" the analyst note said.

All central banks downplay inflation. Always have, always will. The CPI is designed to downplay inflation. This isn’t lying but rather forcing the market to show it’s true colors rather than being reactionary to Central Banks comments. And it’s quite obvious the Central Banks aren’t going to make kneejerk reactions to 1 month of data. Nor should they.

That said, Bank of Canada basically said they are raising rates in 2022. They are also already scaling back bond purchases. They have other means of slowing down stimulus before they raise rates. That’ll take months anyways and viola, 2022 is here.

Bank of England said inflation was transitionary, but they are monitoring closely. Lack of conviction, framing an easy out. They also are thinking inflation is transitionary because of weak wage growth.

However, in the US, via stimulus, the effective minimum wage has risen to $15/hour. Democrats backdoored that via unemployment benefits. Businesses are being forced to pay above unemployment or lose business; and they are raising wages. 3 months to go on that with no word on if it will be extended or they will push a permanent $15/hour min wage.

You have a variable risk target - the usual approach is to set the risk target independently and go from there. This is going to represent one ""variance unit"" in your portfolio. 

Now you'll need to solve a system of equations. Given P (Portfolio value), a (number of VOO shares), b (number of VTI shares), VOO and VTI (prices, respectively): 

1. P = aVOO + bVTI
2. P / STDEV (P) = a(VOO)/ 0.6STDEV(VOO) + b(VTI)/0.4STDEV(VTI)

Along comes McDonald's.  They're already a public company. They've done all the complex work.  They agreed to buy you.  It's a pretty fast and easy acquisition type of transaction, much simpler and quicker than going public yourself.  You go from owning shares of your own private business to shares of a public business, without the headache and risk of an IPO.  

Now consider the same scenario, except it's not McDonalds, it's some other company that is public but their main focus so far is just finding some business like yours to acquire.  They're already public, so that part is done. It's just a matter of making sure the have investors with the money and then working out what everyone thinks is an ok price.  

From the retail investor side, they've going tired of IPO's.  They've seen time and again where only ultra rich insiders get a chance to buy them, and even they have no visibility into how much they'll be allocated.  Nobody knows what day it will happen, or even what time when that day is set.  Even up to the last second, nobody knows what price they'll be paying or what the venture they're investing in is even worth.  And what it's worth in the morning can be radically higher or lower later that day.  It's a blind crapshoot.  A spac takes a lot of that nonsense away.  The venture is soberly considered over a period of months.  A price and valuation are arrived at in a non-hurried and somewhat sane manner.

982,gznfl9l,2021-05-27,t3_nlilhm,stocks,"I’m long Ford and it is the largest component of my portfolio.

Ford is not trying to reinvent the wheel and they’re not trying to be the Apple of the automotive industry like Tesla or the aspirational pipe dream companies (e.g., Rivian, Lordstown, Nikola) are all trying to be. Ford recognizes that until fully autonomous vehicles become a practical reality for the average consumer, most people will not want their driving experience to change all that much. Most people don’t want to feel like they’re in a minimalist spaceship despite what the Tesla circlejerk would have you believe (although I’m also long TSLA for other reasons which I’ll explain below). Ford’s electrified vehicles feel more like a typical car. It doesn’t feel like a radical change in your daily driving experience. Most people don’t like radical and rapid change. They like what they are familiar with. Ford gets that. The F-150 Lightening shows that they get it.

Ford is going all in on electric. So is VW and GM. Through their collective weight, institutional knowledge bases, and economies of scale they’re going to eventually crush Tesla and all the relatively new automotive manufacturers who all want to fundamentally and radically change people’s driving experiences. In 2020 Tesla delivered roughly 500,000 vehicles globally. Compare that to Ford delivering nearly 4.2 million (and in non pandemic years Ford is pushing 6 million deliveries annually). Volkswagen Group delivered 9.2 million vehicles across all brands in 2020. I just don’t think Tesla can stay competitive as a mass market auto manufacturer in the long run despite their impressive growth in production in recent years.

Where Tesla can excel (and this is why I’m long TSLA) is by pivoting to becoming an OEM supplier of batteries to major automakers like Ford and VW Group who have gone all in on electric and have the production capacity to drown out Tesla as an automaker. Tesla knows high capacity batteries better than just about anyone. But more importantly, Tesla understands how to produce large quantities of batteries and is constantly pursuing ways to expand their already impressive battery production capabilities. They have the potential to become the go to energy storage solutions provider to everything ranging from the automotive industry to construction/heavy industry and utilities/power producers. Tesla was only able to make the demand for high capacity batteries that currently exists by stimulating the growth of the EV market with their own cars. But they’ve done that, and I think they’ll eventually back out of the business of building cars and selling them to consumers (at least if they’re smart). 

Ford is a great automaker play. Tesla is a great battery and energy storage play. It’s frustrating for me to see people constantly compare the two to each other.

Best of luck with your investing journey, OP!",['TSLA'],1

You can offset short term gains with short term losses (stocks held less than 1 year) and long term gains with long term losses. But you cannot offset a short term gain with a short term loss. Additionally, there are restrictions around repurchasing a stock after selling for a loss that can impact your ability to deduct the loss.",[],1

990,gzng3l8,2021-05-27,t3_nmafh5,stocks,"Traditionally banks have done *better* when rates are higher.  They pay a low amount of interest on deposits, and they charge a higher amount to lend.  That difference is called spread and the spread is proportionally higher when rates are higher.  

But it's not just about raw differential, it's also about derivatives of that, such as how the relative curves are moving, and how quickly.  

You also have parameters that can influence things.  One such parameter was made clear in a recent bank conference call in which the CEO said certain large customer segments have 3-7x as much in their savings accounts than they did prior to the pandemic.  That parameter says there's a lot of deposits made at low rates, and therefore not a lot of demand for banks to give those savers much of a rate.  Meanwhile, there's a rising demand for lending.  That's a double bonus.",[],0

998,gzngkh2,2021-05-27,t3_nmafh5,stocks,"Banks do well because of higher interest rate but not necessarily due to inflation.  So if interest rates go up to keep inflation low but the inflation has not actually materialized then this is good for banks.  

Higher rates means that banks make more money on the deposits they have.  They take in money in your savings accounts, cds, etc, and pay you  a fraction of what it is worth and then turn around and loan it out to someone else for a much higher rate (some of that is due to default risk etc).  The issue is that the spread between loan rate and savings rate use to be higher but because the fed rate is near zero and banks are unwilling to go negative on interest rates to their customer the spread has been shrinking.  As we saw when the fed rate was over 2% higher just 15 months ago most banks were still not passing on that extra rate to savers and were pocketing the difference.  Theoretically there is a max to this, where savings rates will eventually go up with the fed rate as well, but it has been so long since that has happened it may not go back up since consumers have gotten use to not getting paid much for their cash.",[],0
