But about 2 days ago, I bought a call as spy was going up. It went up about 40-50c but the amount of return I got was about 2-5%. I assume this is because the contract prices just start shooting up while I was going in it?

So is it best to buy an option contract when the stock starts going straight or straight down that you would make a call or a put knowing when it was reverse? So I assume the option contract isn't worth as much? Is this the best way to buy options in the most optimal price?",ng9vt5,[],0

The thing is that I don't get this margin closeout that they keep notifying me of. I understand that having a margin closeout, obviously, is like losing money. But do they matter in the long run as long as I don't close the positions?

 SANTA CLARA, Calif., May 19, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [AMD](https://www.amd.com/) (NASDAQ: AMD) today announced that its Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program. Under this program, the company intends to repurchase up to $4 billion of outstanding AMD common stock. AMD expects to fund repurchases through cash generated from operations which have been strengthened by the company’s strong operational results.  


“Today’s announcement reflects our confidence in AMD’s business and the successful execution of our multi-year growth strategy,” said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD president and CEO. “Our strong financial results and growing cash generation enable us to invest in the business and begin returning capital to our shareholders.”

Under this program, which is designed to return value to AMD stockholders, offset dilution from stock issuances, and reduce share count over time, the company will repurchase stock in the open market. This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.",ngaugk,[],0

The online marketplace for used luxury goods late Monday posted financial results for the first quarter that are not being well received by the Street. The  RealReal  (ticker: REAL) reported revenue for the quarter of  $98.8 million , up 27% from a year earlier and ahead of the Street consensus forecast of  $95.9 million . Gross merchandise volume was  $327 million , also up 27%. On a non-GAAP basis, the company lost  49 cents  a share, in line with the Street consensus.
For the second quarter, the company sees GMV about flat sequentially in the  $320 million  to  $330 million  range, but up 75% to 80% from a year earlier -- an easy comparison given the deep decline in the business during the pandemic last spring. The company did not provide more detailed guidance on the quarter or any outlook for the full year.

Love me a good gap-down recovery play. REAL is trading well under it's previous high after lackluster earnings early last week. Massive volume shelf supporting price between $13 and $15.50. Looking for an entry below $14 for a swing to fill the gap up.",ngb1y7,[],0
386,2021-05-19,stocks,"KT Corp. is launching AMD processor-based virtual server IaaS products for the first time in the country's cloud operators.  AMD servers are 80% of the existing same-specification server fee, freeing up high-performance computing resources at an affordable price for enterprise customers.
AMD servers can be applied to a variety of business applications, including the general web, middleware, as well as databases and big data analytics.
Existing systems can also be easily migrated to industry-standard x86 architectures, making them suitable for customers who need better performance for the price.  KT's self-validation shows that AMD servers perform at the same level as Intel server CPU cascades operating on the KT Cloud D1 platform. As a result, enterprise customers preparing for large-scale deployments are expected to significantly reduce their total cost of ownership (TCO) by utilizing AMD servers.  AMD servers are available on the D1 platform in the KT Cloud, which is more secure and flexible than regular public cloud zone. After launch, the company plans to continue to expand not only the D1 platform, but also kt G-Cloud and F-Cloud.  The D1 platform is built with physical security equipment such as IPS, firewalls, and VPNs for excellent security stability.  In addition, up to 15 DMZ and private networks can be flexibly created, and all network and firewall policies can be easily set up within the cloud console. In addition to servers of the same specifications as previous servers, they also offer high-spec servers with up to 128vCore x 256GB of memory.

Finally I did some googling, because I haven’t been able to find a way to actually contact their help to find out where it is, and you have to go in and claim your “chances”. Why would they call them “chances” when you’ve already earned them? Why doesn’t it just say claim your complimentary (sub won’t let me use the other word) stock? I never clicked on “chances” because that seemed like where you go to try to earn more with referrals. So now I finally try to go that way to claim them and they say they’re expired.

558,2021-05-19,stocks,"I really don't understand this shit.

All the time now, a company performs well and the stock price drops because of it. Take Lowe's today for example. It blasted earnings. It literally doubled them. 8th earnings in a row it has smashed, and today it's down. Literally, you have a company coining it in, and the share price is dropping. (I dont own it btw, so this isn't a rant on that basis)

I know the argument is ""ThE WhoLE MaRkEt Is DoWn"". Sorry, no, I don't buy this bullshit.

Let's look at todays winners;

Advaxis is the 2nd biggest gainer today and is up 21%. It's a garbage fucking pennystock that trades at 0.58 cents. Even worse, it's a bullshit pharma stock. Normal volume is 6 million. Volume today - 166 million. There is no news to justify this interest

Mosys is the big winner so far, up 33%. Another bullshit $5 stock. Normal volume is 2 mil. No news, but today the volume is 30x the norm.

LifeMD has had lawsuits filed against it today, about claims its directors have comitted fraud. Even better;

**LifeMD appears to use unlicensed doctors to dispense OTC medications, has implemented an autoshipping/autobilling scheme, failed to honor guarantees, and put in place abusive telemarketing practices.**

So what does the stock do in response to this? Of course, it jumps 12%.

To end my rant, the 3rd placed highest today is another bullshit company, a Chinese medical company called Lianluo Smart. There's one single news article linking it to a takeover by newegg or something, the news article made little sense. Low and behold, normal volume is 400k, today it's 9 million. Even if the news is to be believed, this one single article was posted 1 hour ago, yet the price suddenly spiked 2 hours ago.

So, why do companies that do well, make money, smash earnings lose their stock value, and bullshit, nonsense companies get P&D so much. This is a daily occurance. Every single day I see a new company increasing its share price by 50%+ and it's nonsense. I thought P&D's were illegal.
