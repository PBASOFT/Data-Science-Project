Your perspective is little different from which you disagree with, and has to be noted that neither belongs to a serious investor.

Investing, like any other activity you do purposefully, should be taken seriously.
You don’t go to college thinking you won’t learn anything. Don’t apply for a job expecting to get fired. Investing is no different, if you take it as a serious endeavor.

The mindset of failure justifies who is just out for the excitement and fun, pass some time, gamble and maybe win something nice. Comparing it to a vacation underscores a perspective to play for enjoyment rather than work for productivity.

121,gzhse0l,2021-05-26,t1_gzg3nwu,stocks,"Okay, your comment is clearly so based on false information that I'll break a few of them down.

> Apple also manages good returns despite having a horrible market share for computers, yet profitable.

Apple's returns come from their sticky products and software revenues, exactly the same business model Tesla is going after. On the other hand, Tesla is exactly the opposite of Apple. Apple is the premium brand with great products, but much worse specs than the competition for a higher price. Tesla is the premium brand with great products, but much better specs than the competition for the same price.

> Tesla for one has had a few good years with minimal competition and easy life, though nowadays everyone is going electric and fast!

This is an easy way to make it sound like that would be terrible for Tesla, but it only matters if others are actually making better cars, which they are not.

> Tesla has been unable to keep their lead in both technology, car quality or marketshare.

Let's break them down one by one:

* Tesla is clearly still miles ahead in terms of technology. Anyone who's serious can see that, but in case you're somehow to blinded by misinformation to realize this just look at the fact that the Cybertruck beats the electric Hummer and F150 in every single spec for the same price.
* Tesla has never been in the lead in terms of car quality, but they've been rapidly increasing their car quality and have already jumped ahead in some areas this year, with the single-piece casting of the underbody and their superior electrical wiring for example.
* Market share is largely irrelevant, as no company can maintain their market share when their market had no other brands competing before to lots of people competing today. As long as Tesla is selling every car they make, what matters is not their EV market share but their overall automotive market share, and here Tesla is still rapidly gaining ground.

> Their cars are getting more problems and start to get a tarnished reputation (the other day they had their own ""battery gate"").

This is absolute BS. Tesla has had negative press from the start and it's not getting better or worse, it's just misinformation from media that want to tarnish Tesla's reputation because they don't do advertising and they'll hurt the media's business model if they succeed. Stories like the ""failing brakes"" in China recently are quickly proven false, but the stories stick because people are more interested in negative stories than positive. Ultimately this doesn't matter though, as people will realize they're BS when they hear from friends and families how great their Tesla is.

> Their driving assistance has not outperformed the competition in any test done by a objective third party, on the contrary.

Completely false. While their are some third parties that are funded by other brands (such as Consumer Reports which is largely funded by Ford) and naturally lean towards the companies funding them, the actually independent parties all rank Tesla's driving assistance as the best, although it's often masked by bringing other factors into the overall scoring to make Tesla not the overall winner (again because of the advertising argument).

> And their marketshare in Europe in general and Norway in particular is deep red.

Cherry picking one continent or even country is extremely shady, especially because Tesla doesn't even have a factory in Europe yet.

> Elon going to China to try to butter up Xi Jinping by praising the dictator is a show of fear.

Lol, extremely subjective speculation...

> Tesla is bleeding in Europe, they need a new market...one with less competitors

Already answered this. Total bs as long as they're selling every car they make and scaling like crazy.","['AAPL', 'TSLA']",1

It's true that keeping a large chunk of money in a savings account with a near-zero interest rate for a few years is suboptimal because it will lose value as a result of inflation, but you also have no worries about how much money will be available when it's needed.

In practice it would've been a bit lower due to dividends, maybe 65-70%.

The higher prices that they charge ostensibly cover costs with plenty to profit. Do you think they would be investing so many millions of dollars into creating this technology and developing it if they didn't have something as simple as their profit margins figured out? 

To go back to the skydiving example (which literally does include the high costs of traveling in a plane btw), it would not be profitable to charge people standard travel prices when they're cranking a high performance plane up to 10,000 feet and back multiple times a day (which is extremely taxing on the engine and airframe).

The argument I'm making is it eliminates your ability to stick with a plan. If you have a strong risk appetite, you can go 100% stocks, no bonds or cash, and that's your right. If your time horizon is 20+ years, you can literally just ignore the daily price swings because they mean nothing to you. Same with if you use your portfolio for income but have no intention of selling.

But the moment you introduce margin into your portfolio, those price swings become very relevant, and you give up control.

It's for that reason that I consider 100% equities the maximum risk exposure a retail investor should take. 

If you're comfortable taking on additional risk and want to enhance returns beyond 100% equities, IMO you'd be better off factor investing with value stocks, perhaps with weighting towards small cap, which has higher historical returns than the SP500. That would provide better risk adjusted returns than relying on margin.",[],0

745,gzindhi,2021-05-26,t3_nlgtcs,stocks,"Depends what you mean by ""day trading"". Many people use this term as a synonym to mean different things.  


If you mean buy underlying stock and sell it after it goes up at least 1% on the day, you're to lose money over time. Nobody can predict the future, and nobody knows which way a stock will move on any particular day. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Putting money into a few stocks and hoping they go up on the day is no better than going to the casino and hoping the roulette wheel falls on black. You might hit, and you might hit a streak for a while, but anyone who has studied this can tell you that, statistically, you will not outperform the market over time.  


Conversely, if by ""day trading"" you mean having a lot of call/put spreads that require you to enter, roll, and close (i.e. manage) your position on a daily basis because you are adequately leveraged across dozens of stocks across many sectors, then yes you can make a reasonable and safe return on your investment on a daily basis. However, you'll need at least $1m in principal before you can make enough to replace an $80k-$100k/year full-time employment. You'll also need a great deal of patience, which most people don't have.

REITs were worse hit during the recession than the stock market and were how a lot of people got burned. The great recession basically disproved the notion of safe REITs. They recovered, sure, but not everyone could afford to wait for recovery and losing 50% of your entire net worth will cripple you if your living expenses exceed what those losses will cover.

The examples here and the whole point of the post is that panic selling isn't the only reason people end up needing to sell. Many that overextend themselves believe that in a crisis they can just pull the money out like a savings account but they fail to consider that economic crashes often result in job losses as well and don't maintain emergency liquid assets. 

Using the 50% loss model, let's say you have 50k in stocks, 5k in the bank and on average you need 8k a month for living expenses (we live in LA so 8k is a pretty normal number). Crash occurs, you lose your job and have no income coming in, and now you have 25k in stocks that won't recover for another year or more. By the end of the month you'll need to withdraw at least 3k. Even with unemployment which pays maybe 1k a month, you would need to sell nearly all your assets at a 50% loss just to stay afloat within a matter of months. When people say don't invest more than you can afford to lose this is what we're talking about. Too many people think they can afford to lose their savings because the depend on their job to continually bring in income and just assume they'll be able to make up the loss eventually.",[],0

You are buying contracts that let you buy (sell) the stock at an agreed upon price (the strike) up until the agreed upon date (expiry). They are called derivatives because their value is derived from the price of the underlying equity these contracts denote. 

The total value of an option is the sum of its intrinsic and extrinsic values. It's intrinsic value is the different between the strike and the current price of the stock (spot price) with a minimum of 0. The extrinsic value is the value the option gets from the time left to expiry (high chance of movement and being profitable - in the money) and the volatility of the stock.

&#x200B;

Lets do an example:

Today is March 1st. 

Stock XYZ is trading for $100.

You buy 10 lots of calls on stock XYZ with strike of $120 and expiry of May 1st. The premium is $0.30.

You pay $0.30 \* 100 (each lot is for 100 shares) \* 10 (lots) = $300.00

You calls intrinsic value is $0 because your strike price is above the spot price.

The extrinsic value is $300 - all of the value of your calls is derived from the chance that 

You now own those calls that let you buy 1000 (10 \* 100) shares of XYZ by May 1st, for $120.

It is now April 1st. 

XYZ is trading for $130.

The value of your contracts is still intrinsic + extrinsic.

The intrinsic part is now $10 \* 10 \* 100 = $10,000.

The extrinsic part would be the volatility + time value.

If the volatility stayed the same, then the extrinsic would be around 1/2 (there were 2 months to expiry when you bought the calls, and one month left now).

So your options would be worth around $10,150.

You can sell those options, or you can exercise them and force the counter-party that underwrote them to sell you 10 \* 100 XYZ for $120.

1) Economic depreciation are called impairment, I never saw a FS that used the term economic depreciation from my clients. Also, I have never heard the term in my accounting classes. That said, I did not audit all the entities publicly traded so that does not mean the term is never used. I just thought I might as well share the most common term. Furthermore, an entity will register an impairment when the accounting value is higher than the fair value (either the value on the market or the estimated value as per the cash flow. That said, most of the time the two values should be about the same). 

2) PP&E, other tangible assets and intangible assets will go directly in your BS. They won't appear in your P&L, unless you are talking about depreciation. (When you mention the capital expenses)

3) for extraordinary items, I would simply add that the entity has to present them distinctly in the P&L.

Too many people jump in and start researching Elliot waves and candlestick patterns and try to hit grand slams and capture massive gains. They love to tell you about their big wins but leave out all then times they lost their entire initial investment.

I didn’t buy Ford but I did buy GM a while back after seeing the crazy rise of Tesla and their valuation. Turned out very well for me.

Tesla is worth 4.5 times both Ford and GM combined. That is insane. And that valuation showed every manufacturer just how valuable EV is. That showed every major owner of Ford/GM and all executives that their net worth can literally triple if they get EV right. They have logistics, distribution, and footprints that Tesla dreams about. That potential value also easily allows the manufacturers to stop handcuffing themselves to the oil and gas lobbying. Energy companies can’t sky rocket their valuation. EV can.

I can’t deny I’m starting to see Teslas on the road a lot more. But honestly, most people are buying the base model which is kind of ugly and plain when you see the real one in person. Not the add-on loaded one you see in pictures/videos. Just my opinion, not the aesthetic simplicity the likes of Apple products. The premium models are beautiful though; but overpriced.

Basically, that’s why I’m long F and GM. They are still 2-3 years out from actually selling relevant EV. But I’d expect a sharp spike when they officially announce market release of a few models.

 I think there is a least one, maybe two more of these quarterly dips and rises before brazil either 1) breaks it's trend and keeps rising at a steady rate or 2) election cycle chaos causes a 20% dip overnight, in which I'll buy back into right away.

“They’re not the same businesses they were before.

Their capacity and thus ability to generate revenue and profit is much lower but their fixed costs bases are still huge. These businesses will not be profitable again for many years.

Even before Corona, heavy fixed costs and heavy competition meant this was an industry of razor thin margins.

What are my credentials? I spent years working for an airline finally managing their financial planning function.
