**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6zj08b31uhz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=03a9bc191496ffee458247c237e0945fcc4da515)

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/uup5fji2uhz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d272f91bec8cb3d3146b84b850f7f17bbc0c1cf)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company’s latest earnings report. Even though the company’s revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to “Cookie Crisis” - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data – through third-party “cookies” – is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk’s business model.  

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%. 

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company’s earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it’s not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.  

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO’s announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company’s share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst. 

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

Seem familiar?

Bread is one of the worst things in the world, but we’ve always needed it. Until now!

By burning three diff types of meat together, the Tracy Jordan Meat machine takes bread out of the equation!

Now your sandwich is all of the good stuff! That’s delicious. 

Doctor: “And its healthy. Hi, I’m Dr. Leo Spaceman. I’m a working physician with a degree from the Ho Chi Min school of medicine.”

Dr. Spaceman, is it true that bread eats away at your brain?”

Doctor: “We have no way of knowing because the powerful bread lobby keeps stopping my research!”

Well folks, bread will never maybe attack your brain again. Because with the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine, say it with me now:

**FEYE**\- FireEye, I have some of this as the company is highly regarded by cyber security professionals. Often where they go when they need help! Saw them in the headlines this week due to the Colonial Pipeline ransomware. 

&#x200B;

Speaking of Colonial, they just paid the ransomware ransom of 5 million dollars to the group DarkSide who now apparently plans to disband and apologized for all the gasoline worries! How kind.

&#x200B;

**BMW** seems to be decent luxury car maker pure play. 46% owned by two brothers so no risk of takeover, rejecting all the bells and whistles of advertising in favor of simply making a good product and selling it. China sales doubled \[while TSLA sales down in China\]. p/e under 20 for the German ticker. Need to look at the ADR to see how many German shares it represents 

&#x200B;

**Rblx**\- loss of 0.46 per share \[0.25 miss\]; revenue was up 147% YoY\[miss\] and bookings were higher. Daily active users also increased 79% YoY up to 42.1 million. Rblx appears up on the earnings and calls outnumbering puts roughly 3:1 with May 14th 70 call being most actively traded contract as of Tuesday \[source schwab options report\]- I have a handful of shares as tons and tons of daily users.

&#x200B;

Out of China, seeing **speculation** that China’s Crypto is going to be **gold** backed which should be interesting in terms of gold supply and demand. I have a couple shares of some random gold miner and maybe a gold etf I dont know. But yeah. Very interesting and potentially paradigm shift. I could not confirm that it would be gold backed through any article that appeared completely neutral. They would likely try to divest their holdings of US Debt/US Currency prior to formally announcing this as it would cause shocks across the FOREX markets I would think and devalue USD and possibly others.

 

[https://moneyweek.com/investments/commodities/gold/603131/how-much-gold-china-owns-yuan-reserve-currency](https://moneyweek.com/investments/commodities/gold/603131/how-much-gold-china-owns-yuan-reserve-currency) Pretty interesting read. I am and have been bullish on China, I own baba, tencent and many other Chinese tech companies. I think absent some world war or full blow Cold War that China will be the next global super power for good or ill so take that as you will. I also am long the yuan for this reason despite not necessarily supporting China in a social/moral sense.\[lets go back to only doing camps for fun instead of for whole portions of populations for no other reason then ethnic/religious backgrounds!\]

&#x200B;

I am still long on the stay at home thesis, yes there is pent up demand to go out and shop/eat/travel, but after this experience I think people may invest more into their home just so they are not caught off guard if this were to happen again in the future. Combine that with the increased work from home workforce and I think the stay at home stocks will be just fine in the long run.  The sell off in tech is an entry point if you don’t believe that the whole system will ultimately collapse and you have the ability to wait out the downturn.  The only way to time the absolute bottom is blind luck so just buy companies you like at valuations that don’t offend you and I believe you will be fine over the long term.

&#x200B;

We are now showing **Fear** on [https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/](https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/) index.  A year ago it was more fearful, but some great returns were built in those times, so perhaps the recent pullbacks over inflation concerns are overblown.  If you believe in the continued recovery of the world economy then I think definitely time to start being a little bit greedy.  As Buffett and others have said- be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.

&#x200B;

Times like these are where the greatest returns can be born.

&#x200B;

**VMW**\- new CEO techno centric- VMWare. Been with company since 2003 when was still a startup and now 12 billion business. He’s been leading push into selling software that lets companies run their internal and external apps in multiple cloud computing services and in house data centers. NO requirement for employees to return to physical offices full time which seems like Ag old move as some other companies that said would promote people who came back into office over those WFH faced a walkout. The need for options is essential in keeping high value employees without making them feel ostracized for making decisions that are best for themselves and there family. Currently trading in the 156 range yahoo consensus is  170.79; 32 p/e. 4.86 EPS.  Earnings report 5/27/2021, I may try and pick up a couple shares before earnings or see what other options are for long term investment this seems like one to me. I like operators at the head of company over salesman, they can lay the foundation for them to remain relevant and hire other people to toot their horn.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sanctuary, an astrology startup that also sells psychic readings to users for no low price. U.S. laws around psychic readings are patchwork at best, with CEO and founder Ross Clark arguing the app is offering entertainment rather than fortune-telling—exempting it from the more onerous of state laws. The readings, Clark says, is a practice in empathy rather than actually peering into the crystal ball. But still, the question remains, is funding the practice ethical? 

Some investors think otherwise. Lux Capital’s Josh Wolfe on Twitter did not mince his words upon hearing news of the startup’s seed funding: “Seriously shame on anyone funding or encouraging this bullsh\*t. No doubt there is demand, but this isn’t peddling entertainment, it’s encouraging slippery slope snake oil flapdoodle.” Here too is Vinod Khosla at Khosla Ventures in response to Wolfe’s tweet: “Agree. There is also demand for heroin, fat, sugar… I’d be ashamed to fund such a venture.” 

Proponents argue that astrology and psychic readings play a similar role as religion or therapy, while its detractors argue the practice is rooted in pseudoscience. 

 

Disrupters on the dip, possible entry points if like the companies:

&#x200B;

**TSLA**\- recently big dip.  They do have decent advantage in EV market having good tech but there is tons and tons of money being burned by competitors to catch up and overtake. Currently \~36% down from its 52 week highs.

&#x200B;

**ETSY**\- 37% off its 52 week highs. Still vulnerable because growth stock and these will be the first sacrificed in any major downturn. But it is rapidly growing and it is the only one focused solely on creative goods made by artists/entrepreneurs. Gross merchandise sales \[3.1 billion\] 132.3% YOY increase in Q1, net income \[143.8 billion\] up 1048.1% YOY. Yahoo price target consensus at 226.13. Did turn a profit. 3.52 EPS, 46.32 P/E. 20.73 Billion market cap. I own some and have been happy. Seems like they use debt sparingly and have a good cash flow. So probably would sell off in major downturn but doubt would be in danger of bankruptcy or not being able to weather a storm.

&#x200B;

**LOVE**\-Lovesac- American furniture retailer. I’m not sold here but they do modular furniture and apparently doing pretty well. 4 years of double digit net sales growth, expanded digital channels during pandemic, makes products from recycled plastic bottles and furniture built to last lifetime so that is appealing. Yahoo price target consensus for one year at 74.50 which is lower then the \~75 its at now. EPS .96, P/E 79.07. Would think about it if pulled back but not at current price myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some REITS to consider: 

&#x200B;

**FRT**\- Federal Realty Investment trust, focusing on shopping centers, street retail, mixed use. Major markets in LA, DC< NY, Silicon Valley. Many tenants like grocery stores, restaurants, fitness centers, service based business. 3.8% dividend.  I would be worried about the markets they are in as there is a recent exodus from cities like this in favor of the new tech centers such as Austin and Miami. 

&#x200B;

**IIPR**\- Innovative Industrial Properties- this one has been on my radar for a year +, I got in fairly early and sold last march to reap the profits as thought downturn was going to be longer lasting.  I am back in a couple shares and happy. It specializes in medical cannabis growers. So they just set up the warehouses and have triple net leases IIRC so they have virtually no ongoing costs and just reap rent profits. Cannabis use seems to be up big in the pandemic so may be a lasting trend and with it becoming legal in more and more states I think this is a long term smart play.  3.16% dividend on the normal shares and does sell preferred shares with larger dividend as well. Only have one share in the normal, down 3.76% on stock price I bought at and \~4 shares in the IIPR/PRA 9% preferred dividend I am up \~14%. No plans to sell either.

&#x200B;

**STAG**\- stag industrial, inc. invests in warehouses across country, \~40% of portfolio is leased to e-commerce tenants. Biggest tenant is AMZN, but AMZN constantly looking to cut out middle men and achieve vertical monopolies in every field they operate it seems.  The good thing for STAG is that IIRC, this came up on my radar a while back and many of their properties are located in key areas around international airports and there is only so much warehouse space available that is located in key spots like this, so while AMZN can very well replace them in areas that have space, this may not be possible for reasonable costs in metropolitan areas, especially around airport hubs. I do have a couple shares in here and am up \~20% with no plans of selling at this time.

&#x200B;

Will be interesting to see how we do as Mask Mandates are ending across the country as we approach the 4th of July and summer traveling season.  Will enough of America be vaccinated/have natural immunity due to infection to prevent another spike? Will the world get it together before we create and spread a variant that does not respond to vaccines? Time will tell, and possibly present some fire sales if the panic and fear sets in again a la March 2020.

**CriCut**\- Interesting read. Allegedly company that helps people design and build any idea they might have. Growth at triple digit rate. Not profitable. Added 600k new users last quarter. Paid subscriptions up 140% to 1.6 million paid subscriptions. Yahoo price consensus around 27 with 5 analysts weighing in from a low of 23 to a high of 35. Currently \~24-25. Something I will look into...searching online just brings up a bunch of fancy label makers though a nod on website not seeing this design and build any idea so not sure what this article is talking about. If anyone sees something I missed let me know because from article looked very interesting. Not so much after looking at website and reading the wiki.

5,2021-05-16,nds43l,StockMarket," Taking a look at the 30min chart on $**ELYS** , there's a golden cross incoming. A higher relative volume of almost 3x has led this ticker to soar on Friday. Looking at the daily chart, all indicators are converging on bullish

A break of 4.50/5$ leaves room up to 5.75+ if the volume continues, that would be the next level of major resistance.

I've been hearing the same argument since early 2019. ""When the tech bubble pops... bla bla bla... so don't go all in on tech stocks"". Yet here we are. Tech stocks are stronger than ever. What strong indication is there that tech stocks will just suddenly pop and the rest of the market will be stronger than them? I'm talking long term.

Perhaps it's time to face our new reality and accept the fact that we live in a highly technological society where everything to a huge degree depends on tech.

Now I don't mean every tech stock is the same. I'm talking about big names. I'm saying that one can outperform S&P500 by going all in on big tech stocks or just investing in only-tech ETFs.

I for one simply cannot see Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Nvidia, Microsoft, etc. going anywhere anytime soon. And for that very reason I don't see anything wrong going all in on those stocks.

Once again, I'm talking LONG TERM (5+ years).

Bottom line is: pick a few tech stocks (trustworthy names such as Facebook, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Microsoft) OR pick a good tech ETF OR if you feel adventurous pick a leveraged ETF (NYSE:FANG+, FNGU, etc.) and forget about S&P500 and other sectors.

I'm interested in better understanding the maths behind the computation of the values of a given stock. Not ROI or anything related to investment strategies.

The stock market is a transaction based system, people buy and sell (with different mechanisms) and a stock value fluctuates based on those transactions.

Assuming that a stock is worth $100 when buying what is the mathematical process to compute the stock value after one transaction ? What are the parameters that are being considered ? 

I saw many things about evaluating the value of the stock for pre-IPO companies and I know that in some occasions actual people can do some arbitration on them but it seems very unlikely that this is not already automatized.

58,2021-05-17,nekqvi,StockMarket,"Hey Y'all!  
Below is a letter they had issued to their investors, as per the website 'Seeking Alpha'. Looks like someone more wants to be proved wrong!!  🚀  🚀  🚀

\*\*We took a small short position in GME (167 USD). We will continuously hedge the position to avoid being forced out at an inconvenient moment for an inappropriate reason.

The risk is that the market continues to value GME more like art, as to say there is no direct link to the capacity of generating earnings. It could be a symbol for the art of betting against the suits (that’s how many of these social media participants call Wallstreet’s elite). GME stands for the social media provoked short squeeze, like Kleenex for tissues, Zamboni for ice resurfacer, or Jakuzzi for a bubble bath. Any important influencers can restart the currently weakened spread of the narrative. Knowing this, other market participants might bet on exactly this occurrence and by their actions, increase the probability of it.

However, I believe that time runs against them. The spread of the narrative tends to weaken over time. There will be new exciting subjects in our fast-moving world.

The whole trade is based on masses trying to destabilize the offer and demand of the shares. There is no double cushion as to say that the holder benefits at one point from an intrinsic value in the form of dividends or liquidation (the trust of being able to perform both is often sufficient). This makes the trade very fragile during stressful market conditions.

We should not forget that GME is still a retail company that faces declining revenues due to the online streaming competition, a company that has been looking for a buyer for years. Of course, the 550 million USD that the company managed to raise will influence its odds, but does this justify a 10-billion USD difference outcome? Also to be noted is that the company lost several key people.

Many market participants have been caught on the wrong side of this trade. They will anticipate that this can happen again and take precautions. So, several significant hedge funds do not publish their short book on social media anymore to avoid becoming a target. Option sellers will increase the price of the concerned call options to make the trade less attractive.\*\*

This is a portion of some of my recent inflation DD from researching Michael Burry/Scion's recent 13F plays. I thought it was an interesting investing strategy and wanted to share it here in case anyone is interested. There's more research over on [r/Burryology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/) (specifically [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/nepc7l/the_bull_is_gasping_major_themes_from_michael/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)).

***Inflation, inflation, inflation! (21%+ of current holdings)***

If you've been following [r/Burryology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/) since its inception many eons ago (a little over a month ago), you likely guessed that the next 13F would reveal Burry's strategy for hedging and/or profiting off of the inflation situation. Would he buy/hold REITs as the hedge? What about gold, oil, and other commodities? Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS)?

We now have the answer.

Here are the direct inflation plays:

*Put options on* [***Ishares 20+ year treasury bond etf (TLT)***](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/031915/overview-tlt-etf.asp) *-* *12.7% of current holdings*

*Probable Burry thesis:* rising inflation over the mid- to long-term will lead to the need to increase interest rates thus making these 20 year bonds less attractive.

*Some context:* The U.S. Treasury announced plans to start issuing 20-year treasury bonds in January 2020. The benefits to 20 year treasury bonds are that they're relatively safe, their value could increase if interest rates drop, and they're relatively liquid. The cons are that they're over a 20 year period (meaning you lock in very low interest rates at which you get paid), inflation may occur over that 20 year period and lead to an increase in interest rates that you'll miss out on, and rising interest rates in general hurt the value of these bonds ([link](https://www.mybanktracker.com/blog/investing/20-year-treasury-bonds-307834)).

*Call options on* [*Proshares trust ultrashort lehment 20+ year treasury etf (TBT)*](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/TBT/profile) *- 4.1%*

Probable Burry thesis: this is the same 20+ year treasury bond mentioned above so the strategy is likely the same. The difference here is that it's a call on an inverse bond ETF.

*Context:* The ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses that correspond to two times the inverse of the daily performance of the ICE U.S. Treasury 20+ Year Bond Index. (from Zacks article linked above).

*Put options on Ishares* [russell 2000 growth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/russell2000.asp) *etf (IWO) - 3.1%*

*Probably Burry thesis:* There are two possibilities here. One is that the Russell 2000 is overpriced having outperformed the S&P 500 at 81% vs 43% since last May. The other is that inflation will lead to a recession that does actual damage to the economy which effectively makes a short on the Russell 2000 a bet against the overall economy.

*Context:* The Russell 2000 index measures the performance of the 2000 smaller companies that are included in the Russell 3000 index which itself is made up of nearly all U.S. stocks. It is seen as a bellwether of the American economy because it measures the performance of smaller businesses focused on the domestic market. It's considered more cyclical than the larger indexes which is to say that it follows the economy tightly.

***Out with the REITs***

One of the more interesting observations from Scion's Q4 2020 13F was a sleuth of positions in various REITs. He had a little over 17% of the portfolio in REITs:

* Uniti Group Inc - 3.98% (now 0%)
* The GEO Group Inc - 3.51% (now 0%)
* RPT Realty - 4.05% (now 0.5%)
* Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc - 2.81% (now 0.1%)
* CoreCivic Inc - 3.07% (overall net increase in the total position, now 0.7%)

In Q1 2021, REITs accounted for just 1.3% of Scion's holdings. He exited out of Uniti and GEO, trimmed Urstadt and RPT Realty, and increased the CoreCivic position. All-in-all, it seems he's bearish on REITs serving as the best vehicle for profiting off of inflation compared to shorting the 20 year treasury bond.",[],1
74,2021-05-17,nerkwg,StockMarket,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 17, 2021**

The market fell modestly on Monday, as concerns over rising inflation, marked by a higher than expected print in the April Consumer Price Index (CPI), continued. Technology stocks continued their volatility, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) going as low as 1.42% down intraday before recovering and closing 0.59% down. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.26% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed.

Stocks are coming into this week on the heels of an extremely choppy trading period recently, which saw the SPY pulling back 4% before recovering Thursday and Friday of last week after the April CPI and Producer Price Index (PPI) came in higher than expected. The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

The PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers have increased more than expected. Market participants are concerned that high levels of inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. 

While the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents. 

There are several factors, in my opinion, contributing to the rise of inflation. First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. 

Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. One prominent example you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt—incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs—recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, “Given the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying “Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.

75,2021-05-17,nerso1,StockMarket,"**Highlights:** 

BIGG is a blockchain technology company in the crypto space with two solutions: Netcoins, a crypto trading platform primarily targeting Canadian investors, and BitRank and QLUE, products designed to assess risk levels of crypto transactions, and trace transactions for forensic purposes. 

Netcoins reported $1.25M in revenue in February 2021, significantly surpassing Q3-2020 revenue of $643k. BIGG raised over $42M through multiple rounds of financing since the end of Q3-2020, and is currently in a strong cash position. 

The company’s current focus is to position itself as Canada’s leading regulated crypto trading platform. It has filed applications with regulators and is targeting approval for April 2021. Currently, Wealthsimple is the only regulated crypto trading platform in Canada, but it only offers bitcoin and ethereum trading. Major international players (i.e. Binance, Coinbase) are not currently regulated in Canada. 

Bitcoin prices have surged significantly in recent months (up 692% YoY), indicating rising investor appetite for cryptos. The global digital wallet user-base has been steadily increasing. In Canada, the Bitcoin ATM count was 874 at the end of 2020, up from just 58 in 2015. 

In 2021, Mastercard (NYSE: MA), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE: BK), JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) stated their intent to get into crypto offerings. 

With large institutional players entering the sector, and growing retail enthusiasm around cryptos, we believe the emphasis on risk and compliance will grow exponentially. Being one of the first movers, we believe BIGG is well positioned to capture this growth

**Company Overview**

BIGG is a Vancouver based company, with operational presence in the U.S. Currently, the company has two primary operating divisions:

1. Netcoins (primary revenue driver) – online cryptocurrency brokerage, positioning itself to be Canada’s regulated crypto trading platform (application filed for registration from the British Columbia Securities Commission / BCSC, and the Canadian Securities Administrators / CSA).

2. Blockchain Intelligence Group – focused on Anti-Money Laundering (AML), compliance, and other forensic services in the crypto sector using big data.

The company had an average QoQ revenue growth of 47% over the last five quarters. Per management guidance, Q4-2020 (ending December 31, 2020) and Q1-2021 revenues were $950k and $3.5M, respectively.

**Netcoins**

Netcoins was acquired by BIGG on August 1, 2019, for approximately $2.8M (paid in common shares). It has processed approximately $350M in transactions to date, with $178M in the first two months of 2021. It had reported monthly revenue of $1.25M in February 2021 (up 41% MoM, and 2,695% YoY). 

Revenue Model: Commission on trading is the primary revenue driver. Management noted the fee is in the 1% - 1.5% range. We note that this fee is higher than the spot trading rates of larger exchanges. For example, Binance’s fee starts from 0.10%, and Coinbase’s starts from 0.50%. However, management noted that Netcoins’ fee does not have any hidden fees (i.e. spreads), and is competitively priced. Given the recent surge in transaction volume on the platform, we believe users do not perceive Netcoins’ fee to be significantly higher than its alternatives. We believe Netcoins’ differentiating point vs larger international players is that it is integrated with the Canadian banking system. This feature is only provided by a handful of Canadian exchanges like Bitbuy, CoinSmart, Coinberry, etc.

Blockchain Intelligence Group (BIG) The company has disclosed multiple contracts with varied terms, adding up to $1.8M in revenue since 2018. We note that the average contract size is $191k/year.

The platform currently supports seven major currencies (BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, BSV, XRP, and XLM). Under BIG, there are two solutions that complement each other, discussed next: 

BitRank Verified™ BitRank provides users with a safety ranking (risk score) of the wallet involved in a crypto transaction. Risk profiling provides a simple to use safety score between 0 and 100; with 100 representing low risk, and 0 representing a very high-risk profile

This solution is focused on: 1. Complying with Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) standards. 2. Delivering transparency regarding the source and legitimacy of transactions 3. Providing users with confidence that transactions are not involved with, or implicated in criminal activities

Revenue Model: Up-front fee and a license fee (undisclosed); additional service charge for forensic investigation assistance, and other features. Target Client-base: Risk and credit management companies, financial institutions, ATMs, exchanges and investment platforms, government agencies, crypto-mining companies.",[],0

Given that shareholders will vote next week to merge with SOFI, it's the perfect catalyst for IPOE to have shorts squeeze this week. If we pass share price $17.50, $20.00, and $22.50, Market Makers(MMs) will need to buy 3.75 Million shares. This will give a big boost to the share price. This setup can only work this week only, with millions of new shares being added by SOFI merge, we might never get this chance. As the price rise, MMs will need to secure more shares to cover future contracts too.

Why is this an ideal setup?

1. short interest is rough 32%
2. the average volume is 3M so low volume.
3. On May 7, 2021, when the merge was announced the price jumped from 14.90 to 16.99 in a matter of minutes. Proving the low volume wall. This spike was caused by 2M(total Volume of the day: 5M) additional volume compare to 3M (last 3 months average volume). Just imagine what can 5M new volume can do here. During its prime, it traded around 20M per day.

Do your own research and be impressed. This is not stock advice, this is just my thought. I own shares and call in this Stock.

160,2021-05-18,nf4apu,StockMarket,"When I first heard about Forex trading around 2004, (this was before crypto trading existed) I was immediately intrigued and fascinated.  Every day, for what seems like endless hours, I caught myself daydreaming and thinking about the idea itself and wondering, “What does it really mean?” or “Does this shit really work?”  Let’s say in theory, a person gains some kind of skill or knowledge on how to outsmart the market and through this extraordinary skill, that person is then able to enter trades in what we are told is a global 6 trillion dollar liquid per day market (at that time it was 3 trillion) and be able to get profit from the trades.  Hopefully, the winning trades happen at least a higher percentage of time than the trades that don’t work out, right? And that’s reasonable to expect and doable by an average person, right?  (Ok.  Imagine going back in time to the point before you knew that almost know one ever achieves this and instead, enjoy the naivety and optimism you have for your newly discovered entrepreneurial project.)

Even a beginner can feel what it’s like to have a winning trade and that’s what gets us hooked on the addiction or in more positive terminology we could call it “motivation” or “passion” in Tony Robbins lingo. Yes, some would say it’s a delusional folly based on irrational exuberance. And if there is some special way to put the odds in your favor to have more winning than losing trades it seems like that would do the trick.  It seems like only a slight tweak or adjustment to most people’s trading strategies would activate the tipping point that puts them into the category of winning with consistent increase in capital.  I found plenty of reasons to be positive and optimistic about this project.  Later, I learned that some professionals had fewer winning trades than losing ones but the losing trades were really small and the winning trades were really big comparatively so it ends up creating a consistent increase in capital.  

Ok right.  I get it. But for me, I would prefer to actually know how to enter trades that win a high percentage of time in order to even feel like any increase would be legitimate.   I learned much later that even this belief is caused by unconscious core beliefs that limit success in trading but that’s a story for a later time. Still this desire for perfectionism, minimizing mistakes is part of what drove me to discover what works in trading. It has to be based on what I see is true about the market.  If I can see something is true and not base any trading strategy on something someone told me to do, then I know the probability is based on knowledge and skill and can be considered scientific to an extent. 

And then, the question arose, how much can a person make from trading?  This is a question that really enthralled me to the point of keeping me lying awake at night with wheels turning in my mind about how I would open my laptop for a few minutes at the beach, setting down my virgin margarita (limeade), and make a trade or two and seeing another $50,000 profit in my trading business, which of course, would be a simple easy and massively profitable enterprise. 

If the term “rude awakening” is appropriate for how to describe what actually happened later, that process was not a rude awakening of one day, it was drawn out over months and years of disappointment and struggle. But let’s not go there just yet because if this story leads to any discovery of a way to trade and actually get profit consistently, at least it has a happy ending and my sharing of ways to bypass the ridiculously excruciating trial and error that has happened along the way will be a way to really help a few people to not have to waste nearly as much time and money. 

The amount of wasted money on trading products like courses, software, and seminars has made me a bit of an activist on traders' consumer rights leading to expose some outright scams and deceptions that are so prevalent in the trading world especially in Forex and crypto. After a while, a person can spot the charlatons who have popped up in the Forex niche, people who have never traded successfully but are professional marketers who needed a “product” and were stumped about what to offer the “course junkies” and software addicts in this buying frenzied crowd of newbies as well as seasoned enthusiasts searching for some legitimate way to earn money from what is believed to be an honest skill like being a bricklayer, an architect, or chef. 

I have met many people who take up Forex trading in the hope of creating a part time side hustle income of something like an extra $1000 per month.  And let’s face it, most of us come from working class backgrounds and have a mindset of searching for some income that is enough to pay our living expenses. 

There is a HUGE problem with that idea.  If you believe you can earn consistent profit in trading and you intend to use that skill to make a thousand dollars and then AFTER you spend a few years gaining that skill, you use it by taking out your capital to make sure it never increases so that you limit yourself to ONLY getting $1000 per month, that would not make any sense.  If you ever do get this extraordinary skill you have gained the power to create an income of any amount and make as much wealth as you desire. Trading is not a side hustle.  If you master it you will become wealthy.  If you somehow force yourself to not allow your account to increase in any normal sensible way, it is possible to stop yourself from getting wealthy if you really want that. But that would be like owning a 5 star hotel but only allowing yourself to keep for yourself a receptionist’s salary. 

Not only would it never make sense for any trader who knows how to trade to use that skill to make one or two thousand dollars for paying bills, since we all unconsciously know that to be true it is the source of much of the inner conflicts that prevent traders from being able to trade.  If you don’t know by now, no matter what trading strategy you use and no matter how advanced your understanding of technical analysis is, the results that all traders get are mostly due to unconscious core beliefs.  If you’re not aware that’s true, try typing some keywords into Google and reading a book or two on personal development or psychology. Soon you will run into plenty of proof regarding that fact. 

Trading is not a hobby and not a part time side project.  If you master it, you are wealthy. Period. The unconscious limiting core beliefs that cause people to believe they can earn a couple of thousand dollars from trading and use it to pay their bills, keeps them from ever realizing any mastery in trading.  “Oh, but I don’t want to be one of those greedy rich people!”  This belief stops traders dead in their tracks from ever getting mastery of trading and because the conflict is *unconscious*, most will never know what the real problem is. 

**The Purpose or Intention of This Journey**

That’s what this story is about.  How to get to the bottom of whether there is a way to trade with a high enough probability and not fuck it up with psychological sabotage like suddenly feeling an anxiety attack that shuts off function of the frontal lobes of the brain while trying to remain calm and wise about trading decisions. And for the first step on this journey I have found that getting clear about your purpose for even going on this journey will help to form a clear map that you will create and/or discover for leading you to the goal of using your own knowledge and skill to earn consistent profit that will become any amount you can imagine.  If you succeed in mastering this skill, It’s just a matter of knowing how much time it will take for your account to increase to be the amount you want it to be. 

A valuable exercise to get you going is to get a notebook to use as a trading journal and another one to use as a personal development journal and write down your intention for what you hope to attain through learning to trade with excellence.  How will your life change when you have this skill you seek?  Will you use this skill to help others and participate in some form of philanthropy?  Do you have a mission that requires you to have this skill and this wealth that is for the benefit of others?  It’s ok if you just want to trade to get a dope car and impress girls, have sex and become a cocain addict for your mission. But chances are, if you begin to make contact with any part of yourself that has an intention to fulfill your real purpose, it might involve helping others in some way and maybe even doing something good for the world.  What's important is that before you do this you get clear about *why* you are doing it. People who give up in failure probably don’t know what their reason is for doing this in the first place. 

So to get started, take this step and be serious about it.  Write down why you want to learn to get profit consistently in trading and what you plan to do when that becomes a tangibly manifested reality of your life. No need to share anything on what you intend but being clear with yourself can help you to follow through with that intention. 

Now let the journey begin...",[],0
200,2021-05-16,ndpmh4,StockMarket,"This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6zj08b31uhz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=03a9bc191496ffee458247c237e0945fcc4da515)

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/uup5fji2uhz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d272f91bec8cb3d3146b84b850f7f17bbc0c1cf)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company’s latest earnings report. Even though the company’s revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to “Cookie Crisis” - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data – through third-party “cookies” – is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk’s business model.  

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%. 

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company’s earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it’s not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.  

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO’s announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company’s share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst. 

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

Seem familiar?

Bread is one of the worst things in the world, but we’ve always needed it. Until now!

By burning three diff types of meat together, the Tracy Jordan Meat machine takes bread out of the equation!

Now your sandwich is all of the good stuff! That’s delicious. 

Doctor: “And its healthy. Hi, I’m Dr. Leo Spaceman. I’m a working physician with a degree from the Ho Chi Min school of medicine.”

Dr. Spaceman, is it true that bread eats away at your brain?”

**FEYE**\- FireEye, I have some of this as the company is highly regarded by cyber security professionals. Often where they go when they need help! Saw them in the headlines this week due to the Colonial Pipeline ransomware. 

&#x200B;

Speaking of Colonial, they just paid the ransomware ransom of 5 million dollars to the group DarkSide who now apparently plans to disband and apologized for all the gasoline worries! How kind.

**BMW** seems to be decent luxury car maker pure play. 46% owned by two brothers so no risk of takeover, rejecting all the bells and whistles of advertising in favor of simply making a good product and selling it. China sales doubled \[while TSLA sales down in China\]. p/e under 20 for the German ticker. Need to look at the ADR to see how many German shares it represents 

&#x200B;

**Rblx**\- loss of 0.46 per share \[0.25 miss\]; revenue was up 147% YoY\[miss\] and bookings were higher. Daily active users also increased 79% YoY up to 42.1 million. Rblx appears up on the earnings and calls outnumbering puts roughly 3:1 with May 14th 70 call being most actively traded contract as of Tuesday \[source schwab options report\]- I have a handful of shares as tons and tons of daily users.

Out of China, seeing **speculation** that China’s Crypto is going to be **gold** backed which should be interesting in terms of gold supply and demand. I have a couple shares of some random gold miner and maybe a gold etf I dont know. But yeah. Very interesting and potentially paradigm shift. I could not confirm that it would be gold backed through any article that appeared completely neutral. They would likely try to divest their holdings of US Debt/US Currency prior to formally announcing this as it would cause shocks across the FOREX markets I would think and devalue USD and possibly others.

 

[https://moneyweek.com/investments/commodities/gold/603131/how-much-gold-china-owns-yuan-reserve-currency](https://moneyweek.com/investments/commodities/gold/603131/how-much-gold-china-owns-yuan-reserve-currency) Pretty interesting read. I am and have been bullish on China, I own baba, tencent and many other Chinese tech companies. I think absent some world war or full blow Cold War that China will be the next global super power for good or ill so take that as you will. I also am long the yuan for this reason despite not necessarily supporting China in a social/moral sense.\[lets go back to only doing camps for fun instead of for whole portions of populations for no other reason then ethnic/religious backgrounds!\]

&#x200B;

I am still long on the stay at home thesis, yes there is pent up demand to go out and shop/eat/travel, but after this experience I think people may invest more into their home just so they are not caught off guard if this were to happen again in the future. Combine that with the increased work from home workforce and I think the stay at home stocks will be just fine in the long run.  The sell off in tech is an entry point if you don’t believe that the whole system will ultimately collapse and you have the ability to wait out the downturn.  The only way to time the absolute bottom is blind luck so just buy companies you like at valuations that don’t offend you and I believe you will be fine over the long term.

We are now showing **Fear** on [https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/](https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/) index.  A year ago it was more fearful, but some great returns were built in those times, so perhaps the recent pullbacks over inflation concerns are overblown.  If you believe in the continued recovery of the world economy then I think definitely time to start being a little bit greedy.  As Buffett and others have said- be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.

**VMW**\- new CEO techno centric- VMWare. Been with company since 2003 when was still a startup and now 12 billion business. He’s been leading push into selling software that lets companies run their internal and external apps in multiple cloud computing services and in house data centers. NO requirement for employees to return to physical offices full time which seems like Ag old move as some other companies that said would promote people who came back into office over those WFH faced a walkout. The need for options is essential in keeping high value employees without making them feel ostracized for making decisions that are best for themselves and there family. Currently trading in the 156 range yahoo consensus is  170.79; 32 p/e. 4.86 EPS.  Earnings report 5/27/2021, I may try and pick up a couple shares before earnings or see what other options are for long term investment this seems like one to me. I like operators at the head of company over salesman, they can lay the foundation for them to remain relevant and hire other people to toot their horn.

Sanctuary, an astrology startup that also sells psychic readings to users for no low price. U.S. laws around psychic readings are patchwork at best, with CEO and founder Ross Clark arguing the app is offering entertainment rather than fortune-telling—exempting it from the more onerous of state laws. The readings, Clark says, is a practice in empathy rather than actually peering into the crystal ball. But still, the question remains, is funding the practice ethical? 

Some investors think otherwise. Lux Capital’s Josh Wolfe on Twitter did not mince his words upon hearing news of the startup’s seed funding: “Seriously shame on anyone funding or encouraging this bullsh\*t. No doubt there is demand, but this isn’t peddling entertainment, it’s encouraging slippery slope snake oil flapdoodle.” Here too is Vinod Khosla at Khosla Ventures in response to Wolfe’s tweet: “Agree. There is also demand for heroin, fat, sugar… I’d be ashamed to fund such a venture.” 

Proponents argue that astrology and psychic readings play a similar role as religion or therapy, while its detractors argue the practice is rooted in pseudoscience. 

 

Disrupters on the dip, possible entry points if like the companies:

&#x200B;

**TSLA**\- recently big dip.  They do have decent advantage in EV market having good tech but there is tons and tons of money being burned by competitors to catch up and overtake. Currently \~36% down from its 52 week highs.

&#x200B;

**ETSY**\- 37% off its 52 week highs. Still vulnerable because growth stock and these will be the first sacrificed in any major downturn. But it is rapidly growing and it is the only one focused solely on creative goods made by artists/entrepreneurs. Gross merchandise sales \[3.1 billion\] 132.3% YOY increase in Q1, net income \[143.8 billion\] up 1048.1% YOY. Yahoo price target consensus at 226.13. Did turn a profit. 3.52 EPS, 46.32 P/E. 20.73 Billion market cap. I own some and have been happy. Seems like they use debt sparingly and have a good cash flow. So probably would sell off in major downturn but doubt would be in danger of bankruptcy or not being able to weather a storm.

&#x200B;

**LOVE**\-Lovesac- American furniture retailer. I’m not sold here but they do modular furniture and apparently doing pretty well. 4 years of double digit net sales growth, expanded digital channels during pandemic, makes products from recycled plastic bottles and furniture built to last lifetime so that is appealing. Yahoo price target consensus for one year at 74.50 which is lower then the \~75 its at now. EPS .96, P/E 79.07. Would think about it if pulled back but not at current price myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some REITS to consider: 

&#x200B;

**FRT**\- Federal Realty Investment trust, focusing on shopping centers, street retail, mixed use. Major markets in LA, DC< NY, Silicon Valley. Many tenants like grocery stores, restaurants, fitness centers, service based business. 3.8% dividend.  I would be worried about the markets they are in as there is a recent exodus from cities like this in favor of the new tech centers such as Austin and Miami. 

&#x200B;

**IIPR**\- Innovative Industrial Properties- this one has been on my radar for a year +, I got in fairly early and sold last march to reap the profits as thought downturn was going to be longer lasting.  I am back in a couple shares and happy. It specializes in medical cannabis growers. So they just set up the warehouses and have triple net leases IIRC so they have virtually no ongoing costs and just reap rent profits. Cannabis use seems to be up big in the pandemic so may be a lasting trend and with it becoming legal in more and more states I think this is a long term smart play.  3.16% dividend on the normal shares and does sell preferred shares with larger dividend as well. Only have one share in the normal, down 3.76% on stock price I bought at and \~4 shares in the IIPR/PRA 9% preferred dividend I am up \~14%. No plans to sell either.

&#x200B;

**STAG**\- stag industrial, inc. invests in warehouses across country, \~40% of portfolio is leased to e-commerce tenants. Biggest tenant is AMZN, but AMZN constantly looking to cut out middle men and achieve vertical monopolies in every field they operate it seems.  The good thing for STAG is that IIRC, this came up on my radar a while back and many of their properties are located in key areas around international airports and there is only so much warehouse space available that is located in key spots like this, so while AMZN can very well replace them in areas that have space, this may not be possible for reasonable costs in metropolitan areas, especially around airport hubs. I do have a couple shares in here and am up \~20% with no plans of selling at this time.

&#x200B;

Will be interesting to see how we do as Mask Mandates are ending across the country as we approach the 4th of July and summer traveling season.  Will enough of America be vaccinated/have natural immunity due to infection to prevent another spike? Will the world get it together before we create and spread a variant that does not respond to vaccines? Time will tell, and possibly present some fire sales if the panic and fear sets in again a la March 2020.

**CriCut**\- Interesting read. Allegedly company that helps people design and build any idea they might have. Growth at triple digit rate. Not profitable. Added 600k new users last quarter. Paid subscriptions up 140% to 1.6 million paid subscriptions. Yahoo price consensus around 27 with 5 analysts weighing in from a low of 23 to a high of 35. Currently \~24-25. Something I will look into...searching online just brings up a bunch of fancy label makers though a nod on website not seeing this design and build any idea so not sure what this article is talking about. If anyone sees something I missed let me know because from article looked very interesting. Not so much after looking at website and reading the wiki.

Biggest tenant is AMZN, but AMZN constantly looking to cut out middle men and achieve vertical monopolies in every field they operate it seems.  The good thing for STAG is that IIRC, this came up on my radar a while back and many of their properties are located in key areas around international airports and there is only so much warehouse space available that is located in key spots like this, so while AMZN can very well replace them in areas that have space, this may not be possible for reasonable costs in metropolitan areas, especially around airport hubs. I do have a couple shares in here and am up \~20% with no plans of selling at this time.

Will be interesting to see how we do as Mask Mandates are ending across the country as we approach the 4th of July and summer traveling season.  Will enough of America be vaccinated/have natural immunity due to infection to prevent another spike? Will the world get it together before we create and spread a variant that does not respond to vaccines? Time will tell, and possibly present some fire sales if the panic and fear sets in again a la March 2020.

Paid subscriptions up 140% to 1.6 million paid subscriptions. Yahoo price consensus around 27 with 5 analysts weighing in from a low of 23 to a high of 35. Currently \~24-25.

I've been hearing the same argument since early 2019. ""When the tech bubble pops... bla bla bla... so don't go all in on tech stocks"". Yet here we are. Tech stocks are stronger than ever. What strong indication is there that tech stocks will just suddenly pop and the rest of the market will be stronger than them? I'm talking long term.

Perhaps it's time to face our new reality and accept the fact that we live in a highly technological society where everything to a huge degree depends on tech.

Now I don't mean every tech stock is the same. I'm talking about big names. I'm saying that one can outperform S&P500 by going all in on big tech stocks or just investing in only-tech ETFs.

I for one simply cannot see Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Nvidia, Microsoft, etc. going anywhere anytime soon. And for that very reason I don't see anything wrong going all in on those stocks.

Once again, I'm talking LONG TERM (5+ years).

Bottom line is: pick a few tech stocks (trustworthy names such as Facebook, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Microsoft) OR pick a good tech ETF OR if you feel adventurous pick a leveraged ETF (NYSE:FANG+, FNGU, etc.) and forget about S&P500 and other sectors.

I'm interested in better understanding the maths behind the computation of the values of a given stock. Not ROI or anything related to investment strategies.

The stock market is a transaction based system, people buy and sell (with different mechanisms) and a stock value fluctuates based on those transactions.

Assuming that a stock is worth $100 when buying what is the mathematical process to compute the stock value after one transaction ? What are the parameters that are being considered ? 

I saw many things about evaluating the value of the stock for pre-IPO companies and I know that in some occasions actual people can do some arbitration on them but it seems very unlikely that this is not already automatized.

258,2021-05-17,nekqvi,StockMarket,"Hey Y'all!  
Below is a letter they had issued to their investors, as per the website 'Seeking Alpha'. Looks like someone more wants to be proved wrong!!  🚀  🚀  🚀

\*\*We took a small short position in GME (167 USD). We will continuously hedge the position to avoid being forced out at an inconvenient moment for an inappropriate reason.

The risk is that the market continues to value GME more like art, as to say there is no direct link to the capacity of generating earnings. It could be a symbol for the art of betting against the suits (that’s how many of these social media participants call Wallstreet’s elite). GME stands for the social media provoked short squeeze, like Kleenex for tissues, Zamboni for ice resurfacer, or Jakuzzi for a bubble bath. Any important influencers can restart the currently weakened spread of the narrative. Knowing this, other market participants might bet on exactly this occurrence and by their actions, increase the probability of it.

However, I believe that time runs against them. The spread of the narrative tends to weaken over time. There will be new exciting subjects in our fast-moving world.

The whole trade is based on masses trying to destabilize the offer and demand of the shares. There is no double cushion as to say that the holder benefits at one point from an intrinsic value in the form of dividends or liquidation (the trust of being able to perform both is often sufficient). This makes the trade very fragile during stressful market conditions.

We should not forget that GME is still a retail company that faces declining revenues due to the online streaming competition, a company that has been looking for a buyer for years. Of course, the 550 million USD that the company managed to raise will influence its odds, but does this justify a 10-billion USD difference outcome? Also to be noted is that the company lost several key people.

Many market participants have been caught on the wrong side of this trade. They will anticipate that this can happen again and take precautions. So, several significant hedge funds do not publish their short book on social media anymore to avoid becoming a target. Option sellers will increase the price of the concerned call options to make the trade less attractive.\*\*

This is a portion of some of my recent inflation DD from researching Michael Burry/Scion's recent 13F plays. I thought it was an interesting investing strategy and wanted to share it here in case anyone is interested. There's more research over on [r/Burryology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/) (specifically [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/nepc7l/the_bull_is_gasping_major_themes_from_michael/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)).

***Inflation, inflation, inflation! (21%+ of current holdings)***

If you've been following [r/Burryology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/) since its inception many eons ago (a little over a month ago), you likely guessed that the next 13F would reveal Burry's strategy for hedging and/or profiting off of the inflation situation. Would he buy/hold REITs as the hedge? What about gold, oil, and other commodities? Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS)?

We now have the answer.

Here are the direct inflation plays:

*Put options on* [***Ishares 20+ year treasury bond etf (TLT)***](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/031915/overview-tlt-etf.asp) *-* *12.7% of current holdings*

*Probable Burry thesis:* rising inflation over the mid- to long-term will lead to the need to increase interest rates thus making these 20 year bonds less attractive.

*Some context:* The U.S. Treasury announced plans to start issuing 20-year treasury bonds in January 2020. The benefits to 20 year treasury bonds are that they're relatively safe, their value could increase if interest rates drop, and they're relatively liquid. The cons are that they're over a 20 year period (meaning you lock in very low interest rates at which you get paid), inflation may occur over that 20 year period and lead to an increase in interest rates that you'll miss out on, and rising interest rates in general hurt the value of these bonds ([link](https://www.mybanktracker.com/blog/investing/20-year-treasury-bonds-307834)).

*Call options on* [*Proshares trust ultrashort lehment 20+ year treasury etf (TBT)*](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/TBT/profile) *- 4.1%*

Probable Burry thesis: this is the same 20+ year treasury bond mentioned above so the strategy is likely the same. The difference here is that it's a call on an inverse bond ETF.

*Context:* The ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses that correspond to two times the inverse of the daily performance of the ICE U.S. Treasury 20+ Year Bond Index. (from Zacks article linked above).

*Put options on Ishares* [russell 2000 growth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/russell2000.asp) *etf (IWO) - 3.1%*

*Probably Burry thesis:* There are two possibilities here. One is that the Russell 2000 is overpriced having outperformed the S&P 500 at 81% vs 43% since last May. The other is that inflation will lead to a recession that does actual damage to the economy which effectively makes a short on the Russell 2000 a bet against the overall economy.

*Context:* The Russell 2000 index measures the performance of the 2000 smaller companies that are included in the Russell 3000 index which itself is made up of nearly all U.S. stocks. It is seen as a bellwether of the American economy because it measures the performance of smaller businesses focused on the domestic market. It's considered more cyclical than the larger indexes which is to say that it follows the economy tightly.

*Others:*

1. *Shares of* *Proshares trust ultrashort lehment 20+ year treasury etf (TBT) - 0.5%*
2. *Call options on Proshares ultrapro short 20 + year t (TTT)*

***Out with the REITs***

One of the more interesting observations from Scion's Q4 2020 13F was a sleuth of positions in various REITs. He had a little over 17% of the portfolio in REITs:

* Uniti Group Inc - 3.98% (now 0%)
* The GEO Group Inc - 3.51% (now 0%)
* RPT Realty - 4.05% (now 0.5%)
* Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc - 2.81% (now 0.1%)
* CoreCivic Inc - 3.07% (overall net increase in the total position, now 0.7%)

In Q1 2021, REITs accounted for just 1.3% of Scion's holdings. He exited out of Uniti and GEO, trimmed Urstadt and RPT Realty, and increased the CoreCivic position. All-in-all, it seems he's bearish on REITs serving as the best vehicle for profiting off of inflation compared to shorting the 20 year treasury bond.",[],1
274,2021-05-17,nerkwg,StockMarket,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 17, 2021**

The market fell modestly on Monday, as concerns over rising inflation, marked by a higher than expected print in the April Consumer Price Index (CPI), continued. Technology stocks continued their volatility, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) going as low as 1.42% down intraday before recovering and closing 0.59% down. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.26% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed.

Stocks are coming into this week on the heels of an extremely choppy trading period recently, which saw the SPY pulling back 4% before recovering Thursday and Friday of last week after the April CPI and Producer Price Index (PPI) came in higher than expected. The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

The PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers have increased more than expected. Market participants are concerned that high levels of inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. 

While the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents. 

There are several factors, in my opinion, contributing to the rise of inflation. First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. 

Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. One prominent example you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt—incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs—recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, “Given the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying “Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.

275,2021-05-17,nerso1,StockMarket,"**Highlights:** 

BIGG is a blockchain technology company in the crypto space with two solutions: Netcoins, a crypto trading platform primarily targeting Canadian investors, and BitRank and QLUE, products designed to assess risk levels of crypto transactions, and trace transactions for forensic purposes. 

Netcoins reported $1.25M in revenue in February 2021, significantly surpassing Q3-2020 revenue of $643k. BIGG raised over $42M through multiple rounds of financing since the end of Q3-2020, and is currently in a strong cash position. 

The company’s current focus is to position itself as Canada’s leading regulated crypto trading platform. It has filed applications with regulators and is targeting approval for April 2021. Currently, Wealthsimple is the only regulated crypto trading platform in Canada, but it only offers bitcoin and ethereum trading. Major international players (i.e. Binance, Coinbase) are not currently regulated in Canada. 

Bitcoin prices have surged significantly in recent months (up 692% YoY), indicating rising investor appetite for cryptos. The global digital wallet user-base has been steadily increasing. In Canada, the Bitcoin ATM count was 874 at the end of 2020, up from just 58 in 2015. 

In 2021, Mastercard (NYSE: MA), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE: BK), JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) stated their intent to get into crypto offerings. 

With large institutional players entering the sector, and growing retail enthusiasm around cryptos, we believe the emphasis on risk and compliance will grow exponentially. Being one of the first movers, we believe BIGG is well positioned to capture this growth

**Company Overview**

BIGG is a Vancouver based company, with operational presence in the U.S. Currently, the company has two primary operating divisions:

1. Netcoins (primary revenue driver) – online cryptocurrency brokerage, positioning itself to be Canada’s regulated crypto trading platform (application filed for registration from the British Columbia Securities Commission / BCSC, and the Canadian Securities Administrators / CSA).

2. Blockchain Intelligence Group – focused on Anti-Money Laundering (AML), compliance, and other forensic services in the crypto sector using big data.

The company had an average QoQ revenue growth of 47% over the last five quarters. Per management guidance, Q4-2020 (ending December 31, 2020) and Q1-2021 revenues were $950k and $3.5M, respectively.

**Netcoins**

Netcoins was acquired by BIGG on August 1, 2019, for approximately $2.8M (paid in common shares). It has processed approximately $350M in transactions to date, with $178M in the first two months of 2021. It had reported monthly revenue of $1.25M in February 2021 (up 41% MoM, and 2,695% YoY). 

Revenue Model: Commission on trading is the primary revenue driver. Management noted the fee is in the 1% - 1.5% range. We note that this fee is higher than the spot trading rates of larger exchanges. For example, Binance’s fee starts from 0.10%, and Coinbase’s starts from 0.50%. However, management noted that Netcoins’ fee does not have any hidden fees (i.e. spreads), and is competitively priced. Given the recent surge in transaction volume on the platform, we believe users do not perceive Netcoins’ fee to be significantly higher than its alternatives. We believe Netcoins’ differentiating point vs larger international players is that it is integrated with the Canadian banking system. This feature is only provided by a handful of Canadian exchanges like Bitbuy, CoinSmart, Coinberry, etc.

Blockchain Intelligence Group (BIG) The company has disclosed multiple contracts with varied terms, adding up to $1.8M in revenue since 2018. We note that the average contract size is $191k/year.

The platform currently supports seven major currencies (BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, BSV, XRP, and XLM). Under BIG, there are two solutions that complement each other, discussed next: 

BitRank Verified™ BitRank provides users with a safety ranking (risk score) of the wallet involved in a crypto transaction. Risk profiling provides a simple to use safety score between 0 and 100; with 100 representing low risk, and 0 representing a very high-risk profile

This solution is focused on: 1. Complying with Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) standards. 2. Delivering transparency regarding the source and legitimacy of transactions 3. Providing users with confidence that transactions are not involved with, or implicated in criminal activities

Revenue Model: Up-front fee and a license fee (undisclosed); additional service charge for forensic investigation assistance, and other features. Target Client-base: Risk and credit management companies, financial institutions, ATMs, exchanges and investment platforms, government agencies, crypto-mining companies.",[],0

Given that shareholders will vote next week to merge with SOFI, it's the perfect catalyst for IPOE to have shorts squeeze this week. If we pass share price $17.50, $20.00, and $22.50, Market Makers(MMs) will need to buy 3.75 Million shares. This will give a big boost to the share price. This setup can only work this week only, with millions of new shares being added by SOFI merge, we might never get this chance. As the price rise, MMs will need to secure more shares to cover future contracts too.

Why is this an ideal setup?

1. short interest is rough 32%
2. the average volume is 3M so low volume.
3. On May 7, 2021, when the merge was announced the price jumped from 14.90 to 16.99 in a matter of minutes. Proving the low volume wall. This spike was caused by 2M(total Volume of the day: 5M) additional volume compare to 3M (last 3 months average volume). Just imagine what can 5M new volume can do here. During its prime, it traded around 20M per day.

Do your own research and be impressed. This is not stock advice, this is just my thought. I own shares and call in this Stock.

360,2021-05-18,nf4apu,StockMarket,"When I first heard about Forex trading around 2004, (this was before crypto trading existed) I was immediately intrigued and fascinated.  Every day, for what seems like endless hours, I caught myself daydreaming and thinking about the idea itself and wondering, “What does it really mean?” or “Does this shit really work?”  Let’s say in theory, a person gains some kind of skill or knowledge on how to outsmart the market and through this extraordinary skill, that person is then able to enter trades in what we are told is a global 6 trillion dollar liquid per day market (at that time it was 3 trillion) and be able to get profit from the trades.  Hopefully, the winning trades happen at least a higher percentage of time than the trades that don’t work out, right? And that’s reasonable to expect and doable by an average person, right?  (Ok.  Imagine going back in time to the point before you knew that almost know one ever achieves this and instead, enjoy the naivety and optimism you have for your newly discovered entrepreneurial project.)

Even a beginner can feel what it’s like to have a winning trade and that’s what gets us hooked on the addiction or in more positive terminology we could call it “motivation” or “passion” in Tony Robbins lingo. Yes, some would say it’s a delusional folly based on irrational exuberance. And if there is some special way to put the odds in your favor to have more winning than losing trades it seems like that would do the trick.  It seems like only a slight tweak or adjustment to most people’s trading strategies would activate the tipping point that puts them into the category of winning with consistent increase in capital.  I found plenty of reasons to be positive and optimistic about this project.  Later, I learned that some professionals had fewer winning trades than losing ones but the losing trades were really small and the winning trades were really big comparatively so it ends up creating a consistent increase in capital.  

Ok right.  I get it. But for me, I would prefer to actually know how to enter trades that win a high percentage of time in order to even feel like any increase would be legitimate.   I learned much later that even this belief is caused by unconscious core beliefs that limit success in trading but that’s a story for a later time. Still this desire for perfectionism, minimizing mistakes is part of what drove me to discover what works in trading. It has to be based on what I see is true about the market.  If I can see something is true and not base any trading strategy on something someone told me to do, then I know the probability is based on knowledge and skill and can be considered scientific to an extent. 

And then, the question arose, how much can a person make from trading?  This is a question that really enthralled me to the point of keeping me lying awake at night with wheels turning in my mind about how I would open my laptop for a few minutes at the beach, setting down my virgin margarita (limeade), and make a trade or two and seeing another $50,000 profit in my trading business, which of course, would be a simple easy and massively profitable enterprise. 

If the term “rude awakening” is appropriate for how to describe what actually happened later, that process was not a rude awakening of one day, it was drawn out over months and years of disappointment and struggle. But let’s not go there just yet because if this story leads to any discovery of a way to trade and actually get profit consistently, at least it has a happy ending and my sharing of ways to bypass the ridiculously excruciating trial and error that has happened along the way will be a way to really help a few people to not have to waste nearly as much time and money. 

The amount of wasted money on trading products like courses, software, and seminars has made me a bit of an activist on traders' consumer rights leading to expose some outright scams and deceptions that are so prevalent in the trading world especially in Forex and crypto. After a while, a person can spot the charlatons who have popped up in the Forex niche, people who have never traded successfully but are professional marketers who needed a “product” and were stumped about what to offer the “course junkies” and software addicts in this buying frenzied crowd of newbies as well as seasoned enthusiasts searching for some legitimate way to earn money from what is believed to be an honest skill like being a bricklayer, an architect, or chef. 

I have met many people who take up Forex trading in the hope of creating a part time side hustle income of something like an extra $1000 per month.  And let’s face it, most of us come from working class backgrounds and have a mindset of searching for some income that is enough to pay our living expenses. 

There is a HUGE problem with that idea.  If you believe you can earn consistent profit in trading and you intend to use that skill to make a thousand dollars and then AFTER you spend a few years gaining that skill, you use it by taking out your capital to make sure it never increases so that you limit yourself to ONLY getting $1000 per month, that would not make any sense.  If you ever do get this extraordinary skill you have gained the power to create an income of any amount and make as much wealth as you desire. Trading is not a side hustle.  If you master it you will become wealthy.  If you somehow force yourself to not allow your account to increase in any normal sensible way, it is possible to stop yourself from getting wealthy if you really want that. But that would be like owning a 5 star hotel but only allowing yourself to keep for yourself a receptionist’s salary. 

Not only would it never make sense for any trader who knows how to trade to use that skill to make one or two thousand dollars for paying bills, since we all unconsciously know that to be true it is the source of much of the inner conflicts that prevent traders from being able to trade.  If you don’t know by now, no matter what trading strategy you use and no matter how advanced your understanding of technical analysis is, the results that all traders get are mostly due to unconscious core beliefs.  If you’re not aware that’s true, try typing some keywords into Google and reading a book or two on personal development or psychology. Soon you will run into plenty of proof regarding that fact. 

Trading is not a hobby and not a part time side project.  If you master it, you are wealthy. Period. The unconscious limiting core beliefs that cause people to believe they can earn a couple of thousand dollars from trading and use it to pay their bills, keeps them from ever realizing any mastery in trading.  “Oh, but I don’t want to be one of those greedy rich people!”  This belief stops traders dead in their tracks from ever getting mastery of trading and because the conflict is *unconscious*, most will never know what the real problem is. 

**The Purpose or Intention of This Journey**

That’s what this story is about.  How to get to the bottom of whether there is a way to trade with a high enough probability and not fuck it up with psychological sabotage like suddenly feeling an anxiety attack that shuts off function of the frontal lobes of the brain while trying to remain calm and wise about trading decisions. And for the first step on this journey I have found that getting clear about your purpose for even going on this journey will help to form a clear map that you will create and/or discover for leading you to the goal of using your own knowledge and skill to earn consistent profit that will become any amount you can imagine.  If you succeed in mastering this skill, It’s just a matter of knowing how much time it will take for your account to increase to be the amount you want it to be. 

A valuable exercise to get you going is to get a notebook to use as a trading journal and another one to use as a personal development journal and write down your intention for what you hope to attain through learning to trade with excellence.  How will your life change when you have this skill you seek?  Will you use this skill to help others and participate in some form of philanthropy?  Do you have a mission that requires you to have this skill and this wealth that is for the benefit of others?  It’s ok if you just want to trade to get a dope car and impress girls, have sex and become a cocain addict for your mission. But chances are, if you begin to make contact with any part of yourself that has an intention to fulfill your real purpose, it might involve helping others in some way and maybe even doing something good for the world.  What's important is that before you do this you get clear about *why* you are doing it. People who give up in failure probably don’t know what their reason is for doing this in the first place. 

So to get started, take this step and be serious about it.  Write down why you want to learn to get profit consistently in trading and what you plan to do when that becomes a tangibly manifested reality of your life. No need to share anything on what you intend but being clear with yourself can help you to follow through with that intention.

541,2021-05-18,nfc239,StockMarket,"I noticed that most shares that rise rapidly (i.e. 10% or more on a given day) tends to go down the next day. I know that I can short many of these high volume ""rapid gainers"" from my trading account with very little fees.

I think that blindly shorting a ""rapid gainer"" is not a great idea because there are many reasons why a company has rapidly gained. Some may have risen in value because they announced a strategic partnership, or has new executives, etc. What should I look for? **I know that I should avoid 'chronic' reasons for gain, such as the announcement of a merger.**

Since the last outlook the price of ZKIN has increased by impressive 16% as it's being traded above psychological resistance at $5 per share.

The double bottom pattern seen a success! 

As the price broke trough the key resistance at $4.50 and broke through our break confirmation level at $4.55, extended gains to the next key resistance were being immediately seen!

The price action then took a deep breath and done a test, which would decide whether this rally can continue or this would be just another spike.

As the price found support at previous resistance at $4.50, the gains has continued to extend.

The price was then testing the key resistance at $4.80 for a while with a successful break in the end!

This successful break has quickly led the gains to $5.25 where it has found some resistance.

As of where the price action stands right now, we look for a retest of previous resistance at $4.80 to confirm it as a support before any further move to the upside.

Strong volume is present.

Indicators.

RSI has broke above 60, meaning that bullish momentum is present with no signs of slowing down or any bearish divergence.

MACD is in a really strong buying wave while the buying volume keeps increasing.

The overall short term trend has finnally changed into a strong uptrend. A break below $4.50 could change the trend back to downtrend. However this is pretty unlikely to happen.

As of writing this analysis, the price has found support at $4.80 and is ready to move higher!

808,2021-05-18,nfi2q5,StockMarket,"I’ve been doing really well and I feel like sharing my thoughts for anyone interested. These are the things I wish I had known which would have saved me a lot of setbacks.

Ignore the charts. Don’t even look at them when making a decision. Regardless of what anyone says. A chart will only tell you what has happened so far. It will never tell you what will happen next. There is one exception to this I have found but I will bring that up at the very end of this post.

Use critical thinking for any single piece of information you read about a company or the market. Who published it and why? I haven’t yet found (and probably never will find) a single news article or post with neutral information on a company. And it’s never going to happen. In the stock market there are many different players and they all have different motives. Don’t trust what a Reddit investor tells you. But also don’t trust what CNN or CNBC tell you. There is something called “bias” and you have to be able to adjust the weight you give to any information you receive based on how biased the information is or might be. Any time you get information check multiple sources. Never rely on one single source. Or even one single type of source. If you only trust major news outlets you will be mislead or worse be behind the curve. If you only trust what investing forums say you are likely to run into people who are bagholding and trying to pump the stock to be able to dump it for a higher price before it keeps tanking. The truth is somewhere in the middle. Do your own research and don’t hesitate to use Google’s “past 24 hour” search filter to make sure you’re getting the latest information.

Stay open to criticism. If you have a good idea but someone knows better, it’s not just a learning experience but it can save you from losing your money. However, only take criticism seriously if someone can properly articulate their point and isn’t just spouting catchphrases or being an asshole.

Dollar cost averaging. It’s better to make several buys into a stock than one giant buy. It’s impossible to perfectly time the market. But you will almost always get a better entry point by averaging than by throwing down all the chips on the first move.

Always do your own due diligence. If you can’t write a thesis explaining why you’re making an investment (that’s not only convincing but free of confirmation bias) then you probably shouldn’t invest. Don’t just research the company, research the market the company is in. If the company is poised to do well and corner the market but there isn’t much of a market in general then there is no future for the company. In addition, research the “target audience” not for the company but for the shares themselves. What type of investors are buying shares? Are they the opportunistic kind? Are they buying just for a quick profit to scalp before they dump the stock into oblivion, or are they buying because they see a future for the company and plan a long term hold? This can be true of institutional investors as well as retail. It’s a better sign (for now anyway) when a happy whale like Cathie buys shares banking on the future of a company than if a super-predator like Chamath is buying them for a quick flip. Always keep other investors in mind when you make a decision. Investors are the consumer that drives the price of a share.

Buy the dip but only if you have a good reason to! Don’t blindly buy every dip. I see that pushed too often on Reddit. Buying a dip is good if a company is on an upwards trend and the dip occurred randomly. Do NOT buy the dip if it’s part of a larger downtrend or if it’s possibly due to an overall change in sentiment. Worst case scenario you will multiply your loss and best case scenario you will tie up further capital on a loser which results in decreased ammunition if you suddenly find a winner. Your $500 you could have used to buy a gainer will now be $300 you can use to buy another stock.

Don’t ever hesitate to cut your losses. If a company is in a downwards trend and it looks like they will be for a while (and there is no catalyst around the corner) cut the loss. Put your money in a better place. But keep watching the ticker. You can always buy back in when the sentiment turns positive. Keep a watchlist of stocks that look promising but don’t make it so big that you lose oversight and don’t make it so small that you’re missing too many opportunities.

Gauge your performance by your method and not by your gains and losses. If you’re up 100%, be honest with yourself. Are you up because you got lucky or because you have a solid strategy? If you’re down 40%, was it because of unpredictable factors or was it your own fault because you bought due to fear of missing out which clouded your thinking? Never beat yourself up. Learn from every move you make. Remember it’s impossible to perfectly time anything. If you sold and secured a 10% gain but it could have been 15%, that’s normal. You’re never going to catch the top of a spike or the bottom of a dip. That’s like waiting in the ocean for the perfect wave. It won’t happen and you’ll drown unless you’ve learned to surf when the wave gets to you. Same with buying. Most of the time when you buy, the stock will move down. I’ve lost a small percentage at the start of almost all my well planned and well timed moves. I kept holding and the losses turned into significant gains.

Manage risk and reward. The higher the risk, the lower percentage of your profile you should put into it. Be psychologically prepared to lose everything. The more you’re willing to live with that possibility, the more you’re going to be able to keep a cool mind when taking a calculated risk.

Never stop learning. The more you know, the more of an edge you have. Get in the habit of reading several articles per day. Focus on your existing investments so you can learn how what type of news affects the markets in which ways.

Never stop looking for opportunities. They don’t come to you. You have to find them like a needle in a haystack or a diamond in the rough. You’ll get much better at finding them with time. If you don’t get good at looking for opportunities and evaluating them then you won’t have any opportunities.

Never buy in to hype. The more hyped a stock is, the more likely it is that it will tank later. Even if you find a promising company for a good long term investment, wait until the hype dies down and the share price goes down. Otherwise you’ll start your investment with a slow and steady loss.

Shares are priced based on supply and demand. There are bids and there are asks. The higher the demand is on shares the higher the bids will be. The lower the demand is on a share the lower the bids will be. What this means is that when there is more buying pressure than selling pressure the cost of a share goes up. When there is more selling pressure than buying pressure the cost of a share goes down. In fact, that is all a chart will really tell you. Think of a chart as a historical look at past buying and selling pressure. Nothing more and nothing less. The price direction is determined only by buying and selling pressure.

The value of a share is subjective. You can run any equation you want to but there is no equation which links any of the variables of a company to the price of a share. There are many different ways to “value” stocks. DDM, DCF, price to earnings, price to book, enterprise value to EBIDTA, Technicals...and they all mean nothing. Why? Because the value of a share is what people are willing to pay for it. A stock is no different than a consumer good. Take, for example, iPhone. If you compare the iPhone 12 to android phones with similar specs the iPhone 12 price tag more than doubles some lesser known brands with the same specs. But people are willing to pay more for the iPhone. So the iPhone costs more. The value of a share is the same. If people are willing to pay more for a share of a company then those shares will cost more even if there is no mathematically verifiable reason.

There is no formula based on the specs of a phone which will predict what the retail cost of the device will be. Just like there is no formula which will take any company metrics into account and determine the price of a share.

Stocks go up and stocks go down. Everyone hates red days. But they’re normal and they’re not a sign you’re doing something wrong. They mostly move when there are catalysts that have either positive or negative effects on sentiment. The rest of the time they will trade sideways or slightly downwards. As long as the slope isn’t steep and there have been no bad news about the company having a red day is fine. In fact if a stock was only green all the time I would probably sell it because that could be a good sign it’s in a bubble and bubbles are known for bursting.

The biggest gains and losses in the market are driven by the biggest changes in investor sentiment. And investor sentiment isn’t rational. It’s irrational. For example there could be some slight bad news about a company which will have no bearing on the bottom line (for example a brief delay in a crucial step) which hits a nerve and causes an emotional overreaction which causes the stock to tank. Or there could be some neutral news about a company which investors mistakenly perceive as positive causing the stock to skyrocket.

Catalysts don’t matter. People’s reactions to the catalysts matter. If you look into a company that has upcoming catalysts, don’t focus on how the catalysts will effect the bottom line for the company. Focus on how the catalysts will impact investor sentiment. For example, if a company decides to increase the cost of a pharmaceutical product and they are now going to make 12 billion more dollars over the next 5 years, that’s great for the company. But if people are upset and there is bad publicity like “My mother died because she couldn’t afford her diabetes medication after the price hike.” then the value of a share will go down.

The biggest gains are in speculative investing but they also carry the highest risk. The reason that speculation has the biggest potential for gains is strictly due to human psychology. Investors are going to be a lot more fearful to invest in a company which isn’t generating revenue or where the future of a company has no proven results to back it up. Even if that company is going to cure cancer. But that’s also why there is the potential for a huge reward. If you can find a company investors are fearful to invest in now and you have enough data about the company to conclude that they are going to be successful, then you can actually turn a speculation into a somewhat more secure investment. 

For example, if a company announces that they found a cure for alzheimer’s. And you just happen to be a neuroscientist. If you understand the science and you instantly realize that they have a disruptive breakthrough, you can now use that to your advantage. You can invest in the company now with the knowledge that the science is solid. This gives you an edge. You know that you know the company will be a success. But you also know that anyone who isn’t a neuroscientist will have little faith in the company. As a result, you have now found a company which is setup for a massive change in sentiment. So you buy 10,000 shares for $0.03. Eventually, the company moves through to phase 3 clinical trials and the product gets approved. The news headlines hit that a company cured alzheimers. Now the shares you bought for $0.03 are suddenly worth $15. Your degree in neuroscience just paid off better than your actual day job as a neuroscientist. As the stock keeps trending upwards the $300 you spent is now $150,000. This gain is mostly attributable to using your existing knowledge to get ahead of a pivot in investor sentiment.

Use what you know. Just like the example above. Everyone has areas they are more or less knowledgeable about. If you know a lot about technology, focus on technology stocks. If you are a geologist, focus on mining stocks. Anyone can have an advantage. Even if you’re working at a deadbeat job and you get a free sample for an air freshener that finally actually gets rid of the smell of stale cigarettes in your well used car, invest in that air freshener. Any single piece of knowledge you have about any single thing can be used to your advantage to make a trade.

Which company evaluations actually do matter? Is the company going to be able to survive? That’s the main thing I’ve been looking at with my speculations. A company could have come out with a technological breakthrough. But do they have the funding or an existing revenue stream to carry it out? Are they going to be consumed by debt and implode or are they getting funding in one way or another? Another important one is if another company will buy them out. If a company has mediocre performance and is going to be bought out by Microsoft that can be great for your investment. But if a company has a breakthrough, doesn’t have the resources to commercialize it themselves and has to give in to the highest bidder for a buyout then the upside to your investment is going to be a lot more limited.

Those are really the only company metrics I’m focused on.

Stay up to date on your investments. Don’t just look at your portfolio once a month and complain about it going up or down. Is your chart going up? Find out why. Is your chart going down? Find out why.

Stay ahead of the news! If it’s 5am and you have to get up for work, get in the habit of quickly checking the news on your tickers so that you can stay on top of any changes. The sooner you know bad news came out the more likely it is you will be able to hit the sell button before anyone else does. If you have tickers you’re watching, try to buy in the moment there is good news or in advance of the good news. Especially if the sentiment is positive.

Be careful with stop losses. If you don’t know what a stop loss is, it basically means that you have set up your purchase so that your broker will sell your shares for you if they dip below a certain amount. They can be great for risk management but they can also screw you over. If you bought a company for $10 and you have a stop loss at $8 you won’t be happy when it dips to $7.50 before shooting up to $20. Because now your stop loss actually worked against you. You lost a +100% gain and you secured a loss. Another time stop losses can be unhelpful is if your stock is trading on a foreign exchange as well. For example, if you have a stock on the NASDAQ trading for $10 and a stop loss for $9 but it also trades on a European exchange. It the stock closes at $10 but tanks overnight and trading opens at $5 on the NASDAQ, your stop loss will have done nothing. Even worse, it’s possible your stop loss won’t be triggered at all now because the system won’t pull the trigger while the price of the shares continues to drop.

Market buys, market sells, limit buys and limit sells. I see a lot of confusion about this online and quite a few people get limit orders mixed up with the bid-ask spread. Small fish investors like retail have nothing to do with the bid-ask spread. When you place a market buy order through your broker you are agreeing to purchase a set number of shares at the current market price. I never use market orders. Why? Because if you execute a market buy or a market sell and the price of the security changes rapidly it won’t fill at all. And in order to cancel it and place a new order you first have to find it, then cancel it and then place a new order. I always use limit orders. If I’m buying shares and the cost looks like it’s on an upwards trend I will always place a limit buy for a price quite a bit higher than the current market value. Some people seem to think you won’t get the best price possible that way but this is wrong. If a stock is trading for $8 and you put in a limit buy for $8.50 but the stock only goes up to $8.10 your broker will fill it at $8.10. If I’m buying shares and the cost of the security looks like it’s currently on a downwards trend I will place a limit buy just a bit above what I think it will drop down to. That way I don’t have to stare at the chart all day and I can check throughout the day and place a new order if the direction changed and it didn’t fall below that point yet. As far as selling goes I will always place limit orders as well to guarantee the trade goes through instead of putting faith in a lack of volatility and risking the sell not going through. If the stock is going down I will place a limit sell for a lower price. If the stock is going up I will place a limit sell for a higher price. I won’t make them too much higher or too much lower though because this is the opposite of buying and I don’t want the stock to get stuck to my hands when I’m trying to dump it.

Since investor sentiment drives the price of shares, wouldn’t it be nice if there was a single quick way to gauge the current investor sentiment towards a company? As it turns out, you can! And you can do it really quickly by eyeballing a chart even if you don’t have a clue what you’re doing. Here’s how. Take a look at the chart. Focus on points in the chart where there have been sudden upwards and sudden downwards movements. And look at what happens following those movements.

If the stock dropped 12% due to some bad news, what happens next? Does it stay down or does it climb back up? The quicker it climbs back up out of a dip, the more positive investor sentiment is.

If the stock jumped up 12% due to some good news, what happens next? Does it stay up and slowly keep rising or does it tank back down to levels even lower than before the spike? The quicker it drops back down after a spike, the more negative investor sentiment is.

Keep in mind though that investor sentiment can change and just because there has been overall positive or negative sentiment in the past does not mean that the sentiment will continue. Check news for any updates on the company. Make sure nothing is in the works that could cause the sentiment to change to the negative when you are buying in. Check stock message boards. Check financial news. Use your brokers news feed, they are often quicker to the punch.

It’s definitely more profitable to buy something that has overall positive sentiment.",[],0

934,2021-05-18,nflc5f,StockMarket,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 18, 2021**

Stocks held steady today, with the three major indexes trading within a 0.5% range of the even line. It’s encouraging to see the market holding steady after the volatility experienced in the last few weeks. As I have said before, I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, where technology stocks sank and the S&P 500 (SPY) fell 4%, was overblown for a few reasons that will be explained below. 

Last week, the market tumbled in the largest loss since February after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the April Consumer and Producer Price indexes, which showed a larger increase than expected.  The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

The PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year.

While it’s difficult to pinpoint exact causes, there seem to be several factors contributing to the rise in inflation, none of which I think pose a significant threat to the sustainability of the current bull market.  First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. 

Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. As basic economics shows us, when demand begins to outstrip production capabilities (aka supply), prices inevitably go up. One prominent example of this you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. 

Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt—incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs—recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, “Given the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying “Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.

Now that we understand why inflation may be rising, these are the reasons I think fears are overblown. With the US economy reopening, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Moreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy.

     Can someone explain how inflation will be “transitory” (As J-Powell has referenced)? 

     I can see how the exorbitant prices of raw materials will come down as global supply chain bottlenecks eventually resolve themselves, but when has a consumer business (such as a restaurant) ever taken back an increase in menu prices? 

     I tend to side with the fed regarding the outlook on inflation in the near future. I don’t believe we will see a level of inflation that will decimate our economy and render the dollar worthless. However, I do expect higher levels of inflation than normal. And I’m not too sure about Powell’s comments that inflation is on track to mildly exceed 2%. I think it will be a bit higher than that.

     What do you make of Powell’s comment and what is your outlook for 2021?",[],0
