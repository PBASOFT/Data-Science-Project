63,2021-05-27,stocks," Hi everyone,

I'm new on the stockmarket, I'm a novice and not a professional investor, nor do I work in the field.  
I decided to try my hand at trading partly for fun and ofcourse to make a bit extra if I can.

The thing I'm struggling with the most is how to determine what stocks to buy.  
You often see stocks suddenly soar (like AMC atm), or suddenly plummet, but how do you ""predict"" this? I've messed around in some smaller stocks a bit, starting with 100 usd just to try, and on all the trades I made ( I tried 4 over 4 days) I lost money.

Is it just an experience thing? Should I keep trying until I recognize patterns? Are there websites/magazines/whatever I should keep an eye on? Should I religously be checking this reddit?  
Any help would honestly be much MUCH appreciated.

Thanks alot in advance!",nmi6dt,['AMC'],0

154,2021-05-27,stocks,"Is there a way to know what the distribution of shares being held at various prices?

For example for some random stock with 10 million total shares the data i would like to know is below.

I would like to see how many stocks are purchased and are held at various price points, so i can see the distribution.

|Random Stock: ABCDEF - Current Price $65||
|:-|:-|
|Shares|Cost|
|1million|$10|
|4million|$20|
|4million|$30|
|1million|$60|

Why? I think analyzing the distribution and the change in distribution can provide some interesting investing information.

&#x200B;

For example.  Another imaginary stock and different distribution

&#x200B;

|Random Stock: ABCDEF2 - Current Price $65||
|:-|:-|
|Shares|Cost|
|0.5million|$5|
|0.5million|$10|
|3million|$50|
|6million|$60|

&#x200B;

The data between first one and second one paints a different picture.

It could be a way to identify pump and dumps, solid growth stocks, hot new stocks, and everything else.

I would like to figure out what i can figure out.  I just need the data.

So...... is this data available?  I am making sense? Is this being done already by hedge funds?

Thanks for reading",nmixsv,[],1

180,2021-05-27,stocks,"So to get this out of the way, Iâ€™m new to trading stocks, and I decided on Stash due to a recommendation from a friend. 

What is concerning me now is the influx of negative reviews on Stash. Some people are claiming that theyâ€™re preventing them from transferring stocks, withdrawing money, selling stocks, closing their account, and charging them after they closed their account. 

What steps could I take to prevent running into these issues? 

Iâ€™m already considering transferring my assets, but thereâ€™s a $75 dollar fee for doing so. Plus some reviews mention certain stocks not being transferred.

And before the keyboard warriors come out, if youâ€™re going to insult me make it constructive, or at least funny.

247,2021-05-27,stocks,"Hi,

I am noticing some strange $KHC option flow lately, largely what appears to be bearish. Flow seems to indicate large amounts of selling calls for July 16th, 2021 and Jan 21 2022 with strike prices ranging from 30-37.5 and 20-30, respectively. 

At the same time, there are buys (of calls)  for same time frames for the same expiry's above with strike prices ranging from 35-37.5 and 14-24, respectively.

Can anyone explain to me the likely strategy of this order flow? It seems bearish, based on volume and premiums paid out for the selling of calls, versus the buying of calls. I am unsure if I am missing something? 

TIA!",nmjipy,[],0

My fellow deviants miscreants and other opportunists 


GOED is some company that just jacked their existing shareholders. This was done in the form of a public offering which obliterated anyone already invested 

The last I looked, itâ€™s down 69% after hours 

They closed at 6 and priced the offering at like 2 or some utter bullshit lol, I will be looking to swoop in like a vulture scoop some up and sell off on a bounce

The trashier the stock the more itâ€™s ripping.  AMC, GME, RIDE, SOS, BB, etc. etc.  Even the scammy EVâ€™s like NKLA was up like 15% today.  My theory on this is that short interest is pulling out of these garbage stocks for some reason (I refuse to believe anyone is actually buying NKLA).  Iâ€™ve heard before that something that often happens right before a crash is market short interest goes way down.  Itâ€™s one reason crashes are sometimes so bad, there are less shorts to cover a decline.  Anyone else got a theory on why this is happen or concerned about it ?",nmlyqb,"['GME', 'AMC', 'RIDE']",0

I can sell the rights now online through my broker.  Or I can call them to exercise, before 6/22.

GLQ is about 5% of my account.

What NAV is used to determine the price I'd pay?  Whatever it is on 6/22?

646,2021-05-28,stocks,"Closing on a home in June. Need to sell some stocks and trying to decide which ones.

We have Google and Amazon from 2013 which have been our biggest returns but I think we should hold considering those are two of the biggest companies right now.

We also have some stock we bought in February in anticipation of travel opening back up - United Airlines, Carnival, and Disney. 

UA and Carnival have had positive returns. Surprisingly (to me) Disney has not. 

We play the long game with these and originally planned on holding on to Disney for awhile and I am stubborn enough to not want to sell at a loss.

My wife also has some stocks in US real estate. We were originally going to hold on to this bc of the market (it's given us positive gains) but then thought about it and think it might've peaked.

We also have US emerging markets and European emerging markets. Neither of which I know much about...my wife invested in those but they have also had a positive gain.

We have had other losses too...those were long term stocks we decided to sell bc there wasn't any net return.

Any advice on which ones to sell? I am thinking Disney, as hard as it is to sell after less than six months, and US real estate.

TLDR: need some advice on what to sell to help with a home purchase. Leaning towards Disney and US real estate. Help! Don't want sellers remorse...",nmmgod,[],1

I bought AMC at 10 some 2 weeks ago, and now it seems the price is getting skyrocketed (now at 26) by pretty much the same type of operation than for GameStop, which I understand is ''Meme stock''.

I'm seeing this as very good, of course, but I feel like this whole GameStop situation was a one-time thing, so who knows. With that, what should I wait and look for? Is it possible to see those stocks skyrock? Is the general consensus is that it's going to fail?

988,2021-05-28,stocks,"I put money into my roth IRA this year but it looks like I will be over the income limit. 

My understanding is that I owe 6% on principle but even if I fix the issue before the end of the tax year, I will still get hit with the 10% early withdrawal fee.

Is there a way to withdraw the money from the IRA before the end of the year and not get hit with the 6% or 10% fee?

I believe the money was contributed to the roth IRA in March 2021 and I purchased $6000 of VTI which was blended with my previous IRA contribution. Which means the contribution has appreciated so I don't even know how much to withdraw, especially since I have dividends reinvesting. 

Any insight?",nmp2qy,[],0
