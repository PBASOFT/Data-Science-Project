 If a long enough time passes, yup we’ll have inflation. But this whole “what will the Fed do?!” Seems scripted. 
Its been a headliner for months with no data backing tht “worry” narrative until the latest CPI. Then the market sold off. 
Followed by the recent swing up in tech stocks.. the stocks WS was pushing retail investors to rotate out of. 

The FRB has been saying the same thing for months. But the “journalists” KEEP asking “wht about infkation worries?” until Powell or Yellen say tht if the economy moves  too quickly they will act. 


“On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also noted “a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. 

However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. 

Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ngcedr/can_anyone_explain_why_earnings_no_longer_matter/

I really don't understand this shit.

All the time now, a company performs well and the stock price drops because of it. Take Lowe's today for example. It blasted earnings. It literally doubled them. 8th earnings in a row it has smashed, and today it's down. Literally, you have a company coining it in, and the share price is dropping. (I dont own it btw, so this isn't a rant on that basis)

I know the argument is ""ThE WhoLE MaRkEt Is DoWn"". Sorry, no, I don't buy this bullshit.

Let's look at todays winners;

Advaxis is the 2nd biggest gainer today and is up 21%. It's a garbage fucking pennystock that trades at 0.58 cents. Even worse, it's a bullshit pharma stock. Normal volume is 6 million. Volume today - 166 million. There is no news to justify this interest

Mosys is the big winner so far, up 33%. Another bullshit $5 stock. Normal volume is 2 mil. No news, but today the volume is 30x the norm.

LifeMD has had lawsuits filed against it today, about claims its directors have comitted fraud. Even better;

LifeMD appears to use unlicensed doctors to dispense OTC medications, has implemented an autoshipping/autobilling scheme, failed to honor guarantees, and put in place abusive telemarketing practices.

So what does the stock do in response to this? Of course, it jumps 12%.

To end my rant, the 3rd placed highest today is another bullshit company, a Chinese medical company called Lianluo Smart. There's one single news article linking it to a takeover by newegg or something, the news article made little sense. Low and behold, normal volume is 400k, today it's 9 million. Even if the news is to be believed, this one single article was posted 1 hour ago, yet the price suddenly spiked 2 hours ago.

So, why do companies that do well, make money, smash earnings lose their stock value, and bullshit, nonsense companies get P&D so much. This is a daily occurance. Every single day I see a new company increasing its share price by 50%+ and it's nonsense. I thought P&D's were illegal.

I'm losing (lost tbh) all faith in the market and it feels more and more like a (rigged) casino every day now.",[],0

They say in a market panic, all correlations go to 1.

Small cap, large cap, growth, value, emerging markets, industrial, raw materials, energy, consumer cyclicals and even some non cyclicals. It’s like all correlations collapsed into 1... and the market panicked *upwards*. The two asset classes that didn’t show this trend: long term bonds and real estate. The former, obviously I think, because with rates so low and money flowing in, everyone realized that fixed income would basically be losing money. The latter, for a number of reasons related to the pandemic, including low interest rates, people trying to buy hard assets to beat inflation, and of course city renters who could now work from home and wanted more space.

Crypto also went off on a weird pattern, but I think that was due to a true bubble frenzy in that market made by folks getting govt checks and storing them somewhere “safe”.

The result is an absolutely inflated stock market, and a kind of Mexican standoff where nobody wants to bag hold but nobody wants to move into a different asset class for fear of more inflation.

Some people don't know, so get off your high horses and help the guy out for God sakes. 

It looks like you're trying to turn a small amount of money into a decent amount of money by the way you set up your positions. 

The problem with penny stocks, is that it is extremely difficult to find one that isn't priced based on rumors (which means it'll eventually die down) and has some actual value. Finding a 2-10x bagger is very rare but it does happen. 

Theres an entire industry of information to learn,, however, if youre looking to play around with smallish amounts of money and hit a home run on a penny stock,, then....

Find 2-3 companies that are TRULY undervalued (that's a can of worms in itself)
Vet everything about the company, the management, the numbers,, it's prospects, potential catalysts,, etc. 
If youre comfortable that the play is extremely undervalued and that once people catch on and volume comes in, it'll sprint, then invest. 

A penny stock could take a very long time, but if you do your due diligence, you could strike gold. 

Put in small amounts of money on a weekly basis into 2-3 penny stocks that you have serious conviction about. 

Wait 6 months - 5 years and you might just get rich. Some of these do 100x at some point in time. Just remember to always challenge your belief about a company and its valuation. 

If new information presents itself and you no longer believe. Get out and try again. 

Otherwise, learn other methods of investing.

Good luck!",[],0

Some cryptos secure other things than transactions, this is a very handy way of saving information in an extremely sturdy and reliable way.

638,gyxu6v5,2021-05-21,t3_nho5kv,StockMarket,"If you're talking long term:

BTC and ETH are likely to be worth zero in several years.   Why?  These are early adopter technologies.   BTC in particular has severe transaction limits as it's currently constituted, with a limit of \~4.6 transactions per second \*world wide\*.   Plus it's slow.   So you'll never see BTC in it's present form become the currency of the future.   It has too many technical limits.  

Ethereum is better, but it's still got issues that will need to be fixed long term.   

I'm not going to argue that cryptocurrency isn't going to be the future.   But you're investing in coins that only have a value today because it's the best thing that we've come up so far.  This industry is so young that putting any large chunk of money in them with the thought that it's a ""long term hold"" isn't really looking at how these technologies work.

I'm also a big fan of broad market index funds.   Before you decide the rest of your portofolio is your long term strategy you owe it to yourself to explore the wiki at [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting\_started](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started) and understand the strengths of that methodology in comparison to yours.",[],0
639,gyxu7hp,2021-05-21,t3_nho5kv,StockMarket,"I’m no expert but my way of investing is sort of like this. %50 of portfolio in a solid ETF. You shouldn’t hold multiple ETFs one or two and search for ETFs that tailor to portfolios with stocks/markets you really like and look for low management fees, fortunately there’s a lot of great ETFs out their. I’d say another 20% of your portfolio into crypto, and another 20% dedicated to stocks you love, have great fundamentals, and believe in for the future. (Many aspects to this as it’s tailored to your taste, market focus, market sector etc). The remaining 10% you can use for more risky stocks and buy that I mean day trading/swing trading, options etc to make more money if you like to trade, important note, if you’re not into trading this part (last %10) is irrelevant and you can put it in an S&P or something. You can obviously play with the numbers and percentages but I personally like to go this route of a portfolio.

Important piece here is ETFs as others mentioned. “Professional Investors” rarely if ever beat the market or an ETF on overall returns. Stay away from mutual funds they’re shit, fees are always so high and they rarely outperform the market or an ETF, and a lot of them have your funds locked in for a period of time.

But to be quite honest, building your portfolio is totally tailored to your liking. Take suggestions from how others build their portfolio and customize your to one the fits you.

In America, we take stable currency and access to cheap debt for granted. DXY has dropped 10% in the last 12 months and people are terrified. We are appalled by 20% interest on credit card debt. 

In developing nations, say Nigeria and Venezuela, their currencies deal with double digit inflation rates. In the last 15 years, Nigeria’s currency has lost over 95% of its value compared to the dollar. Because of this, banks charge exorbitant interest rates in the 50%, 75%, 100% range. 

So it’s understandable that over half of Nigerians own some cryptocurrency, and that they gravitate towards decentralized lending rather than going through their own banks.

1. Warren Buffet and Jack Bogle recommend this. 

2. Most if not all of the s&p 500 companies are also international companies so what is the point in investing in international etfs or emerging market when US companies have business there? 

I think this is a good place to start for you as you develops your skills and knowledge. 

I started investing in the s&p which I still do in my 401k but I mainly focus in dividend growth investing and own a portfolio of 13 stocks.  If I where not doing single stocks I would be doing SCHD etf. 

I arrive to that conclusion after 3 years of reading and research. So my advice start with the s&p and buy some time for you to keep on learning.

742,gyxzlvz,2021-05-21,t1_gyxvmeh,StockMarket,"Umm, I think you misunderstand currency then.

By definition currency is a store of value.   If you have a dollar bill it's ""storage"" for a dollar.

Yes, bitcoin is currently storing value.  But there is absolutely no value in those bitcoins if people decide to use a different technology instead of bitcoin.  A somewhat simplified view of what you're buying with bitcoin is a share of the mathematical work that has been done to 'mine' those coins.   However, if that mathematical work no longer has value since people have moved onto Etherum or whatever the next coin is then your purchased Bitcoins won't have value.   

The point I was making is that there are restrictions in the current implementation of Bitcoin which make it technically unattractive for many reasons.   There is a reason why Etherum is gaining more and more traction in real-world applications.  

So if you're looking for a 'buy X and ignore for 20 years' investment, bitcoin is definitely not it.   Which is the point I was making - you're investing in a 'currency' or 'value store' which may or may not have any value in the future.",[],0

* Too little cash. 2% gives you no wiggle room, I'm aiming for more like 10% with valuations as high as right now. (I took it as a given that your emergency funds are not included).
* Too much crypto. I probably wouldn't be able - nor would I want - to dissuade you from going heavy in on cryptos if you believe so much in it, but the risks associated with this whole market and your exact picks are very high. It's a high risk - high reward game, personally I wouldn't be comfortable with anything more than 5-10%, and even that is a stretch (I have something like 3-4% total in BTC and ETH).
* Too little exposure to emerging markets. I like it between 10 and 30% of my equity basket, so if you aim for 70% equity, you should have 7-21% of your total portfolio in EM. I would say a good 10% is warranted.

752,gyxzwe6,2021-05-21,t3_nh9k5i,StockMarket,"Broker app Trade Republic Bank GmbH, founded by former Merrill Lynch banker Christian Hecker, has become one of Germany’s biggest fintech firms by valuation.


The Berlin-based company finished a $900 million financing round with investors including Sequoia, TCV, Thrive Capital, and Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, it said in a statement on Thursday. The round valued Trade Republic at more than $5 billion.

Trade Republic lets customers trade stocks, ETFs, crypto currencies and other financial products on its app, mostly without order commissions or other fees. It was founded in Germany in 2015 and has recently expanded into Austria and France. Hecker told Bloomberg earlier this month the company is looking to offer its services all over Europe.

Today’s funding round followed a 62-million-euro ($75.5 million) round last year that had already turned Trade Republic into one of the highest valued startups in Germany, next to smartphone bank N26.

Late last year, N26 was considering a fresh fundraising at a valuation above $3.5 billion, while early this year Berlin-based banking platform provider Mambu raised 110 million euros at a 1.7 billion euros ($2.1 billion) valuation.




The funding is also a glimmer of success for Germany’s fintech industry, after the high-profile collapse of payment firm Wirecard.



“We expect the company to break even in 2022 and achieve strong margin growth thereafter,” said Marius Fuhrberg, analyst at German financial services firm M.M. Warburg.
Brokerage houses from Germany, U.K., France and Denmark reported a surge in retail trading during the pandemic. However, startups such as U.S. rival platform Robinhood Markets Inc., which is planning to reveal filings for its initial public offering, have seen order volumes surge thanks to their low-cost model.

Traditional brokers finance themselves through fees and rebates from trading venues. New challengers, like Trade Republic and Robinhood, receive revenue from “payment for order flow,” a system where market makers like Citadel Securities pay retail brokers for routing orders to them.
“Don’t really box this company into one of those ready for an exit, it is a very young company that has a lot to do before thinking about anything,” said Luca Bocchio, a partner at Accel who sits on Trade Republic’s board. He added that he expects Trade Republic to focus on growth over profitability. “In a way monetization, it is not yet the most important variable I would consider,” he added.
According to Hecker, 31, who previously worked within the investment banking unit at Merrill Lynch, the rebates alone are enough for Trade Republic to be able to earn money. Trade Republic declined to comment on their revenue. Robinhood received about $331 million in the first quarter from payments for order flow, up from $91 million a year ago.
”We are currently consciously accepting losses in order to be able to grow quickly,” Hecker said in an interview.",[],1

* Dividends aren't useful for anything other than psychology. When you receive a dividend, the stock price falls by the amount of the dividend. It's really just a forced early withdrawal of value from the stock. If you're just going to reinvest it immediately then it's pointless.

* You don't really need a slice for emerging markets since you already have exposure to that space through VWRL.

* You're heavily tilted towards growth stocks. Consider adding some value exposure. Value stocks have underperformed in recent decades, but that won't always be the case. Value stocks have been crushing growth for the last 6 months, for example. QQQ and SPY already give good growth exposure, so consider switching that growth stock slice into a value stock slice, unless that's you're stock picking slice or something like that.",[],1

I think you probably need to spend some time here:

[https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting\_started](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started)

That will help  you understand why everyone is just pushing you toward holding a S&P fund, although many people have moved on from a S&P fund to VTI which holds not only the S&P 500 but the rest of the USA, so you are also covered if small/medium businesses do well.    And often people add VXUS in case international does better than the US.   Or if they're lazy they just by VT which does it all.

The whole boglehead philosophy is to hold as much of the world stock market as possible so you're diversified as much as possible so no matter what does well, you're still growing.   The S&P 500 advice is based on the fact that it is an easy thing to explain to many, S&P 500 funds are widely available in most retirement accounts, and so on.",[],1

912,gyyed29,2021-05-21,t1_gyyd5vh,StockMarket,"Easy!
With the strategy I use, do not set your stop loss more than 10% from buy point. First step is to figure out your break even point and prifit secure points. take profits or protect from loss at that point. 

Maybe when the stock gains 10%, secure your profits or  protect from loss, or when the stock k advances to at least 3x your risk, take profits or secure from loss. 

Example: buying stock at $50 and taking a 5% risk makes stop-loss at $47.50 ($2.50 risk)

If the stock advances $57.50, (3×$2.50) move stop loss to at least $50 or take profits etc. 

The strategy I like to use is to secure from loss and incrementally move stop loss up when I see the opportunity on a weekly time frame of the chart.
