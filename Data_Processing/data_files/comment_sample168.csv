For instance if you have 100k, making 1 or 2% in a few weeks with a couple hours of researching picks is a massive gain, and still within reasonable tax implications. If you make 1% on 100 bucks for that same effort you aren't going to be taxed but you literally made 1 dollar for a few hours of work. Absolute waste of time. On the flip side if you have a million bucks, a small % loss is a ton of money, and not simply something you can easily get back with a day job. Small gains also carry with them significant tax implications at higher brackets, to where trading can really screw you and not be worth the effort compared to investing.",[],0

Yes robinhood will almost certainly pull more shenanigans during the squeeze. Their paymaster is citadel after all. I feel bad for those who dont and cant move to another broker. Thousands of customers have already transferred to fidelity alone.

Not hoping there is more than enough evidence if you actually look for it. You raise a good point about the rules being changed. Recently a number of regualtory changes  have been passed by the SEC which paint a powetful picture of whats to come. Google OCC-004 and OCC- 003 , if only for curiosity  Or dont, the choice is yours. 

The SEC /DTCC are preparing for a nuclear bomb and are battening down the hatches in order to isolate the damage and reduce a wider negative market impact.

My point is that this is much bigger than you realise. This is why it is so hard for people to get onboard as the whole scenario seems improbable. I get it. Call me a flat earther etx but all the evidence points to it.

I could call you out  for selling so low but i wont. Profit is profit at the end of the day. All i will say is this is the definition of an asymmetric bet. Pick up a share just for the fun of it. You have been trading for 2 years im sure you can afford it.

BO is on the trajectory of doing orbital, but they currently have a comparable suborbital experience to SPCE and it's going to happen roughly at the same time (first paying customer in the summer). The existence of this will reduce SPCEs margins and market share.

This, or something similar, is a common portfolio.  Say you’re younger and you want to be slightly more aggresssive and by more growth stocks over value, you can add more in QQQ to achieve that. Get more returns, with more risk, when you don’t have to worry about a crash nearing retirement.

Even though SPY and VTI have many of the same holdings, it also has much more and lots of value stocks, so by adding 5-15% QQQ you’re increasing your exposure to more tech and growth stocks. It’s more volatile, but generally grows faster.

So instead of thinking of it as overlap, I’m using it to make my portfolio a little more risky beyond the S&P 500.

But if that was your intention, you don’t really need NOBL. That’s a lower risk, lower return fund. On the flip side…. Say you keep $20k in your savings account, but want to be able to access another  $40k in safer assets in your investment nets for bad years where there is a crash and lost of a job, the. You might choose to make $40k in investments in bond and low risk equity ETFs, and then everything over $40k follows the strategy you want.

What you could do is buy more small caps and mid caps. I like to keep 10-20% in small and midcaps. The Russell 2000 and the S&P 400 are indexes that will accomplish this. Mid caps over long periods have outcompeted the S&P 500, but tends to be more volatile.

Nothing fundamentally bad about the company,  and they're reinvesting in increased capacity,  facilities,  expanding in automotive etc. This is not only value,  but dropped into ""growth"" territory.

295,gzc8ss5,2021-05-25,t3_njmeaw,stocks,"I look for what I feel is a good company with damaged reputation.  The odd thing is, when I talk about investing in these kinds of companies, people always down them and talk about the possibility of bankruptcy.  The reality is, if you invest in a company that is at its best, where do you expect it to go?

During the pandemic I looked at carnival Cruise lines, it had been on a downwards trend prior to the pandemic, but took a beating during the pandemic.  March of last year I invested into carnival Cruise lines, about a month later the stock had already lost about a third of its value from where I bought in, so I bought more... I have achieved about a 200% profit on that stock now, it is close to three times my original investment.  I expect it's got about another 25 to 30% over its current value once it's full up and running again.  I don't expect it to get to his pre-pandemic stock value due to dilution and debt.

I had looked at Boeing a long time ago when the max got grounded. I'm kind of glad I didn't buy into it back then, because it took a long time before the fixed it and started delivering them again.  More recently they had a couple aircraft have their engines come apart in flight. Pratt and Whitney engines.  Pratt & Whitney is a private company, I can't invest in them through stocks. So... I invested in Boeing. It was trading about 250 when I bought into it, was trading at about 350 pre-pandemic.  I expect it to get back up to 350 when things are full up and running.  It drops since I first bought into it, so I buy a couple shares here, couple shares there. It's trading at less than 250 now, but I'm in the positive on it.

Rolls-royce, their premier engine had problems, hollow veins that were cracking.  This one is so cheap it's almost like a penny stock. It seems to go nowhere, hovering right around a buck 50 right now.  I don't expect this to go anywhere short-term, but I do expect it to double over the next two or three years.  So whenever I have extra cash in my portfolio, I buy a few shares.

I'm not recommending any of these stocks, I'm just trying to explain my thought process behind how I invest.

The stocks that I've taken the biggest beating on, namely SPACS, are ones I've heard about through other people, and follow their advice.  I definitely don't know everything, and I'm paying my tuition to learn, but I think I'll paddle my own boat from now on and not follow what other people say.

Value stocks are typically the companies that are “boring”, companies that are typically matured and have consistent and predictable revenue streams. While growth stocks are usually the ones that companies might not have positive earnings, but have good future outlooks. Stocks that look for innovation and development in new industries, etc. Tech is often mixed into growth as majority of Tech stocks are built around innovation.

A split is done in hopes of getting more investors and then raising again their share price. A reverse split is not so encouraging because it is looked upon as the company is struggling to maintain compliance. Both are done strategically to help the company in the long run.

TSLA isn't reconsidering LIDAR despite many claims that suggest they are. 

What is really going on, is that *TSLA has been using LIDAR to calibrate their vision range detection for years*, and someone took a picture of this setup. This means that every now and then they use a handful of LIDAR fitted Teslas to ensure the distance measurements that Autopilot/FSD are predicting are working accurately enough, and make any adjustments if needed to the system, so that they are working accurately enough. This doesn't imply they intend to start using LIDAR on the Teslas they sell.

Here is an article from 2016 that is also proposing that Tesla is going to be using LIDAR because it uses LIDAR for calibration, and stands by it's reporting even (after 5 years it seems to they still haven't moved to LIDAR):  
[https://www.thedrive.com/news/5804/elon-musk-may-be-secretly-planning-to-use-lidar-in-future-tesla-models-updated](https://www.thedrive.com/news/5804/elon-musk-may-be-secretly-planning-to-use-lidar-in-future-tesla-models-updated)

It has an official response from tesla (when they did have a PR department) at the end that reads:

>A spokesperson for Tesla responded with this statement: ""The claim that Tesla may be planning to use LiDAR as part of its self-driving hardware suite is fundamentally untrue. We regularly test our own technologies against other sensors to calibrate our camera, sonar and radar system.""

This is not anything new, it's probably something that's been done since they rejected LIDAR in the first place (if you are going to reject a sensor, verify that your system can do everything as well as if it had that sensor).",['TSLA'],1

I opened a SoFi account about 2 years ago for the debit card that reimburses all ATM fees (discontinued - but I’m grandfathered). At the time I banked with Chase. A year ago I moved to southwest Missouri for med school and discovered that there’s no Chase branch within 200 miles of me here. Rather than open a bank account with a local bank in my area, I decided to just give Sofi a shot as my primary banking solution and honestly I don’t see myself ever using a brick and mortar bank again.

It’s been nearly a year now since Sofi became my primary bank account and it works just fine for me. Really the only downside to using Sofi as my primary bank is that if I have to make a cash deposit (which is rare) I either have to pay a 5$ fee to make a green dot deposit at a Walgreens or cvs or deposit to another bank and then transfer.

&#x200B;

In bank accounts you get protections from the FDIC. In investing accounts you get protections through SIPC. These are things that help make sure you are protected, up a certain amount of money, if the financial institution goes under your assets are protected.

You don't have that with a Futures account.

Regulation is done through the CFTC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission. They regulate often through industry groups set up by commodity exchanges. They are are also more passive and provide a legal area where people make claims against each other on contracts. 

Futures are often leveraged. You can lose more than what you invest into it and they can get significantly risky. If something big happened in the market it is possible some couldn't pay their contract and there could be a shortage of money/run on money of futures account holders. 

I'd also note that financial futures trading is relatively new in the last few decades. Back in the '70s it was primarily for hedging for agricultural crops and mining operations, many of the regulations for the market have been established in the last few decades.

This means they haven't hammered out all the rules, not have they seen all the problems they might arise from financial futures trading during market conditions this trading hasn't been through yet.

They're not engaging in negative interest rates, but they are engaging in quantitative easing, which means buying up assets apart from just US treasuries.  These operations are at $120B per month right now, which is huge. 

In my understanding negative interest rates have never been implemented in the US, and politically I'm not sure how viable they would be. They're already very low, just not negative.

As for why they might raise rates, you have to keep in mind that the Fed has a dual mandate: full employment, and stable price levels. The point of lowering rates and QE is precisely what you said: stimulating the economy, making borrowing easier and hopefully creating jobs.  

You can't just engage in QE forever, however.  QE is basically printing money, because the Fed buys assets with money it creates electronically.  If they create too much money and there's too much of it sloshing around in the economy, then this raises prices on goods and services, which is inflation.

The general economic consensus is that some inflation (generally 2%, but even 4%) is good because it's better to have an excess of money than not enough.  This facilitates growth.  

However, more than that is a problem because prices start to become unreliable.  With 10% inflation something that cost you $100 last year would cost you $110, which is significant.  People don't know how to price things which leads to confusion and a lost of faith in the dollar.

So the Fed is playing a balancing act of stimulating the economy and thus creating jobs, while at the same time trying not to go overboard and keeping price levels steady.  Remember, this is their mandate.

With Covid the concern is actually *deflation*, because production and spending have been gutted, causing prices to fall.  That's why they're still engaging in QE and encouraging some inflation... they want to bring the economy back to full employment and health. 

There are some fears that they may be running a bit hot and inflation will cause them to need to raise rates sooner rather than later.",[],0

NIO wont be abe to make as many cars as you think in the next several years. I think NIO can be great in the future, and the price of 30 dollars will be justified only in 10 years, when they can make and sell enough cars and maintain a stable revenue. Now it’s a young and heavily overpriced company, which is a common phenomenon at the end of a bull run, but nothing is Ok about the pricing of NIO. It’s a company between 1-3 dollars per share. This does not mean that it’s bad or can not be a 40 dollar company after a long period of time.

Weird comment there, to be honest. The stock is splitting - currently at nearly 650 it was at 580 before the announcement.  After a split it would still have traded at 145 a share at pre-announcement prices for the same market cap. At what price do you think a company should consider splitting their stock?

The only fundamental that changes is the number of shares outstanding which will rise from 622M to 2.45 billion. If you're referring to the market cap of the company (around 385 billion) not being supported by the recent results then OK, it seems a bit overvalued based on P/E and P/S ratios, but that didn't stop them running up to nearly 600 per share before any discussion of a split.",[],0

- Owns 51% of the company Nio uses for manufacturing 
- Owns 51% of the company Nio will use to build and sell mass-market EVs
- Owns 25% of Volkswagen's Chinese EV subsidy based in Anhui 
- Largest shareholders are Volkswagen and the province of Anhui (who bailed out Nio), meaning they're likely to be remain closely linked to VW and NIO. 

Current market cap is 2 billion. Seems a tad underpriced given their close links to VW and NIO's EV operations in China, no? They'll own slightly more of Nio's mass-market company than Nio themselves. Chinese-listed EV stocks have tiny valuations compared to those who are US-listed.",[],1

There certainly is the desire to catch up to Western brands in general and the unveiling of Chinese cars at the Shanghai automotive exhib definitely makes people proud and gets them to talk but in the end they end up buying Teslas because Tesla is Tesla, know what I mean?

But it is true. Nio has opened a showroom in a space that couldnt be more prominent in one of the more upscale shopping malls. There is always someone inside but it is not really crowded.

Apart from that ppl just love BMW, Mercedes, AMG, VW and especially Tesla over here. I feel it is not a given for Nio to grab a good share of EV market. Especially with VW around breaking into the EV market as well.",['TSLA'],1
