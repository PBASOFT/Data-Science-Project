Using techniques pioneered in the construction of Asfluidijk in the Netherlands, we can map energy output as a function of dam geometry, ocean floor bathymetry, and tidal patterns. It‚Äôs called dynamic tidal power (DTP) and my project I‚Äôve been (kinda putting off since I started trading) working on is creating an engine that can explore and refine these distributions using real current velocity data. Basically I want to build a Microsoft Flight Simulator meets rollercoaster tycoon but for renewable energy structures. Once the engine is out there, and if it works, well have a starting point to compare DTP to traditional hydro, solar, and nuclear.

Golden comets fly through space, rare metals are not as much defined by scarcity these days and the era of physical evaluation is sending it's regards. So I wouldn't be so sure.

But you will always be able to buy food and wood for the fire. Mining in space will certainly be very expensive and someday maybe even a reality when there are no more resources on earth. Everyone should do it as he thinks, I know what I do and so far very satisfied. I have hedged myself and therefore completely independent of crypto or fiat currencies. So this is absolutely perfect. Physical precious metals like gold and silver, commodities and mines with substance and still PSLV that is my way.  
No investment advice, everyone should think for himself what he does.

So yea, I would expect them to integrate the app, even if it was just on the back-end. That makes it more efficient than running two separate tech stacks and support, and HUGE cost savings. I am sure they priced in loss revenues from adjusting their delivery distances, but they will most likely make up for it in the cost savings by merging the apps.   


Plus, the value in Uber is the re-opening play. Once their rides business picks up, with a sustained Eats division, expect them to hit profitability by EOY. They shed off a lot of their moon-shots divisions, and have great investments on the balance sheets.

Wake up & smell the coffee, this stock is way under valued and that huge ass short position is looking like really vulnerable to me. Take a look?",[],0

4903,gzb3rau,2021-05-24,t1_gzb0quz,wallstreetbets,"A short squeeze is totally disconnected from any fundamental value. When you short a stock you have to return the shares. So all the buying pressure will be coming from the hedge funds when they are forced to buy back shares that they borrowed. The problem is you're a hedgefund and you shorted more stocks than are available because you've always been able to do whatever you've wanted to with no consequences. But now the only shares available are owned by apes who are not selling which drives the price to the moon. That's the situation in a nutshell. 

Other short squeezes have occured with 20% short interest but GME is at least 140% but with the way the numbers are being fudged and hidden, I'm thinking it's actually 200-500%. Based on what comparable situations we have, there's no way this isn't touching 100's of thousands per share and I'm betting it goes into the millions. It's not about money anymore, it's about justice for the 2008 crash and other thievery. Apes are dead set on holding until every hedgefund involved in this circus is liquidated.

5472,gzb56vf,2021-05-24,t3_nk6ehy,wallstreetbets,"A burst of bets against Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc., the company founded by billionaire Richard Branson, over the past month has ratcheted up the temperature for short-sellers after the company delivered a successful test flight over the weekend.

Nearly 14 million shares of the Las Cruces, New Mexico-based company were sold short over the past 30 days, meaning the stock‚Äôs Monday surge after a test flight has dealt short-sellers millions of dollars in losses, data compiled by financial analytics company S3 Partners show. With short interest sitting at $949 million, more than a fifth of shares available for trading are sold short and that could prompt bears to cover their bets, S3 Partners said.

That increase in short selling has already resulted in mark-to-market losses of $427 million for bears this year -- with $366 million of those losses occurring over the last eight days, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, wrote in a report Monday. With short bets against the company getting more crowded and as losses increase, the company appears to be ripe for a short squeeze, he wrote.

A short squeeze occurs when a stock posts a large gain, forcing short sellers to cover their positions by buying shares, which in turn pushes the stock even higher.

Virgin Galactic soared as much as 21% in Monday‚Äôs trading to the highest level since April 14 after the company conducted its first test flight to space in more than two years. Michael Ciarmoli, an analyst at Truist Securities, called the event a ‚Äúmajor milestone.‚Äù

With Virgin Galactic ‚Äústock price rallying, we should at minimum expect this surge in short selling come to an abrupt stop and more likely be replaced with short covering,‚Äù Dusaniwsky wrote. He also estimated that with losses piling up, it‚Äôs become increasingly likely that newer shorts may capitulate and trim their positions.",['SPCE'],0

I don't act on everything they recommend or suggest.  I just don't trade enough for that, but at the cost (couple hundred bucks), if I may 3-5 decisions a year on it, it is VERY well worth it to me.  

Overall, I look at what they recommend (if I have money to drop in, I usually have a min amount of $5k that I want to put on any rec) and then see if it makes sense to me.  Some of the businesses don't, or there will be like a dozen app companies recommended and I only want 1-2, etc.  

If I have smaller amounts to drop in, I'll usually re-up on something I already own.  I do follow the sell advice.

If I were spending your $1k/mo, I'd invest $2k every 2 months, checking existing recommendations to see what may be depressed that you think will come back.  If I didn't find anything super inspiring, I'd just drop it on one of the 'core' stock recommendations.  I think I have like 7-8 of their recommended 'starter stocks' (from over the years).",[],1

When someone cannot build up M1/M2 to dump into M3+/investment they stagnate fiscally.. this doesn't mean they cannot rise out of it.. but when he says ""people live on M1/m2"" it's accurate for the overwhelming majority that live paycheck to paycheck.  You have to have money going to the small business owner through M2 in order for them to put food on the table and pay for things and move inventory through the system to the consumer....   Literally every boomer on your block is likely trying to stack into M3/investment as they rely upon pension/SS/investments which outpace the F of their expenses....  The ""eat the rich"" motto isn't coming from these boomers!  They are not spending that excess $ they are receiving and instead just stacking higher into M3/investments because they don't need it to live off of.  

It's extra for them to pass onto their kids.

# FAQ
 
## What does this mean?
 
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
 
## Why did you do this?
 
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
 
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
 
## Am I banned from the Reddit?
 
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
 
## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
 
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
 
## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
 
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",[],0

This is not just some random speculative boring pre revenue biomed stock that may or may not work. It's the fucking future and VG is one of the first to create and enter a new industry. And I will support them as best I can with the money I have.
