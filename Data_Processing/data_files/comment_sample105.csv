Some 30% down. Etc. I’d look at the data set you have and see if you can figure that out.

Over time through the good and bad, compare how that portion of your portfolio does to those. They don’t always make drastic large gains, but they generally keep gradually going up over time. It’s just a way to keep yourself honest.  

I wouldn’t say companies like Tesla is established. They just barely turned a profit for the first time. People are excited about it for what it could be in 5 or 10 years. Intel, apple, Microsoft, JP Morgan chase…. Those are established and been turning solid profits for awhile. They might not make as huge gains and most of the time will be less volatile.

This is basically on historicals how the major brokerages have eliminated commission trades and how RH makes it's money (paying for order flow).

Right now, the company PRINTS cash and is profitable, bonus points. 

But coinbase only makes money by how often people trade, and if everyone keeps predicting that BTC will be a store of wealth, then then need to trade it is very minimal, especially as the price gets higher and higher.

This same principle of the price being high also lives in the current stock market since some companies like a high stock price to avoid massive volatility in the market.

Besides just their core competency, they just announced the launch of a media arm, though not sure how well that will turn out. As you can see from the stock price today, investors didn't take it so well.

Everything I claim to be sure of, I say with the knowledge that just because I’m “sure” doesn’t mean I’m right. I hold this philosophy with all my beliefs, not just financials. 

With that out of the way, it is _my_ belief that a lot of the big banks are wayyyy fucking over leveraged, and are also using really risky assets as collateral. So basically 2008 but instead of the mortgage backed securities contributing to that cluster fuck it’s commercial mortgage backed securities this time around. 

There’s also a lot of fucky shorting going on with treasury bonds but I’m not even going to try and go into that because it goes even higher over my head than the CMBS issue does, and I think at this point it’s obvious I’m not an expert. 

Oh yea and GameStop is shorted to fucking oblivion and when it pops citadel is going to be liquidated and that’s going to lead to a temporary market crash. 

In summary: big banks have been fucking around, and they’re about to find out. Of course, I’m sure the middle and lower class are gonna get the shitty end of the stock as always. 

P.S. I’m not trying to convince you of anything, so if you don’t believe me about any of the comments I made, particularly regarding GameStop, I kinda... don’t care? Not to be mean, I just have my opinions, my current investments represent those opinions, and now I’m strapped in waiting for the show to start.

\- I own Coinbase shares and am long term bullish on the stock.

\- I have no other affiliation or non-public knowledge of Coinbase.

Here is a comparison of basic metrics between Coinbase, Paypal, and Square. I picked Paypal and Square because they offer minimal crypto services and are at least in the money/finance/payements ecosystem. It is hard to find something to directly compare to Coinbase. A standard brokerage/exchange would work, but most of those are established and do not fit the high growth profile(Fidelity, Schwab, etc.). When RobinHood or SoFi are fully public and have at least one full quarter or more of results they would be better comparisons.

                      Coinbase  Paypal  Square
    Price/Sales(ttm): 41.58     12.70   7.68
    Price/Book(mrq):  33.73     14.77   39.93
    Forward P/E:      28.90     53.76   140.85

Coinbase is highly valued. Whether it is overvalued is in the eye of the beholder. Most high growth companies have crazy metrics for years, pick one at random and look at their historical values. 

I will say that the P/S and P/B values are worrisome. Those ratios will require a minimum 2-3x expansion to bring down to Paypal levels(which itself has high ratios). Coinbase is particularly hampered by its dependence on transaction fees. Coinbase compares better to Square, but Square itself is a high growth and highly speculative company with its own growth issues.

Coinbase will perform well in the short term. However in that short term and contrary to performance I expect the share price to fall by half or more in the next 6 months, settling around $100-125 before starting back up as multiple quarterly results come in and Coinbase continues to outperform.

That performance will be contingent on Coinbase adopting an aggressive strategy over the next 12-24 months that expands beyond transaction fees for primary revenue:

1.  Carefully select and groom debut crypto releases

Coinbase will seek out or even develop new crypto assets to debut on Coinbase. These selected cryptos will have short term exclusivity periods where they can only be traded on Coinbase. Expect any unique features of these cryptos to be fully supported by Coinbase(and possibly only by Coinbase).

2. Offer smart contract and block chain powered derivatives services

Imagine crypto assets that mirror real world assets or other digital assets with Coinbase as the exchange or clearing house. The Mirror Protocol is designed for this and there are other blockchain initiatives to do the same. Such mirrored blockchain assets could facilitate an entire shadow equities derivative market, or real estate, or anything that can be captured by the blcokchain. I'm sure someone will say this can be done without Coinbase(or other authority) but at the end of the day people always seek out something reliable, something certified, something safe, and Coinbase will be the well known crypto/blockchain service that can do that.

3. Acquisitions

Coinbase has cash and is raising more, like the recent effort to raise $1.25 billion in senior notes. I expect some of this cash and possibly future offers will be used to acquire competitors or entities with unique crypto/blockchain technologies.

4. Expand tradeable assets with curated crypto selections

For the last few months Coinbase has been almost frozen adding very few new crypto assets to its tradeable list. I believe Coinbase has been holding its breath during the IPO, trying to keep everything as static as possible to avoid any missteps. Now that the IPO is past, expect a rush of new assets to be added. In fact this has already started, with the addition of a half dozen new cryptos in the past two weeks. Coinbase is unlikely to ever have the large lists of Binance, Bithumb, KuCoin, etc., but it will counter that all of its choices are carefully curated for value, security, and longevity.

5. Timed trading fee reductions

As the features above roll out, expect Coinbase to offer targeted and heavily advertised reductions in its fee structure. This will counter pressure from other exchanges and, depending on the scope of the reductions, reverse effects and apply pressure to the other exchanges.

If Coinbase can do some or most of the above, they will maintain their first mover advantage and achieve lasting dominance in the market.

(Oh and I can't justify or prove any of this, but this is what I would do as Coinbase)",[],0

Which is already a task in itself.  She has just been warned that if she can't update her homeowners/flood insurance that they will have no choice but to take the house.  My mother is ""81"" and had one steady Check a month that barely covers her food and medications.  It just baffles my mind how the mistake by a ""Wells Fargo"" employee can change a Families life?!??!!  This has been a travesty... And I know ALL YOU WANT IS NUMBERS... JUST NUMBERS! BUT THE PURE SLIGHT OF A WELLS FARGOS EMPLOYEES WRIST CANNOT EVEN BE CLOSE TO QUANTIFIABLE ON HOW WELLS FARGO HAS CHANGED OUR LIVES! NOW I WILL GET YOU MY LICENSE TESTING DATES/ PRICE OF TESTING. PRICE OF TESTING EXAM MATERIAL, PRICE OF CLASSES I TOOK, TRAVEL TO AND FROM CLASS AND TESTING. AND ALSO MY APPLICATIONS THAT I HAVE SUBMITTED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT FOR THE 1ST TIME. Physician APPOINTMENTS MISSED. MEDICATIONS MISSED. MEDICATIONS STOLEN ETC ... BUT ONCE AGAIN ""MY TIME"" IS WHAT SHOULD BE QUANTIFIABLE !!  IF WELLS FARGO DROPS THE BALL ON ThIS, Than we absolutely have to get the word out!  This is exactly what we are seeing in today's society with the ""Blue collar""... Working to progress... Especially ""AFRICAN AMERICAN"" FAMILY TRYING TO TREAD WATER AND SHOOT FOR MIDDLE CLASS.... AND A CORP SUCH AS WELLS FARGO INCORPORATED... HANDS A CHECK FOR $500 AND Wink/Nod tells then to sit down and shut up in so mY word.  If you have a better scenario, I would love to see how you apply terms!!

If you are unable to handle the mental pressure of the market ups and downs, you could also just donate your coins to the COVID India Crypto Fund. You can just wash your hands off thinking you've spent it for something good.

As regular-income Indians we don't get to play with money man. We get what we get as salaries and we use investment instruments that can get the returns above inflation (atleast over 6%) along with some tax benefits and we stay happy with that. Quick money schemes are almost always a lie and I understand the FOMO behind things like GME or DOGE boom happening but trust me... Long-term investment is where it's at.

Buy when the RSI is at the bottom. Sell when RSI is at the top. I typically buy position when it hits one of the EMA/SMA. I Zoom out to see if it trending to hit the 200-day moving average or the 50day EMA. I Buy when it hits one of those meaning.
