Good support on the \~74$ line, looks to be holding, my personal stop loss is at 70$ if that breaks it's open to free fall.

On the 1H candles, break out over 50ma, resistance at 200ma, rsi peaking at 70, propably will come down to get support from 50ma again before breaking over the 200ma.

Nasdaq index looks to have made bottoms at 13000 and is on long trend again, or at least will go sideways for the summer period, between 13k and 14k.

NOT a investing advice, personally im long with 2040 shares target 100$ average price 77$

A lot can happen in 6 months, I actively follow the movements and if something happens am ready to sell early and buyback when TA looks good again.

The way I see it is there is no way that the price of SPCE will stay the same from today going into Monday. 

One of three options are going to play out.

1. Successful test flight
2. Test flight delayed, again 
3. Unsuccessful test flight

Regardless of the situation, the needle is going to move a LOT. How are you playing this rocket ride? 

I have a few 17p and 16p expiring Monday and a few HUGELY OTM calls expiring next Friday. I’m more expecting a total failure, but on the off chance it’s a huge success those calls are going to print.

What are y’all’s positions?

And to all the people saying you wouldn’t touch SPCE with a 40 foot pole, why? The stock is going to move one way or another and if you’re really that against it, buy puts and put your Twitter fingers to work.

The electric vehicle (EV) space, there are multiple stocks from which to choose that have the potential to deliver exponential gains over the long term. Tesla (TSLA) remains the market leader in the EV segment. However, this disruptive industry is attracting capital from retail and institutional investors because it is expandingÂ  rapidly.

378,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"**Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy every MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

https://preview.redd.it/z8gvmc77ml071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=7584983651d13d7a8304098dffcd011109fc12e3

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/aa8ly369ml071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=67b2c365b81e385f25387cee225ea73634f84126

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0
379,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"So first of all, Im not rich. I dont have 100 thousands of dollars. But if you only listen to rich people for advice, then this DD isnt for you. 

Edit: nice close at 19$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When fully operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. It will take time before they even sell half of that each year, so this is very good.



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Quebec will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Quebecker one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only local but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.


Have a good day and may your portfolio be green!",nhyn43,['TSLA'],0
385,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"While SNDL’s market cap is only about a fifth of TLRY, it has more cash than Tilray on its balance sheet. In its earnings release, SNDL said that as of May 7, it had $752 million of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet.


Now, there are two narratives if you are interested in buying SNDL stock. First is the bullish one that points to the ample cash on its balance sheet. SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.

394,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"After Northland Securities upgraded LendingTree’s price target to $225 (approx. 9.5% upside), I decided to do a quick company analysis and outlook to see if I agree with their PT.

   * Independent Director G. Thompson purchase 1.4M worth of share at about $282/share
   * Suggests a positive outlook for the company as the price was bought above the price it was trading at then

# Industry Overview and Outlook

* Low-interest rates have fueled consumer demand for refinancing existing debt and access to new debt
* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs
   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending
* Strong economy coupled with strong employment numbers have led to a surge in home sales
   * Pandemic-drriven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006
   * 5.6% increase YoY for homes sold
   * Sales in January 2020 were 22% stronger than in December 2019
* 51% of mortgage lenders are non-banks
   * 5 of the largest mortgage lenders in the U.S are non-banks
* Projected $73.7B in loan origination for 2022
   * $35.6B from personal loans, $13.6B from small and medium entrepreneur loans, and $24.5B from refinancing student debt
   * Approx. 79.3% growth since loan origination value of $41.4B from 2017
* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

Even though their cards are the strongest ray tracing cards in the market, their stock price hasn't moved since they released.

In the short term, there is a worldwide silicon shortage. NVidia needs to at least fulfill enough demand to meet earnings expectations. Since AMD, which is outperformed in ray tracing, killed earnings this quarter, NVidia will too.

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record.

417,2021-05-22,wallstreetbets,"Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about *why* the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, *you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses.* Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit. Pricing sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. A lot of people who have the brainpower to price a stock don't have the conviction/temperament to stick by their call in the face of market swings. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

In any event, I have no actual point to this post, I just thought it was a really good insight. Go read his book!",niahr7,[],0
426,2021-05-22,wallstreetbets,"Hello,

I have been buying GME since May 2020. I currently have a 200k bet that GME goes up. I want the squeeze as much as anyone.

However, I feel like it is my duty to explain what is going on. The $10,000,000 share price is not going to happen. Whales want you to think it is possible so they can sell at $500 and there will be enough depth in the market to exit.

How can we know this for sure? The NYSE literally cannot quote stock prices that high. Furthermore, the SEC and politicians literally think it is their job to reduce market volatility. When Gme went to $300 the White House got involved, there is no way they will let it go to $10,000 - much less $10,000,000.

Think about it: would any president allow the economy to crash over a video game company? Right as midterms are heating up? No, the government will halt trading for days, or weeks, until a deal is brokered with GME directors. Ryan C may not want to issue more stock, but it will be the only way to avoid jail time for “stock manipulation”. If you don’t think the gov will send innocent ppl to jail, then you have not been paying attention.

The point of this post is not to make anyone sad or angry, it is to offer good trading advice. I see people breaking up with their loved ones, underperforming at work, or alienating others over this saga. Don’t do this. life is long and you do not want to trash what you have built bc you think one share of GME is a winning lotto ticket. 

Everyone has their own exit strategy. Don’t let anyone talk you out of making money. if you think this is FUD, then you really have fallen for the whales and you will be left holding our bags.

I wish the best to everyone here. Good luck: Buy, Hold, Vote and plan an exit strategy!

It is an ancient concept almost as old as man himself. There has been nothing really new about inflation in the thousands of years of inflation’s history, and there still is not. Governments have been repeating the same mistake throughout history, sometimes leading to vicious cycles of hyperinflation. They have perpetually been rediscovering first the splendors and later the woes of inflation. Foolishly, each new government discovering this ” magic of money” seems to believe that no one has ever beheld such splendors before. The end result is always the same – the death of money.

Admittedly this is a long post, but we have to follow the thread of inflation throughout history to understand what is happening in the United States today. That is exactly what we will do. We will also look at one particular case where inflation never happened, the 2008 financial crisis. Later in the post, there is a comparison between what the Federal Reserve is doing today regarding the Covid-19 response stimulus package and the inflation trends throughout history. Finally, we will make our case why we believe that inflation is about to rise in the United States.

# In the beginning, was inflation

Money probably made its first appearance soon after the earliest caveman had his first successful hunt. Not long after he started hunting, he probably realized he could use animal skin as counters for trading spearheads and other goods with other cave dwellers. Anything like those animal skins with an accepted symbolic value, greater than its intrinsic value, was true money.

Because of human nature’s inherent yearning for more power and status, it probably did not take long for the smarter amongst the cavemen leaders to realize that controlling money was key to increasing his fortune. If he could decree what money was, then he could issue the money and gain political power. Not only that, but he could also benefit materially by exchanging money for things like spearheads and caves. We can speculate endlessly about what form the first money manifested in. It does not really matter. What is important is that the money manifested in a form that only the caveman leader could control. Probably something in the form of a specific animal’s skin that only he was allowed to hunt.

Along with a rising requirement for more caves and spearheads, the leader probably responded by hunting this exclusive animal more. As he hunted more, more animal skins became available, and the animal skins started losing their value as a means of trading. Undoubtedly, it did not take long for the price of spearheads and caves to rise in terms of animal skins. Buckled under the pressure of an oversupply of animal skin that was losing value, the subordinate cavemen experienced the first-ever inflation.

Not only was this the first example of inflation, but it was also the first example of government finance.

# Inflation through the ages

Man has evolved and progressed in many ways since the days we first left our caves. We landed on the moon and created the Higgs Boson collider. Yet, in contrast, there has been little progress in the area of inflation. In terms of inflation, there is nothing new under the sun. From the caveman beginnings to today, governments have perpetually rediscovered first the splendors and later inflation woes. This tragedy of the magic of money causing the death of money keeps on repeating itself in different forms. What follows here is a thread of inflation through history into the present day.

# The death of the Nummus (300 A.D)

&#x200B;

[Nummus Coins](https://preview.redd.it/0koiv421wp071.jpg?width=246&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b9a4fe807e5cb8dd78f714f1897f66b8dd555be)

One of the most violent and earliest forms of inflation occurred around the year 300 A.D. Not only was it a violent affair in terms of killing money. It also caused the death of hundreds of Romans in the form of the death penalty.

Nummi was a Roman empire era government-issued coin. It was made of copper washed with silver. The material to manufacture this coin was abundant across the Roman empire and, as a result, cheap to manufacture. As a natural consequence, the Roman empire, under Emperor Diocletian, produced more and more coins.

As more and more Nummi coins were produced, the Nummi started losing value. The price of goods and services began to rise. In response to this, the Emperor introduced strict price control measures in the form of price ceilings. Violators of the stipulated price ceilings would receive the death penalty. After inflicting many death penalties, the situation still did not improve. There were just too many Nummi in circulation, rendering it worthless. At some point, ordinary Romans preferred trading in items ranging from clay pottery to stones and ornaments instead of the Nummi. It is not the first time in history we will see basic elements like clay carrying more value than money. During the 1920s hyperinflation in Germany, it was cheaper to use paper money for making fires instead of purchasing firewood.

The result? The death of the Nummi. Throughout history, we will see the same pattern emerge where the “magic” of inflation leads to the death of money.

# Inflation through the centuries

So it has gone throughout man’s recorded history. Man has known inflation for centuries. Babylon and Ancient China both recorded inflations. The kings of England and France were inflationists, especially King Henry. The 1700s was characterized by worldwide inflation. The American Revolution and French revolution were the precursors of the paper printing mania of the 20th century. Throughout history, rising prices have been the rule and not the exception.

# The 1920 Germany hyperinflation

One of the well-known examples of hyperinflation is that of Weimar Germany in the 1920s. In the early 1920s, Germany was in a period of hyperinflation. In the end, the mark was worth only one trillionth of its original value. By November of 1923, the currency would depreciate to 4,200,000,000,000 marks to one US dollar.

Below are examples of 20,000,000, 50,000,000, 1,000,000,000, and 5,000,000,000 mark bills. At the time of hyperinflation, ordinary Germans would use notes like these to purchase basic goods like bread.

# The German inflation had its roots in World War I

Leading up to World War I, Germany decided to drop the gold standard. The gold-backed Reichsmark (or “Goldmark,” as it was referred to from 1914) became the unbacked Papermark. Initially, the Reich financed its war outlays in large part by issuing debt. Total public debt rose from 5.2bn Papermark in 1914 to 105.3bn in 1918. Germany hoped that it would quickly win the war and reap the bounty from the nations it conquered. Like all other governments before them, the Germans first discovered the splendors and later the woes of inflation.

During the war, the government used propaganda to hide the dire situation of the economy from the German public. Regardless of their propaganda attempts, the Germans could feel its detrimental effect in their daily lives. As a consequence, many soldiers deserted the war to head back home to support their families. In November 1918, things reached a boiling point. From all walks of life, Germans across the political spectrum united and took control of Germany’s cities. Furious at their material conditions, they demanded an end to the war. Kaiser Wilhelm II’s monarchy was toppled, and the war ended.

# The treaty of Versailles

The new Weimar Republic faced tremendous economic and political challenges. Already under pressure from internal crises, the treaty of Versailles just added more fuel to the fire.  According to the treaty, repatriations were to be repaid to the victorious allies. These repatriations were equivalent to half a trillion contemporary US dollars. The new and fledgling democratic government wanted to cater as best as possible to the wishes of their voters. For this reason, the government opted not to increase taxes too aggressively. As a result of this, tax revenues were insufficient to finance these outlays. Consequently, the Reichsbank (Germany’s central bank) started running the printing press.

# The result of the German hyperinflation

From April 1920 to March 1921, the ratio of tax revenues to debt amounted to just 37 percent. As the Reichsbank printed more currency to make up the difference, the rates worsened, and hyperinflation quickly reared its head. At its height, hyperinflation in Weimar Germany reached rates of more than 30,000% per month. To put this into context, one has to compare the price of eggs over time. In 1918, you could have bought 500 billion eggs for the same money you would have to spend five years later for just one egg. Essentially the money was worthless. Prices of goods and services doubled every few days. In fact, the money was worth less than firewood. Below are some historic photos from the time.

# How did the German hyperinflation end?

Hyperinflation has become untenable. Farmers refused to take any form of paper money for their crops. The harvest of 1923 sat in farmers’ warehouses while supermarkets in the cities were empty. As a result, starvation and civil unrest loomed.

On Oct. 15, 1923, the Rentenmark Ordinance was published. This paved the way for a new currency to be issued by a new institution, the Rentenbank. This new currency would be equivalent in value to the gold-linked prewar mark, or Rentenmark. At last, the printing of the now-defunct Papermarks ceased on November 15th. On Nov. 20. The devalued Papermark was pegged to the Rentenmark at a trillion to one. As a consequence, the hyperinflation ended, and Germany was back on a gold standard system.

Interestingly, the Rentenbank apparently held no gold bullion. Instead, the bank held mostly debt in mortgages on property and bonds on the German industry. Moreover, the Rentenmark was also not redeemable in gold. The main thing with the Rentenmark was that its value remained equivalent to gold. This was accomplished by reducing its issuance if any threat of its market value fell below that parity. The mechanism that cured the hyperinflation was the simple adjustment of supply.

# Lessons learned from the German hyperinflation.

The first lesson is that even a politically independent central bank does not provide reliable protection against the destruction of (paper) money. The Reichsbank had been made politically independent as early as 1922 already. This was a request on behalf of the allied forces as a service rendered. In return, they temporarily agreed to deferred reparation payments. Still, the Reichsbank council decided to hyperinflate the currency.

The second lesson is that fiat paper money won’t work without being backed by some standard. Throughout history, the gold standard proved to be a great inflationary measure control. Paper money is political money, and as such, it is a disruptive element in a system of free markets that does more good than harm.

*""Ensuring the possibility for redeeming in gold at any one time must be the endeavor of all issuers of paper money."" -* HJALMAR SCHACHT

Paper money, injected into the economy through bank credit, brings about a situation of over-indebtedness. The policy of choice to cure the remedy of over-indebtedness? Printing even more money. Undoubtedly, it is a vicious cycle.

The present-day United States has been using credit-produced paper monies for decades. Because of this, we can draw many interesting similarities between the United States and the Weimar republic. But first, we will examine why the 2008 financial crisis stimulus-response never caused any significant inflation.

# The inflation that never happened

Many analysts erroneously compare what is happening now in the United States with what happened in 2008. In reality, the two situations could not have been more different.

When central banks print money at a fever pitch, it does not necessarily mean that money ends up in the hands of people and businesses. 2008 is a classic example of this. The modus operandi of the FED is to issue money by purchasing Treasuries and Mortgage-backed loans from the banks. In turn, this money goes to the bank’s reserves that they can then lend out.

So what happened in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis? Instead of lending the money out, the banks hoarded the cash themselves in a desperate attempt at self-preservation. It is important to keep in mind the economic climate at the time. The 2008 financial crisis was spurred on by banks not having sufficient cash reserves, causing them to default. After Lehman Brothers went bust, banks started hoarding as many reserves as possible.

The consequence? Most of the money printed by the FED never ended up in the hands of the people. As a result, inflation never increased. The below graph illustrates the amount of paper money held as reserves by banks in the U.S. Notice the increase after 2008.

# Why inflation in the U.S will rise

The reason is the same as all other inflation periods in history: too much money supply causing the currency to degenerate in value. A picture is worth a thousand words, and the below graph showing the money supply in the U.S economy shows it all.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hjpy98c3xp071.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=5061a190ad0c8388206b38a64e7e9dc7f9a7b8be

In 2020 alone, the Federal Reserve printed more than 20% of all dollars ever printed. Illustrated by the graph above, one can see why there is an increasing concern in this regard. The 2020 money supply dwarfs out even the 2008 financial crisis response. In context, 2008 was a previous money printing record and has already raised concerns back then. In 2020 the Federal Reserve printed more money than the last four years combined.

# Why the Covid-19 stimulus will cause the inflation

We already touched on the fact that most of the money printed by the FED in 2008 ended up being hoarded by the banks. As a result, very little of the 2008 response made it into the hands of people and businesses. The Covid-19 relief stimulus package is very different in two respects. The first is that banks can not hoard any more money. They have reached full capacity regarding what reserves they can store before running into liquidity crises themselves. This is alarming because the banks hoarding money in 2008 was the only thing standing between the FED and a rapid rise in inflation. The second reason is unlike in 2008, billions of dollars are injected into the real economy into the hands of businesses and people. This is the typical pattern that has caused inflation throughout history. In fact, there is no difference.

# Banks complain they have too much money now.

The modus operandi of the FED is not much different in terms of raising money than it was in 2008. They followed the same recipe. If it worked for them in 2008, why would it not work now? The problem is that banks have too much money now. It does not seem like something that would be a problem for most people. Why would anyone complain about having too much money, you might ask. We will cover that in detail. First, have a look at the scrapbook of newspaper articles touching on the same subject.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/be3qwedbxp071.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb5cbb9ae23b2bccbe9d13f70ef2bdd90981357

To understand why too much money is a bad thing for banks, we first have to explain the basic business model of banks. Banks make their money by accepting deposits and then lending out their reserves at an interest rate. In return, they also pay an interest rate to the depositor, albeit a lower rate.

With the FED printing and raising money to the extent they have, banks already sit with too many reserves. Adding to that, you have all the extra deposits coming in from people receiving stimulus packages. At the same time, there is less appetite for people taking out loans due to the uncertainty regarding Covid-19. Banks now sit with deposits they have to pay interest on. At the same time, they are not making money from it by lending it out. Whereas in 2008, the banks were propping up the reserves, they are now desperate to lend out money.

Of course, there are other dimensions to this problem, like minimum regulatory capital requirements for each $1 deposited. Having too many reserves can also lead to banks running into liquidity issues.

In short, banks can not take on any more money. If there is any more rapid financing resulting from the FED printing more money, it will push banks into having liquidity issues. Unlike 2008, banks are desperate to lend out money. Add this money supply originating from the bank lending to the $2 trillion already released into the economy due to the stimulus, and you have the perfect inflation storm.

# The similarities between the Covid-19 stimulus package and past inflations

All inflation cycles in the past followed the same pattern. First, a rapid increase in money supply followed by the splendor of economic growth and prosperity. That, in turn, is later followed by inflation, leading to the death of currencies.

We already covered the fact that the saving grace in 2008 was that banks absorbed most of the money raised. Very little of the money printed by the FED made it into the hands of people. The Covid-19 stimulus is very different in this regard. This time around, the U.S. stimulus package allocates more than $2 trillion to different groups in society, injecting money into the real economy. The breakdown is as follows:

* $560 billion to individuals
* $500 billion to large corporations
* $377 billion to small businesses
* $340 billion to state and local governments
* $154 billion for public health
* $44 billion for education and other causes

Not only that, together with the stimulus by the previous Trump administration, the total stimulus amounts to more than 27 percent of the U.S GDP. That’s nearly four times the share implemented in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

The only other country with a more aggressive stimulus response to the Covid-19 pandemic is Japan. We all know Japan is not really the poster child to follow when it comes to inflation. Japan has been struggling with deflation for more than two decades.

# Why we conclude inflation will rise in the U.S

There is nothing new in terms of inflation, from the days of our earliest ancestors to the present day. The magic of money causes the death of money. Every time in history where governments have resulted in printing more unbacked paper money to stimulate economies, inflation followed.

The one exception was 2008. The reason for that is that banks absorbed most of the money. As a result, most of the stimulus the money did not make it into the real economy. The Covid-19 stimulus package is different in this regard. First of all, the banks don’t have the capacity to absorb more money without running into liquidity issues themselves. The second and most important difference with 2008 is the injection of $2 trillion into different parts of the economy. This is the same classic example we have seen throughout history. Not much more needs to be said about that other than throughout history, where more money was injected into the economy at this scale, inflation always followed without fail.

* **Current support at 60 SMMA**
* **Current resistance at 20 SMMA**

When asked the detail they reply by some evasive way. Let's look at the a very widely mentioned TA indicator know as Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA). Note that depending on the trading platform it might have different name. Here is a 1-day chart with moving average indicators for 20-day and 60-day below. The frequency of the data points are set at 1 minute.

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(1-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators ](https://preview.redd.it/9pgrbjn05q071.jpg?width=1915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f791febda72367d086560c590f33d3b80556d5b2)

The blue line is indicating 20-day SMMA and the orange line is 60-day. I drew some lines to show short term trend by pink and cyan colors. If you look at the price action around the pink straight lines you see that SPY is below both lines that means none of the 60-day or 20-day SMMA is acting as support here. Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen. Or it might happens a lot and that's why these TA guys never post their gains along with time of buy and sell orders.

Now they might say, well 1-min will not work do it for 15 minutes or even 5 minutes. Let's see exactly the same SPY daily chart with 5-minutes frequency below-

Exactly the same chart with only difference is number of data points, which is smaller due to 5 minutes time interval. Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.   

Now look at the same chart with 15-minutes time interval below-

While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals® (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

· IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration – Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

**DraftKings** is an American daily fantasy sports contest (dfs), sports betting operator (sportsbook), and virtual casino platform (igaming). Essentially it's a fucking money pit for retards who have gambling addictions, and according to a [Harvard Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230631/#:~:text=Based%20on%20its%20analysis%20of,activities%20in%20the%20past%20year) conducted in fucking 1997, approximately 1% of adults have gambling addictions, I'm sure with todays ease of access, it's more like 2%, so, \~6.6 million retards are at severe risk to giving DraftKings their bank accounts. Like I said, this shit is a money pit, they provide a service that results in LITERAL FREE MONEY. Instead of driving to a casino, these geniuses at DraftKings are allowing some individuals to gamble from the comfort of their couch, it's amazing. Also, when I say retards, take that lightly last Saturday, I gambled away, and streamed myself in an undisclosed off-brand WSB discord, $500 in an online casino, and gamble on sports, daily, hell, last NFL season I finished first in the r/sportsbook betting contest. [PROOF (i love gambling)](https://imgur.com/gallery/woD8Vpu). With that said, if you like something buy it, if you love something invest in it. I love gambling, and will invest in the BEST *legal* sports book out there, DKNG, aka Donkey Kong, aka Donkey Dick, aka Dick Kings. :kek:

**SWOT ANALYSIS of Dick Kings**

**STRENGTHS:**

* Industry leaders: currently DKNG is legal in more [states](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/help/sports-betting/where-is-sports-betting-legal?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2Fhelp%2Fsports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal&wpcn=help&wpscn=sports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal) than any other sportsbook platform, they're legal in 11, with 2 on the brink of legalization, and a window of opportunity by eoy for the remaining 11 states where it is legal.
* Marketing/Advertising: if you're a sports guy, you'll noticed DKNG is fucking everywhere, you cant escape it. They're all over social media and are on every fucking commercial.  They spent 77% OF THEIR [REVENUE ON MARKETING PLATFORMS LMAO](https://www.actionnetwork.com/legal-online-sports-betting/draftkings-reports-increased-revenue-marketing-2020-earnings).
* Partnerships: They currently have a partnership with the NFL, UFC, MLB, three [NBA teams](https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/02/draftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F&wpcn=about&wpscn=news%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F), and they own a [Nascar](https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2021/05/20/draftkings-joins-nascar-star-bubba-wallace-23xi-racing/). Not only that, but Disney (ESPN) has a 6% stake in their company, yeah the largest sports network in America owns a [6% stake of DKNG.](https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17950769) (dont fuck with the mouse). They also have upcoming partnerships with Dish Network, and I'm sure they have a fuck ton of other promotions on the way.
* Ease of access: you literally type it in the browser, or download an app. Deposit you wage cuck check through paypal or via debit card and within 1 hour your entire check could be gone, it's that easy.
* UI: You know how everyone says, ""oh don't use robinhood, it's bad, it's so cancer, they sell your data."" Shut the fuck up, you know that UI is fucking sexy and that's why you keep buying FDs that's the same shit with DKNG. I've used hundreds of online casinos and sportsbook, personally bovada is my go to, but for legal books, DraftKings is by far the best, no question. That platform is sexy, look how clean this is compared to fanduel.

**WEAKNESSES:**

* They care too much, and try to hard to make as much money as possible? wtf? you thought imma drop actual weaknesses when Imma shill. No thanks LMAO. Fan Duel, Barstool sportsbook is straight trash. dafuq.

**OPPORTUNITIES:**

* State Legalizations, currently there are only 24 states where sportsbooks, igaming is legal, but it's expected to be legal nationwide in the next 1-3 years. Maryland, Nevada, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and New York are on the brink of having DKNG in their states. I know a few of those states legalize literally just last week.
* Partnerships, with the amount of money DraftKings is spending, they're going to have deals with the NHL, NBA and possibly even some college ball in the next few months. I wouldn't be surprised to see DKNG become the official sportsbook of the NFL in the future. I know a few [stadiums](https://www.giants.com/news/draftkings-and-new-york-giants-announce-official-exclusive-sports-betting-deal) offer DKNG sportsbook in stadium, and I think this will become the norm in the next few years. You'll be able to go to a ballpark, stadium and place your bet directly there right next to your $40 beer (cause inflation).
* Social Media. I think where it stands right now, if you google DraftKings, their social media platform is okay, but in the next few months, especially near NFL season, it'll absolutely explode. They obviously have a facebook, twitter accounts, instagram and they are extremely interactive, they have daily podcasts and shit, but that's all so new. Their accounts are all growing, and I know as their social media presence becomes established, their brand name will grow as well.
* Buyouts, again, as a I said above Disney has a 6% stake in DKNG, I wouldn't be surprised to see Disney too onto their ownership and possible even buyout Draft Kings, I mean, imagine that. Disney, ESPN and DraftKings, all under the same parent company. That would be insane. You don't see Barstool (Penn), or Fanduel with that kind of opportunity.
* Igaming, I think this platform is so slept on. Virtual casinos are the fucking future, let me tell you, I've been doing this shit for years and once you legal bros get into this shit, you'll be hooked. There's absolutely nothing better than sitting your fat ass on the couch and blowing through hundreds of dollars betting martingale on black 7 times in a row. SHIT IS FUCKING GREAT. If they can develop a strong Igaming presence, they'll be loaded. Igaming is \~$[250 billion industry](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/gaming-market-2020-2025-size-share-trends-growth-value-and-research-report-2021-03-03?tesla=y#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,Mobile)

**THREATS:**

* Their only threat is competition, which is actually a strength because their competition is dog water. Barstool Sports can't get a partnership with the largest revenue sport, the NFL, because the NFL commish Roger Goodell absolutely hates the face of Barstool, aka Portnoy. I love Portnoy, but guy is a week away from some fucked up-cocaine induced canceling, I'm telling you. Barstool will entertain the stoolies, but they'll never become the Mcdonalds of fastfood, they'll always be the fucking nasty ass trash Burger King that you have to go to because the Mcdonalds line is too long. Fanduel is owned by a UK company, what do they know about American sports. WHAT COMPETITION.

Their revenue has absolutely gone bananas in Q1, which is fucking insane, because there were some rumors that DKNG lost a fuck ton of money from the [superbowl](https://www.nhbr.com/the-brady-effect-new-hampshire-lottery-sacked-in-super-bowl-betting/#:~:text=State%20takes%20a%20%243%20million,the%20Bucs%20and%20their%20QB&text=While%20New%20Englanders%20bet%20heavily,hole%20on%20Super%20Bowl%20Sunday). Anyway, as you can see their revenue grew a dick-ton. The big scary here is their net is horrible, why, the big no no? Sales and Marketing. I was worried about that too, but that's their game plan, to a spend a fuck ton of money to game market dominance early on, retention rate is key to this industry. Jason Robbins their CEO said it on a [podcast the other day](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93aGVyZXRoZW1vbmV5aXMubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/Nzg3ZDM1Y2QtMTgxYS00ODBhLTllZGMtMzFmZDdlNWNlMTIx?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwisjdvGtt7wAhWKUt8KHVAoCCkQjrkEegQIBBAI&ep=6), they're in preseason, training camp in this market. They're still warming up to the full opportunity.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/draftkings-reports-first-quarter-2021-results-and-raises-2021](https://preview.redd.it/gss8lcqt9r071.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b029bcf0dcd3b228673cf8f44bdb03399f7fb9e)

So to touch upon their spending again, as you can see their spending is working. They gained new degens at a rate of 114% compared to the first quarter of 2020. INSANE GROWTH. They're growing and retaining rates at a crazy level.

&#x200B;

[more good. less bad.](https://preview.redd.it/e2gnlks9ar071.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0bcbfce41aebfe664e836a247943d53217b9af8)

DKNG only has access to 25% of the U.S. population as of right now, and the stock is at what $45, what till this shit nation wide.

No dilution until $135 a share, and you aren't buying this absolute diamond right now? wtf.

**Price Targets**

DKNG is sitting pretty right above their low price target at $42.00, and you aint buying? Look at these price targets, a ceiling of $105.

**Institutional Ownership**

Look at the dates of filing and values. A lot of the media is shitting on Cathie Woods for buying DKNG religiously, but nobody is shitting on BlackRock for owning over 8million shares. As a wise man once told man, BlackRock is the United States testicles, they are the balls of this country. If they buy something, you know that shit is going to cum to the moon. It's insane how many of these big names are buying right now.

**Technical Analysis** so I hate to be the guy, but this is the [only stock I've traded all year](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/).

SHORT TERM(1-3 months):

[wedge, no vol.](https://preview.redd.it/eoqw7j1ocr071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=af1ced441b5aae74b9d3a8d6cd2a4f0db1c6e871)

As you can see from the chart above, we're currently trading in between the 7d sma and 50d sma on the 2hr. This is most likely complete confirmation bias, but I backed tested when DKNG has a daily closed inbetween this same crunch since it drooped the spac name, and whenever it has this same set up, these are the next day, and or two day returns.

02/10 +10.48% , 03/04 +13.89% , 03/25 +1.62% , 07/16 +9.46% , 09/09 +9.11% , 11/05 +9.05% , 1/08/21 +4.48% ,3/10/21 +11.48% , 04/26/21 +1.91%

Try it yourself. This is actually the reason why I bought weeklies eod friday. Check my positions at the top. I think in the next few weeks, DKNG will go to that top level resistance line at \~49.5, and then it could trade sideways for a bit longer to fill that volume gap from 44.5 to 49.5, but I do think a pump day is coming nonetheless.

LONG TERM(3-12 months):

[Support line](https://preview.redd.it/zdq66gyder071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=69931ee5a4f2a43686efeece722e3d70be27dd3f)

[RSI oversold](https://preview.redd.it/o3r1vmbger071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=67007d4b5eecd67dd3b513171209e5d5644883da)

So, longterm (3-12 month window), referring to the chart at the top, it looks like DKNG has found support off the 35.5 bottom it hit in September, there's massive volume support at the 42.5 line, and that looks to be the new floor (god forbid a market crash happens soon, plz no fomc june 18th taper tantrum). It looks like the next major test for DKNG is at the 200d SMA or 51.52. If you look at RSI, it's leaving oversold territory, and MACD is flashing a reversal. I think we're due for a next wave of highs on DKNG. I could see this popping to \~49.5-51.5 -> \~60 -> all time highs. TA is looking dumb bullish fucking idiots. Buy this shit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

in conclusion, I fucking love the stock. Technical and Fundamentals showing a strong buy. Dick Kings is about to cum, and be sure you're there to catch the cum, because once this thing is near it's edge, it's going to absolute nut. I know I wont want to miss suc.. am I gay? anyway. buy dkng.

I read that ByteDance plans to go public in 2021. Does anyone have any additional information? I will be putting money in them when they do go public. 

 The 38-year-old AI coding genius, searching for ByteDance’s next big act, has set his sights on China’s $1.7 trillion e-commerce arena. The co-founder has hired thousands of staff and roped in big-name sponsors like Xiaomi Corp. impresario Lei Jun to drive what he calls his next “major breakthrough” into global business -- selling stuff to consumers via its addictive short videos and livestreams.

Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

First off, if you've been living under a rock and don't know what Alibaba is, here's a video about what the company does from CNN Business. [https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness)

Alibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 6 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I took notice when these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that environmentally sustainable (basically they just monitor their carbon footprint), something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yen (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, roughly 10% off it's 52 week low.

Now what REALLY turned my head was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO. For Munger, one of THE most risk-adverse investors in history, to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

Since Munger's position was revealed, Reddit users took notice and has become the most talked about undervalued stock on Reddit.

And then called me out in a post - without calling me out.

So id just like to give my perspective on what I'm seeing on the charts. Its all in the eye of the beholder so take it as a grain of salt. This TA has helped me make money and, I believe, gives me an edge. But to each his own. If you are making money with your own method then congratulations. Not gonna poo all over you if it doesn't align with my method and strategies.

From the [5/21 read post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhrou0/i_spy_521_read/)

A few things in TA my notes:

* called support and resistance levels.
* Called small moves
* Called that bulls need to break 418 and test 418 as support. As you can see we failed bulls.
* But bears did not break 414.
* Also called out a 20 SMMA test. Which we tested and failed.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/vhi7x1l5or071.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b7f89491be4eb7f6ab15b0c4e8149d803ada9f0)

From the spot gamma notes:

* look at abs gamma strike and look what was said.

I'd like to address this chart and comment:

""Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.""

[ To express what I see I'll provide my chart:](https://preview.redd.it/0ghkrgvhkr071.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99e69494648928d9891cb025a1da6b33f94835f)

Let's go back to the 20th first.

* 20 SMMA acted as support and was tested three times throughout the day on the 20th.
* The 20 SMMA would have played as a great indicator to BTFD for Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/1dnhk0s0lr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0dc044b41db5df168ee01cf164486e120281a5

Now lets focus on friday:

* Still have the 20 smma as support in the morning
* broke through 418 with blow-off top but failed to establish support.
* Tested 20 SMMA support at around 8 AM and failed but found support at top of gap (pretty common).
* Tested 20 SMMA as support at 9 AM but failed
* 20 SMMA now acted as resistance from about 9:15 - 11:30 (two fucking hours) Scalpers delight! Easily a 1x-3x bagger on an O'Hare.
* As you can see we bounced off the 120 SMMA and found support.
* The essentially consolidated for the rest of the day. ""*Consolidation* is the term for a *stock* or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. *Consolidated stocks* typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few *trading* opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

Taking this comment into account: ""Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen.""

Let's look at the RSI at the blow off top.  If you started buying O'Hare calls here then you belong in this sub.

https://preview.redd.it/s2vvxf86vr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=eca2606d4187b2ff947c6d1cfbd713101b2d9d01

TLDR - use basic ta for support and resistance. Use more than one indicator to confirm trends. Read my posts as conditional statements. If you have questions - ask - BUT don't be a dick. I provide bullish and bearish pts because like everyone else I don't know where the market is going to go in the future. SMMAs are a great tool but not good used by themselves. Use them to determine strength of trends IMO. Use them for shorting and buying opportunities off of bounces and rejections.

On the 1H candles, break out over 50ma, resistance at 200ma, rsi peaking at 70, propably will come down to get support from 50ma again before breaking over the 200ma.

1. Successful test flight
2. Test flight delayed, again 
3. Unsuccessful test flight

587,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"**Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy every MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

https://preview.redd.it/z8gvmc77ml071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=7584983651d13d7a8304098dffcd011109fc12e3

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/aa8ly369ml071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=67b2c365b81e385f25387cee225ea73634f84126

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0
588,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"So first of all, Im not rich. I dont have 100 thousands of dollars. But if you only listen to rich people for advice, then this DD isnt for you. 

Edit: nice close at 19$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When fully operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. It will take time before they even sell half of that each year, so this is very good.



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Quebec will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Quebecker one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only local but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.

   * Suggests a positive outlook for the company as the price was bought above the price it was trading at then

# Industry Overview and Outlook

* Low-interest rates have fueled consumer demand for refinancing existing debt and access to new debt
* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs
   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending
* Strong economy coupled with strong employment numbers have led to a surge in home sales
   * Pandemic-drriven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

   * Approx. 79.3% growth since loan origination value of $41.4B from 2017
* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

Large open interest & volume on the June 18 expiration date, any reason why there's x10 times the normal open interest on the options expiring June 18? over 15M shares to cover options in the money as of today

GOLD is a good value company, with over 12B in revenue in 2020 & market cap is only 3.5x last year's revenue. Over 2B/yr in earnings the last 2 years & 5B in cash. Most of the business is in Gold mining 20% is in copper. Commodity prices keep climbing higher, so it's a good hedge for inflation.

For full disclosure I own several calls at the $20, $22, $23  expiring in June-Sept as well as shares of GOLD for the long to medium term. I'm no financial advisor and I'm likely wrong.

The stock has been seeing some resistance at $25 lately, but if the price of gold per ounce ($1881 currently) crosses the $1890... June is going to be a very good month for Barrick Gold. It's a quality company in my opinion & the market is at a tipping point, so it's a good safety net (maybe...)

$29 by end of summer? Would love to hear your thoughts

Demand has been extreme, they sell out immediately when they're available and cost 3-4x retail in used markets. Even though their cards are the strongest ray tracing cards in the market, their stock price hasn't moved since they released.

In the short term, there is a worldwide silicon shortage. NVidia needs to at least fulfill enough demand to meet earnings expectations. Since AMD, which is outperformed in ray tracing, killed earnings this quarter, NVidia will too.

In the long term, it will be open season for huge revenues from RTX 3000 sales as long as a superior line of GPUs doesn't release before the silicon shortage is dealt with.

If NVDA fulfills this huge GPU demand in the future, then their current price is a bargain.",ni8zp2,[],1

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

Stay safe & GLTA!

Edit: Additionally, in early February, Tilray announced it has established an agreement with **Grow Pharma** to import and distribute Tilray’s medical cannabis products into the [United Kingdom](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209005404/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Announces-Agreement-with-Grow-Pharma-to-Import-and-Distribute-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-the-United-Kingdom). This agreement allows Tilray to provide authorized UK patients in need with a locally maintained supply of medical cannabis solutions.

>This partnership with Grow Pharma provides patients in need access to a sustained supply of GMP-certified, high-quality medical cannabis and is an important step in improving access in the UK. Tilray will continue to advocate for reasonable patient access to medical cannabis in Europe and countries around the world

626,2021-05-22,wallstreetbets,"Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about *why* the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, *you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses.* Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit. Pricing sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. A lot of people who have the brainpower to price a stock don't have the conviction/temperament to stick by their call in the face of market swings. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

In any event, I have no actual point to this post, I just thought it was a really good insight. Go read his book!",niahr7,[],0
635,2021-05-22,wallstreetbets,"Hello,

I have been buying GME since May 2020. I currently have a 200k bet that GME goes up. I want the squeeze as much as anyone.

However, I feel like it is my duty to explain what is going on. The $10,000,000 share price is not going to happen. Whales want you to think it is possible so they can sell at $500 and there will be enough depth in the market to exit.

How can we know this for sure? The NYSE literally cannot quote stock prices that high. Furthermore, the SEC and politicians literally think it is their job to reduce market volatility. When Gme went to $300 the White House got involved, there is no way they will let it go to $10,000 - much less $10,000,000.

Think about it: would any president allow the economy to crash over a video game company? Right as midterms are heating up? No, the government will halt trading for days, or weeks, until a deal is brokered with GME directors. Ryan C may not want to issue more stock, but it will be the only way to avoid jail time for “stock manipulation”. If you don’t think the gov will send innocent ppl to jail, then you have not been paying attention.

The point of this post is not to make anyone sad or angry, it is to offer good trading advice. I see people breaking up with their loved ones, underperforming at work, or alienating others over this saga. Don’t do this. life is long and you do not want to trash what you have built bc you think one share of GME is a winning lotto ticket. 

Everyone has their own exit strategy. Don’t let anyone talk you out of making money. if you think this is FUD, then you really have fallen for the whales and you will be left holding our bags.

I wish the best to everyone here. Good luck: Buy, Hold, Vote and plan an exit strategy!

When these things happen, we get Inflation and maybe some time later rising interest rates (which usually dont even keep up with the devaluing of currency!). BUT additionally, asset and goods prices grow even more.

\- VSS Unity is in its launch configuration and pilots are readying the rocket motor system. Awaiting clearance for release from Mission Control.

\- Release, release, release! VSS Unity has successfully separated from VMS Eve.

\- VSS Unity’s rocket motor has been ignited by our pilots CJ Sturckow and Dave Mackay.

\- Rocket motor shutdown. Momentum will keep VSS Unity travelling upwards towards apogee.

\- VSS Unity enters coast phase. Tail-booms raised into “feathered” re-entry position.

\- VSS Unity, our two pilots and [NASA\_Technology](https://twitter.com/NASA_Technology) supported experiments are now in space.

\- VSS Unity reaches apogee.

\- VSS Unity is descending back to Earth.

\- The feather has been lowered and VSS Unity is now gliding smoothly back to the runway at Spaceport America.

So what’s next?
I think DraftKings is about to absolutely explode or die down to 30d SMA on the 2hr (~43.60) and then pop up. Either way this is looking extremely bullish.

I believe we’re going to break out of this current wedge and push to the 50d SMA on the weekly chart. There’s absolute no volume support above the current resistance point. We could essentially “gap” up to about ~49.5 and then trickle down to build consolidation and fill the volume support from 44.5-49.5.

It is an ancient concept almost as old as man himself. There has been nothing really new about inflation in the thousands of years of inflation’s history, and there still is not. Governments have been repeating the same mistake throughout history, sometimes leading to vicious cycles of hyperinflation. They have perpetually been rediscovering first the splendors and later the woes of inflation. Foolishly, each new government discovering this ” magic of money” seems to believe that no one has ever beheld such splendors before. The end result is always the same – the death of money.

Admittedly this is a long post, but we have to follow the thread of inflation throughout history to understand what is happening in the United States today. That is exactly what we will do. We will also look at one particular case where inflation never happened, the 2008 financial crisis. Later in the post, there is a comparison between what the Federal Reserve is doing today regarding the Covid-19 response stimulus package and the inflation trends throughout history. Finally, we will make our case why we believe that inflation is about to rise in the United States.

# In the beginning, was inflation

Money probably made its first appearance soon after the earliest caveman had his first successful hunt. Not long after he started hunting, he probably realized he could use animal skin as counters for trading spearheads and other goods with other cave dwellers. Anything like those animal skins with an accepted symbolic value, greater than its intrinsic value, was true money.

Because of human nature’s inherent yearning for more power and status, it probably did not take long for the smarter amongst the cavemen leaders to realize that controlling money was key to increasing his fortune. If he could decree what money was, then he could issue the money and gain political power. Not only that, but he could also benefit materially by exchanging money for things like spearheads and caves. We can speculate endlessly about what form the first money manifested in. It does not really matter. What is important is that the money manifested in a form that only the caveman leader could control. Probably something in the form of a specific animal’s skin that only he was allowed to hunt.

Along with a rising requirement for more caves and spearheads, the leader probably responded by hunting this exclusive animal more. As he hunted more, more animal skins became available, and the animal skins started losing their value as a means of trading. Undoubtedly, it did not take long for the price of spearheads and caves to rise in terms of animal skins. Buckled under the pressure of an oversupply of animal skin that was losing value, the subordinate cavemen experienced the first-ever inflation.

Not only was this the first example of inflation, but it was also the first example of government finance.

# Inflation through the ages

Man has evolved and progressed in many ways since the days we first left our caves. We landed on the moon and created the Higgs Boson collider. Yet, in contrast, there has been little progress in the area of inflation. In terms of inflation, there is nothing new under the sun. From the caveman beginnings to today, governments have perpetually rediscovered first the splendors and later inflation woes. This tragedy of the magic of money causing the death of money keeps on repeating itself in different forms. What follows here is a thread of inflation through history into the present day.

# The death of the Nummus (300 A.D)

&#x200B;

[Nummus Coins](https://preview.redd.it/0koiv421wp071.jpg?width=246&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b9a4fe807e5cb8dd78f714f1897f66b8dd555be)

One of the most violent and earliest forms of inflation occurred around the year 300 A.D. Not only was it a violent affair in terms of killing money. It also caused the death of hundreds of Romans in the form of the death penalty.

Nummi was a Roman empire era government-issued coin. It was made of copper washed with silver. The material to manufacture this coin was abundant across the Roman empire and, as a result, cheap to manufacture. As a natural consequence, the Roman empire, under Emperor Diocletian, produced more and more coins.

As more and more Nummi coins were produced, the Nummi started losing value. The price of goods and services began to rise. In response to this, the Emperor introduced strict price control measures in the form of price ceilings. Violators of the stipulated price ceilings would receive the death penalty. After inflicting many death penalties, the situation still did not improve. There were just too many Nummi in circulation, rendering it worthless. At some point, ordinary Romans preferred trading in items ranging from clay pottery to stones and ornaments instead of the Nummi. It is not the first time in history we will see basic elements like clay carrying more value than money. During the 1920s hyperinflation in Germany, it was cheaper to use paper money for making fires instead of purchasing firewood.

The result? The death of the Nummi. Throughout history, we will see the same pattern emerge where the “magic” of inflation leads to the death of money.

# Inflation through the centuries

So it has gone throughout man’s recorded history. Man has known inflation for centuries. Babylon and Ancient China both recorded inflations. The kings of England and France were inflationists, especially King Henry. The 1700s was characterized by worldwide inflation. The American Revolution and French revolution were the precursors of the paper printing mania of the 20th century. Throughout history, rising prices have been the rule and not the exception.

# The 1920 Germany hyperinflation

One of the well-known examples of hyperinflation is that of Weimar Germany in the 1920s. In the early 1920s, Germany was in a period of hyperinflation. In the end, the mark was worth only one trillionth of its original value. By November of 1923, the currency would depreciate to 4,200,000,000,000 marks to one US dollar.

Below are examples of 20,000,000, 50,000,000, 1,000,000,000, and 5,000,000,000 mark bills. At the time of hyperinflation, ordinary Germans would use notes like these to purchase basic goods like bread.

# The German inflation had its roots in World War I

Leading up to World War I, Germany decided to drop the gold standard. The gold-backed Reichsmark (or “Goldmark,” as it was referred to from 1914) became the unbacked Papermark. Initially, the Reich financed its war outlays in large part by issuing debt. Total public debt rose from 5.2bn Papermark in 1914 to 105.3bn in 1918. Germany hoped that it would quickly win the war and reap the bounty from the nations it conquered. Like all other governments before them, the Germans first discovered the splendors and later the woes of inflation.

During the war, the government used propaganda to hide the dire situation of the economy from the German public. Regardless of their propaganda attempts, the Germans could feel its detrimental effect in their daily lives. As a consequence, many soldiers deserted the war to head back home to support their families. In November 1918, things reached a boiling point. From all walks of life, Germans across the political spectrum united and took control of Germany’s cities. Furious at their material conditions, they demanded an end to the war. Kaiser Wilhelm II’s monarchy was toppled, and the war ended.

# The treaty of Versailles

The new Weimar Republic faced tremendous economic and political challenges. Already under pressure from internal crises, the treaty of Versailles just added more fuel to the fire.  According to the treaty, repatriations were to be repaid to the victorious allies. These repatriations were equivalent to half a trillion contemporary US dollars. The new and fledgling democratic government wanted to cater as best as possible to the wishes of their voters. For this reason, the government opted not to increase taxes too aggressively. As a result of this, tax revenues were insufficient to finance these outlays. Consequently, the Reichsbank (Germany’s central bank) started running the printing press.

# The result of the German hyperinflation

From April 1920 to March 1921, the ratio of tax revenues to debt amounted to just 37 percent. As the Reichsbank printed more currency to make up the difference, the rates worsened, and hyperinflation quickly reared its head. At its height, hyperinflation in Weimar Germany reached rates of more than 30,000% per month. To put this into context, one has to compare the price of eggs over time. In 1918, you could have bought 500 billion eggs for the same money you would have to spend five years later for just one egg. Essentially the money was worthless. Prices of goods and services doubled every few days. In fact, the money was worth less than firewood. Below are some historic photos from the time.

# How did the German hyperinflation end?

Hyperinflation has become untenable. Farmers refused to take any form of paper money for their crops. The harvest of 1923 sat in farmers’ warehouses while supermarkets in the cities were empty. As a result, starvation and civil unrest loomed.

On Oct. 15, 1923, the Rentenmark Ordinance was published. This paved the way for a new currency to be issued by a new institution, the Rentenbank. This new currency would be equivalent in value to the gold-linked prewar mark, or Rentenmark. At last, the printing of the now-defunct Papermarks ceased on November 15th. On Nov. 20. The devalued Papermark was pegged to the Rentenmark at a trillion to one. As a consequence, the hyperinflation ended, and Germany was back on a gold standard system.

Interestingly, the Rentenbank apparently held no gold bullion. Instead, the bank held mostly debt in mortgages on property and bonds on the German industry. Moreover, the Rentenmark was also not redeemable in gold. The main thing with the Rentenmark was that its value remained equivalent to gold. This was accomplished by reducing its issuance if any threat of its market value fell below that parity. The mechanism that cured the hyperinflation was the simple adjustment of supply.

# Lessons learned from the German hyperinflation.

The first lesson is that even a politically independent central bank does not provide reliable protection against the destruction of (paper) money. The Reichsbank had been made politically independent as early as 1922 already. This was a request on behalf of the allied forces as a service rendered. In return, they temporarily agreed to deferred reparation payments. Still, the Reichsbank council decided to hyperinflate the currency.

The second lesson is that fiat paper money won’t work without being backed by some standard. Throughout history, the gold standard proved to be a great inflationary measure control. Paper money is political money, and as such, it is a disruptive element in a system of free markets that does more good than harm.

*""Ensuring the possibility for redeeming in gold at any one time must be the endeavor of all issuers of paper money."" -* HJALMAR SCHACHT

Paper money, injected into the economy through bank credit, brings about a situation of over-indebtedness. The policy of choice to cure the remedy of over-indebtedness? Printing even more money. Undoubtedly, it is a vicious cycle.

The present-day United States has been using credit-produced paper monies for decades. Because of this, we can draw many interesting similarities between the United States and the Weimar republic. But first, we will examine why the 2008 financial crisis stimulus-response never caused any significant inflation.

# The inflation that never happened

Many analysts erroneously compare what is happening now in the United States with what happened in 2008. In reality, the two situations could not have been more different.

When central banks print money at a fever pitch, it does not necessarily mean that money ends up in the hands of people and businesses. 2008 is a classic example of this. The modus operandi of the FED is to issue money by purchasing Treasuries and Mortgage-backed loans from the banks. In turn, this money goes to the bank’s reserves that they can then lend out.

So what happened in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis? Instead of lending the money out, the banks hoarded the cash themselves in a desperate attempt at self-preservation. It is important to keep in mind the economic climate at the time. The 2008 financial crisis was spurred on by banks not having sufficient cash reserves, causing them to default. After Lehman Brothers went bust, banks started hoarding as many reserves as possible.

The consequence? Most of the money printed by the FED never ended up in the hands of the people. As a result, inflation never increased. The below graph illustrates the amount of paper money held as reserves by banks in the U.S. Notice the increase after 2008.

&#x200B;

# Why inflation in the U.S will rise

The reason is the same as all other inflation periods in history: too much money supply causing the currency to degenerate in value. A picture is worth a thousand words, and the below graph showing the money supply in the U.S economy shows it all.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hjpy98c3xp071.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=5061a190ad0c8388206b38a64e7e9dc7f9a7b8be

In 2020 alone, the Federal Reserve printed more than 20% of all dollars ever printed. Illustrated by the graph above, one can see why there is an increasing concern in this regard. The 2020 money supply dwarfs out even the 2008 financial crisis response. In context, 2008 was a previous money printing record and has already raised concerns back then. In 2020 the Federal Reserve printed more money than the last four years combined.

# Why the Covid-19 stimulus will cause the inflation

We already touched on the fact that most of the money printed by the FED in 2008 ended up being hoarded by the banks. As a result, very little of the 2008 response made it into the hands of people and businesses. The Covid-19 relief stimulus package is very different in two respects. The first is that banks can not hoard any more money. They have reached full capacity regarding what reserves they can store before running into liquidity crises themselves. This is alarming because the banks hoarding money in 2008 was the only thing standing between the FED and a rapid rise in inflation. The second reason is unlike in 2008, billions of dollars are injected into the real economy into the hands of businesses and people. This is the typical pattern that has caused inflation throughout history. In fact, there is no difference.

# Banks complain they have too much money now.

The modus operandi of the FED is not much different in terms of raising money than it was in 2008. They followed the same recipe. If it worked for them in 2008, why would it not work now? The problem is that banks have too much money now. It does not seem like something that would be a problem for most people. Why would anyone complain about having too much money, you might ask. We will cover that in detail. First, have a look at the scrapbook of newspaper articles touching on the same subject.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/be3qwedbxp071.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb5cbb9ae23b2bccbe9d13f70ef2bdd90981357

To understand why too much money is a bad thing for banks, we first have to explain the basic business model of banks. Banks make their money by accepting deposits and then lending out their reserves at an interest rate. In return, they also pay an interest rate to the depositor, albeit a lower rate.

With the FED printing and raising money to the extent they have, banks already sit with too many reserves. Adding to that, you have all the extra deposits coming in from people receiving stimulus packages. At the same time, there is less appetite for people taking out loans due to the uncertainty regarding Covid-19. Banks now sit with deposits they have to pay interest on. At the same time, they are not making money from it by lending it out. Whereas in 2008, the banks were propping up the reserves, they are now desperate to lend out money.

Of course, there are other dimensions to this problem, like minimum regulatory capital requirements for each $1 deposited. Having too many reserves can also lead to banks running into liquidity issues.

In short, banks can not take on any more money. If there is any more rapid financing resulting from the FED printing more money, it will push banks into having liquidity issues. Unlike 2008, banks are desperate to lend out money. Add this money supply originating from the bank lending to the $2 trillion already released into the economy due to the stimulus, and you have the perfect inflation storm.

# The similarities between the Covid-19 stimulus package and past inflations

All inflation cycles in the past followed the same pattern. First, a rapid increase in money supply followed by the splendor of economic growth and prosperity. That, in turn, is later followed by inflation, leading to the death of currencies.

We already covered the fact that the saving grace in 2008 was that banks absorbed most of the money raised. Very little of the money printed by the FED made it into the hands of people. The Covid-19 stimulus is very different in this regard. This time around, the U.S. stimulus package allocates more than $2 trillion to different groups in society, injecting money into the real economy. The breakdown is as follows:

* $560 billion to individuals
* $500 billion to large corporations
* $377 billion to small businesses
* $340 billion to state and local governments
* $154 billion for public health
* $44 billion for education and other causes

Not only that, together with the stimulus by the previous Trump administration, the total stimulus amounts to more than 27 percent of the U.S GDP. That’s nearly four times the share implemented in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

The only other country with a more aggressive stimulus response to the Covid-19 pandemic is Japan. We all know Japan is not really the poster child to follow when it comes to inflation. Japan has been struggling with deflation for more than two decades.

# Why we conclude inflation will rise in the U.S

There is nothing new in terms of inflation, from the days of our earliest ancestors to the present day. The magic of money causes the death of money. Every time in history where governments have resulted in printing more unbacked paper money to stimulate economies, inflation followed.

The one exception was 2008. The reason for that is that banks absorbed most of the money. As a result, most of the stimulus the money did not make it into the real economy. The Covid-19 stimulus package is different in this regard. First of all, the banks don’t have the capacity to absorb more money without running into liquidity issues themselves. The second and most important difference with 2008 is the injection of $2 trillion into different parts of the economy. This is the same classic example we have seen throughout history. Not much more needs to be said about that other than throughout history, where more money was injected into the economy at this scale, inflation always followed without fail.

* **Current support at 60 SMMA**
* **Current resistance at 20 SMMA**

When asked the detail they reply by some evasive way. Let's look at the a very widely mentioned TA indicator know as Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA). Note that depending on the trading platform it might have different name. Here is a 1-day chart with moving average indicators for 20-day and 60-day below. The frequency of the data points are set at 1 minute.

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(1-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators ](https://preview.redd.it/9pgrbjn05q071.jpg?width=1915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f791febda72367d086560c590f33d3b80556d5b2)

The blue line is indicating 20-day SMMA and the orange line is 60-day. I drew some lines to show short term trend by pink and cyan colors. If you look at the price action around the pink straight lines you see that SPY is below both lines that means none of the 60-day or 20-day SMMA is acting as support here. Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen. Or it might happens a lot and that's why these TA guys never post their gains along with time of buy and sell orders.

Now they might say, well 1-min will not work do it for 15 minutes or even 5 minutes. Let's see exactly the same SPY daily chart with 5-minutes frequency below-

Exactly the same chart with only difference is number of data points, which is smaller due to 5 minutes time interval. Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.   

Now look at the same chart with 15-minutes time interval below-

They might say you need to look at the RSI, MACD, BBW, CMO, CCI, KB, EMA, CADO, DSS, spotgamma, venna, chart etc. you know that they have no idea what they are talking.

655,2021-05-22,wallstreetbets,"We all know about the successful flight and everyone is expecting some moonage next week - so I just wanted to provide some **unbiased** TA. Keep in mind technicals are not a crystal ball, they are a **road map.** I do not hold a position *(although if I looked at the chart Friday, I would).*

[$SPCE 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/c32m1rk5eq071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d477968e5afc2875bca36a471e1c77bd84adcbd)

Here you can see we **broke out of a large descending wedge on Friday** (with fantastic volume). This is the same pattern damn near every speculative growth stock has been caught in for the past few months. Normally it has a bearish bias - because it is coming from downside. However, in this scenario - **it broke up -** which means **we can see some fantastic follow through to the upside.**

The price targets for this setup would be **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71.** These are all resistances - and in a normal situation you would either trim as we run into these, or scale in as we clear them.

However - given the news catalyst - it's hard to say how high we will gap up on Monday. Above that last level is **34.84** and **36.63.** It's unlikely we cross these without an insane short squeeze, or another pattern forming (at least on the shorter term charts).

Remember, each time we clear one of these levels on a **daily close -** it will become a support. As a result, you can trail your stop loss below them as we continue.

This is one of many examples of **""technicals precede news""** I have encountered throughout my trading career - and one of the reasons I try to ignore anything except for the charts while I am trading. It's hard to quantify arbitrary events - and especially hard to do so without bias. Thankfully, we will often **break out of a major pattern prior to a news release -** like you see here.

I'll be looking to day trade this stock next week depending where we open.

***TL;DR*** \- $SPCE broke out Friday & has positive news to help it along next week

Price targets are **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71**

EX dividend is literally 6/9 do you need to know anything else? This was made for WSB.

EDIT: I guess I have to do some real DD so automod doesn't ban me. Nobody reads that shit anyways.

Reasons this fucker is going to the moon:

1. They are the top mortgage lender... If you listened to their earnings call it was much different than RKT's. While RKT saw margins damper and guided down for the future, UWMC actually had a completely different tone. Margins were practically unaffected and they probably couldn't have given better guidance. TLDR: Rates go up we dominate competition and market share. Rates stay at these levels we continue to have massive revenues and return that money to the shareholders.
2. Next reason, they actually return money to shareholders! First year on the market and they already pay a dividend and have a massive share repurchase program in the works.
3. Now onto that share buyback program. They announced $300m of share repurchases.... for context when they announced that the entire float was worth $600m... you can see how this might affect price.
4. This company is making nearly 900m a quarter of NET INCOME and is priced at $12b... Show me where else you can find this in this market.
5. As you've already heard a million times by others Wall St is shorting the shit out of this thing for no apparent reason and you best believe they are doubling down after that run up and the recent fed comments on decreased house sales.

TLDR. UWMC going to the moon.... Way over shorted way under priced worst case scenario you are holding something that pays you every quarter and has a track record that lasts decades.

While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals® (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

· IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration – Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) – Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) – Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it. 

The chicken shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:    [Chlorinated chicken explained: why do the Americans treat their poultry with chlorine? | Analysis & Features | The Grocer](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/food-safety/chlorinated-chicken-explained-why-do-the-americans-treat-their-poultry-with-chlorine/555618.article) – The US Poultry Industry chlorinates chicken as a part of the disinfection process. 

This dependency on chlor alkali to fight COVID isn’t just happening in America. Below are links to numerous countries around the globe using chlorine and chlorine based products heavily to fight COVID.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

**DraftKings** is an American daily fantasy sports contest (dfs), sports betting operator (sportsbook), and virtual casino platform (igaming). Essentially it's a fucking money pit for retards who have gambling addictions, and according to a [Harvard Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230631/#:~:text=Based%20on%20its%20analysis%20of,activities%20in%20the%20past%20year) conducted in fucking 1997, approximately 1% of adults have gambling addictions, I'm sure with todays ease of access, it's more like 2%, so, \~6.6 million retards are at severe risk to giving DraftKings their bank accounts. Like I said, this shit is a money pit, they provide a service that results in LITERAL FREE MONEY. Instead of driving to a casino, these geniuses at DraftKings are allowing some individuals to gamble from the comfort of their couch, it's amazing. Also, when I say retards, take that lightly last Saturday, I gambled away, and streamed myself in an undisclosed off-brand WSB discord, $500 in an online casino, and gamble on sports, daily, hell, last NFL season I finished first in the r/sportsbook betting contest.

**SWOT ANALYSIS of Dick Kings**

**STRENGTHS:**

* Industry leaders: currently DKNG is legal in more [states](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/help/sports-betting/where-is-sports-betting-legal?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2Fhelp%2Fsports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal&wpcn=help&wpscn=sports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal) than any other sportsbook platform, they're legal in 11, with 2 on the brink of legalization, and a window of opportunity by eoy for the remaining 11 states where it is legal.
* Marketing/Advertising: if you're a sports guy, you'll noticed DKNG is fucking everywhere, you cant escape it. They're all over social media and are on every fucking commercial.  They spent 77% OF THEIR [REVENUE ON MARKETING PLATFORMS LMAO](https://www.actionnetwork.com/legal-online-sports-betting/draftkings-reports-increased-revenue-marketing-2020-earnings).
* Partnerships: They currently have a partnership with the NFL, UFC, MLB, three [NBA teams](https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/02/draftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F&wpcn=about&wpscn=news%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F), and they own a [Nascar](https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2021/05/20/draftkings-joins-nascar-star-bubba-wallace-23xi-racing/). Not only that, but Disney (ESPN) has a 6% stake in their company, yeah the largest sports network in America owns a [6% stake of DKNG.](https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17950769) (dont fuck with the mouse). They also have upcoming partnerships with Dish Network, and I'm sure they have a fuck ton of other promotions on the way.
* Ease of access: you literally type it in the browser, or download an app. Deposit you wage cuck check through paypal or via debit card and within 1 hour your entire check could be gone, it's that easy.
* UI: You know how everyone says, ""oh don't use robinhood, it's bad, it's so cancer, they sell your data."" Shut the fuck up, you know that UI is fucking sexy and that's why you keep buying FDs that's the same shit with DKNG. I've used hundreds of online casinos and sportsbook, personally bovada is my go to, but for legal books, DraftKings is by far the best, no question. That platform is sexy, look how clean this is compared to fanduel.

**WEAKNESSES:**

* They care too much, and try to hard to make as much money as possible? wtf? you thought imma drop actual weaknesses when Imma shill. No thanks LMAO. Fan Duel, Barstool sportsbook is straight trash. dafuq.

**OPPORTUNITIES:**

* State Legalizations, currently there are only 24 states where sportsbooks, igaming is legal, but it's expected to be legal nationwide in the next 1-3 years. Maryland, Nevada, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and New York are on the brink of having DKNG in their states. I know a few of those states legalize literally just last week.
* Partnerships, with the amount of money DraftKings is spending, they're going to have deals with the NHL, NBA and possibly even some college ball in the next few months. I wouldn't be surprised to see DKNG become the official sportsbook of the NFL in the future. I know a few [stadiums](https://www.giants.com/news/draftkings-and-new-york-giants-announce-official-exclusive-sports-betting-deal) offer DKNG sportsbook in stadium, and I think this will become the norm in the next few years. You'll be able to go to a ballpark, stadium and place your bet directly there right next to your $40 beer (cause inflation).
* Social Media. I think where it stands right now, if you google DraftKings, their social media platform is okay, but in the next few months, especially near NFL season, it'll absolutely explode. They obviously have a facebook, twitter accounts, instagram and they are extremely interactive, they have daily podcasts and shit, but that's all so new. Their accounts are all growing, and I know as their social media presence becomes established, their brand name will grow as well.
* Buyouts, again, as a I said above Disney has a 6% stake in DKNG, I wouldn't be surprised to see Disney too onto their ownership and possible even buyout Draft Kings, I mean, imagine that. Disney, ESPN and DraftKings, all under the same parent company. That would be insane. You don't see Barstool (Penn), or Fanduel with that kind of opportunity.
* Igaming, I think this platform is so slept on. Virtual casinos are the fucking future, let me tell you, I've been doing this shit for years and once you legal bros get into this shit, you'll be hooked. There's absolutely nothing better than sitting your fat ass on the couch and blowing through hundreds of dollars betting martingale on black 7 times in a row. SHIT IS FUCKING GREAT. If they can develop a strong Igaming presence, they'll be loaded. Igaming is \~$[250 billion industry](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/gaming-market-2020-2025-size-share-trends-growth-value-and-research-report-2021-03-03?tesla=y#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,Mobile)

**THREATS:**

* Their only threat is competition, which is actually a strength because their competition is dog water. Barstool Sports can't get a partnership with the largest revenue sport, the NFL, because the NFL commish Roger Goodell absolutely hates the face of Barstool, aka Portnoy. I love Portnoy, but guy is a week away from some fucked up-cocaine induced canceling, I'm telling you. Barstool will entertain the stoolies, but they'll never become the Mcdonalds of fastfood, they'll always be the fucking nasty ass trash Burger King that you have to go to because the Mcdonalds line is too long. Fanduel is owned by a UK company, what do they know about American sports. WHAT COMPETITION.

Their revenue has absolutely gone bananas in Q1, which is fucking insane, because there were some rumors that DKNG lost a fuck ton of money from the [superbowl](https://www.nhbr.com/the-brady-effect-new-hampshire-lottery-sacked-in-super-bowl-betting/#:~:text=State%20takes%20a%20%243%20million,the%20Bucs%20and%20their%20QB&text=While%20New%20Englanders%20bet%20heavily,hole%20on%20Super%20Bowl%20Sunday). Anyway, as you can see their revenue grew a dick-ton. The big scary here is their net is horrible, why, the big no no? Sales and Marketing. I was worried about that too, but that's their game plan, to a spend a fuck ton of money to game market dominance early on, retention rate is key to this industry. Jason Robbins their CEO said it on a [podcast the other day](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93aGVyZXRoZW1vbmV5aXMubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/Nzg3ZDM1Y2QtMTgxYS00ODBhLTllZGMtMzFmZDdlNWNlMTIx?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwisjdvGtt7wAhWKUt8KHVAoCCkQjrkEegQIBBAI&ep=6), they're in preseason, training camp in this market. They're still warming up to the full opportunity.

So to touch upon their spending again, as you can see their spending is working. They gained new degens at a rate of 114% compared to the first quarter of 2020. INSANE GROWTH. They're growing and retaining rates at a crazy level.

Look at the dates of filing and values. A lot of the media is shitting on Cathie Woods for buying DKNG religiously, but nobody is shitting on BlackRock for owning over 8million shares. As a wise man once told man, BlackRock is the United States testicles, they are the balls of this country. If they buy something, you know that shit is going to cum to the moon. It's insane how many of these big names are buying right now.

**Technical Analysis** so I hate to be the guy, but this is the [only stock I've traded all year](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/).

SHORT TERM(1-3 months):

[wedge, no vol.](https://preview.redd.it/eoqw7j1ocr071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=af1ced441b5aae74b9d3a8d6cd2a4f0db1c6e871)

As you can see from the chart above, we're currently trading in between the 7d sma and 50d sma on the 2hr. This is most likely complete confirmation bias, but I backed tested when DKNG has a daily closed inbetween this same crunch since it drooped the spac name, and whenever it has this same set up, these are the next day, and or two day returns.

02/10 +10.48% , 03/04 +13.89% , 03/25 +1.62% , 07/16 +9.46% , 09/09 +9.11% , 11/05 +9.05% , 1/08/21 +4.48% ,3/10/21 +11.48% , 04/26/21 +1.91%

Try it yourself. This is actually the reason why I bought weeklies eod friday. Check my positions at the top. I think in the next few weeks, DKNG will go to that top level resistance line at \~49.5, and then it could trade sideways for a bit longer to fill that volume gap from 44.5 to 49.5, but I do think a pump day is coming nonetheless.

LONG TERM(3-12 months):

[Support line](https://preview.redd.it/zdq66gyder071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=69931ee5a4f2a43686efeece722e3d70be27dd3f)

So, longterm (3-12 month window), referring to the chart at the top, it looks like DKNG has found support off the 35.5 bottom it hit in September, there's massive volume support at the 42.5 line, and that looks to be the new floor (god forbid a market crash happens soon, plz no fomc june 18th taper tantrum). It looks like the next major test for DKNG is at the 200d SMA or 51.52. If you look at RSI, it's leaving oversold territory, and MACD is flashing a reversal. I think we're due for a next wave of highs on DKNG. I could see this popping to \~49.5-51.5 -> \~60 -> all time highs. TA is looking dumb bullish fucking idiots. Buy this shit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 The 38-year-old AI coding genius, searching for ByteDance’s next big act, has set his sights on China’s $1.7 trillion e-commerce arena. The co-founder has hired thousands of staff and roped in big-name sponsors like Xiaomi Corp. impresario Lei Jun to drive what he calls his next “major breakthrough” into global business -- selling stuff to consumers via its addictive short videos and livestreams.

Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

First off, if you've been living under a rock and don't know what Alibaba is, here's a video about what the company does from CNN Business. [https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness)

Alibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 6 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I took notice when these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that environmentally sustainable (basically they just monitor their carbon footprint), something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yen (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, roughly 10% off it's 52 week low.

Now what REALLY turned my head was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO. For Munger, one of THE most risk-adverse investors in history, to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

Since Munger's position was revealed, Reddit users took notice and has become the most talked about undervalued stock on Reddit.

671,2021-05-23,wallstreetbets,"This asshat started tolling on my post (my perspective): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i\_spy\_521\_recap\_and\_524\_outlook/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i_spy_521_recap_and_524_outlook/)

And then called me out in a post - without calling me out. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical\_analysis\_on\_smoothed\_moving\_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical_analysis_on_smoothed_moving_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3)

So id just like to give my perspective on what I'm seeing on the charts. Its all in the eye of the beholder so take it as a grain of salt. This TA has helped me make money and, I believe, gives me an edge. But to each his own. If you are making money with your own method then congratulations. Not gonna poo all over you if it doesn't align with my method and strategies.

From the [5/21 read post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhrou0/i_spy_521_read/)

A few things in TA my notes:

* called support and resistance levels.
* Called small moves
* Called that bulls need to break 418 and test 418 as support. As you can see we failed bulls.
* But bears did not break 414.
* Also called out a 20 SMMA test. Which we tested and failed.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/vhi7x1l5or071.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b7f89491be4eb7f6ab15b0c4e8149d803ada9f0)

From the spot gamma notes:

* look at abs gamma strike and look what was said.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/j6xkdqb9pr071.png?width=1398&format=png&auto=webp&s=df15d5b87b146ca6cdf391dbc9fada46db89a1b2)

I'd like to address this chart and comment:

""Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.""

[ To express what I see I'll provide my chart:](https://preview.redd.it/0ghkrgvhkr071.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99e69494648928d9891cb025a1da6b33f94835f)

Let's go back to the 20th first.

* 20 SMMA acted as support and was tested three times throughout the day on the 20th.
* The 20 SMMA would have played as a great indicator to BTFD for Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/1dnhk0s0lr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0dc044b41db5df168ee01cf164486e120281a5

Now lets focus on friday:

* Still have the 20 smma as support in the morning
* broke through 418 with blow-off top but failed to establish support.
* Tested 20 SMMA support at around 8 AM and failed but found support at top of gap (pretty common).
* Tested 20 SMMA as support at 9 AM but failed
* 20 SMMA now acted as resistance from about 9:15 - 11:30 (two fucking hours) Scalpers delight! Easily a 1x-3x bagger on an O'Hare.
* As you can see we bounced off the 120 SMMA and found support.
* The essentially consolidated for the rest of the day. ""*Consolidation* is the term for a *stock* or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. *Consolidated stocks* typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few *trading* opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

https://preview.redd.it/7y89c2awqr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=83d8c18d5dcf4bd08b12a1ac9e0cb00c0ee9d107

Taking this comment into account: ""Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen.""

Let's look at the RSI at the blow off top.  If you started buying O'Hare calls here then you belong in this sub.

https://preview.redd.it/s2vvxf86vr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=eca2606d4187b2ff947c6d1cfbd713101b2d9d01

TLDR - use basic ta for support and resistance. Use more than one indicator to confirm trends. Read my posts as conditional statements. If you have questions - ask - BUT don't be a dick. I provide bullish and bearish pts because like everyone else I don't know where the market is going to go in the future. SMMAs are a great tool but not good used by themselves. Use them to determine strength of trends IMO. Use them for shorting and buying opportunities off of bounces and rejections.

918,2021-05-23,wallstreetbets,"So I may or may not have been smoking weed when this idea came to me, but I was sober when I bought 4K in options for these space etfs.  I had the revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector.  Increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I sobered up.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report.  However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  Many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.

1146,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"**Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy every MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

https://preview.redd.it/z8gvmc77ml071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=7584983651d13d7a8304098dffcd011109fc12e3

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/aa8ly369ml071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=67b2c365b81e385f25387cee225ea73634f84126

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0

- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When fully operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. It will take time before they even sell half of that each year, so this is very good.



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Quebec will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Quebecker one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only local but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

1598,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"**Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy every MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

https://preview.redd.it/z8gvmc77ml071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=7584983651d13d7a8304098dffcd011109fc12e3

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/aa8ly369ml071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=67b2c365b81e385f25387cee225ea73634f84126

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution.

1. Successful test flight
2. Test flight delayed, again 
3. Unsuccessful test flight

2174,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"**Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy every MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

https://preview.redd.it/z8gvmc77ml071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=7584983651d13d7a8304098dffcd011109fc12e3

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/aa8ly369ml071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=67b2c365b81e385f25387cee225ea73634f84126

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0
2175,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"So first of all, Im not rich. I dont have 100 thousands of dollars. But if you only listen to rich people for advice, then this DD isnt for you. 

Edit: nice close at 19$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When fully operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. It will take time before they even sell half of that each year, so this is very good.



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Quebec will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Quebecker one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only local but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

2177,2021-05-23,wallstreetbets,"One piece of news about United Wholesale Mortgage that has mostly gone under the radar is that UWMC will be included in the **MSCI World Small-Cap Index** starting on May 27. This has potential to be a significant catalyst next week, and I will lay out the reasons why here.

The list of new additions/deletions to this index can be found in the link to “MSCI Small Cap Indexes List of Additions/Deletions” on [this page](https://www.msci.com/index-review). UWMC appears on page 12 of this document as **“UWM HLDGS A”**. 

There is understandably some skepticism involved in regards to UWM and indexes after the fiasco with the Russell 1000 inclusion back in March. The blame for that mistake rests fully with FTSE Russell, as individual companies have no say on their inclusion or exclusion from the published lists. FTSE mistakenly added UWMC to the Q1 *preliminary* IPO addition list, and then later did not include it in the final list after realizing that by their own rules they do not include SPACs and a SPAC merger does not count as an IPO. But some key differences exist here with the MSCI Index.

First, the list published by MSCI is already the *final* list. It’s a done deal that UWMC will be in the MSCI index, it simply has to go into effect officially at the close of market on May 27. The other key difference, and **one which could potentially make this MSCI index inclusion a** ***meaningfully*** **greater catalyst** than UWMC’s June inclusion in the Russell 1000 index (for real this time), is the fact that UWMC is being listed in the *small-cap index*.

Why is it beneficial for UWMC to go in the *small-cap* index? It has to do with relative weighting within the index. Companies are ranked and weighted based on their relative market cap sizes within the index. The higher ranked companies get a higher weighting and thus make up a relatively larger percentage of the index. For example, the top holding in the MSCI World Small Cap Index is CZR which has a weight of 0.23% of the index. This means that any funds that track this index would have to purchase enough shares of CZR such that the stock makes up 0.23% of the total assets of the fund.

So how is this bullish for UWMC? Because when UWMC is added to the index, it will likely be one of the **top ten in ranking** (or just outside the top ten) based on its current market cap. [This page](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) from BlackRock’s iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF shows the top ten ranked holdings. TPR is the 9th company in this list (top is cash) as of May 20, 2021, with a relative weighting of 0.16%. As of the close of market Friday, TPR has a market cap of just under $12 Billion. In comparison, UWMC closed Friday with a higher market cap of $12.95 Billion. So this means that upon official inclusion, UWMC should be ranked right around the 10th place position, which should **give it a weighting of approximately 0.16%**.

This allows us to then calculate the approximate number of shares of UWMC that funds tracking the MSCI World Small-Cap Index will need to purchase when it is officially added. I found three main ETFs that track this index. There are likely other funds, but these three are sufficient I believe to make the case for why this is a meaningful catalyst.

>[BlackRock iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) \- Net Assets $4.12 Billion  
>  
>0.16% \* $4.12 Billion = $6.59 Million, corresponding to 816,800 shares @ $8.07.  
>  
>[Vanguard Global Small-Cap Index Fund](https://markets.ft.com/data/funds/tearsheet/summary?s=IE00B42LF923:USD) \- Net Assets $3.69 Billion  
>  
>0.16% \* $3.69 Billion = $5.9 Million, corresponding to 731,600 shares @ $8.07.  
>  
>[SPDR MSCI World Small Cap ETF](https://www.ssga.com/uk/en_gb/institutional/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-zprs-gy) \- Net Assets $950 Million  
>  
>0.16% \* $950 Million = $1.52 Million, corresponding to 188,350 shares @ $8.07.

In comparison, when UWMC is added to the Russell 1000, it will be ranked right around 550th place based on its current market cap, giving it a weighting of 0.03%. It’s inclusion in the Russell will still be a positive thing, given that there are many more funds that track the Russell than the MSCI index. But because of the 5.3x higher weighting that UWMC will have in the MSCI index, this gives its inclusion some significant OOMPH (legitimate financial term). [Studies have shown](https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion) that when a stock moves from the Russell 1000 down to the Russell 2000 due to a reduction in its market cap, the share price tends to move *up* shortly thereafter, because now it is one of the top companies in its respective index (with a higher respective weighting) rather than one of the smallest.

TL;DR: it is better to be a BIG fish in a ^(small) (cap) index than to be a small fish in a large index. Thus, I believe we can anticipate good things ahead with UWMC’s inclusion in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index.",nj0cj6,[],1

2665,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"**Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy every MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/aa8ly369ml071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=67b2c365b81e385f25387cee225ea73634f84126

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do.

2877,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"So first of all, Im not rich. I dont have 100 thousands of dollars. But if you only listen to rich people for advice, then this DD isnt for you. 

Edit: nice close at 19$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When fully operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. It will take time before they even sell half of that each year, so this is very good.



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Quebec will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Quebecker one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only local but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

*Processing img ovwzb6reit071...*

Listen up fellow retards, while the alpha apes are busy ravaging $GME generally shitting on short sellers I would like to take a break and share with you why Square, Inc ($SQ) fucks.

**TL;DR TL;DR**

* Buy $SQ and hold 💰
* Don't complain about my spelling, grammar or run on sentences. 🏃‍♂️  
 

**TL;DR**

* $SQ investing 100mm into Tidal
* $SQ absolutely CRUSHED earnings (EST 0.16 / ACT 0.41)
* loyalty program focused across consumer/commercial ecosystem
* Tidal acquisition positions Square in a way that allows the creation of a new marketplace  
 

**The DD:**

Square, Inc is a payment processor and gateway.

Square, Inc owns CashApp which is a mobile payment service

Square, Inc recently purchased a controlling share of Tidal which is a subscription-based music, podcast and video streaming serviceSquare is on sale right now, below the previous $205 resistance.

**The Fast Rise:**

Like most other tech companies mid-pandemic, SQ exhibited great growth in the months leading up to it's slide. Just look at this rock solid climb

 

[$SQ generating tendies](https://preview.redd.it/8i7qkg1aht071.png?width=3502&format=png&auto=webp&s=0169592f440463032f24306e967116d1b3a389dd)

To be fair, this wasn't just tech stock bubble shit, there was real growth and numbers behind $SQ (and other similar stocks like $SHOP) with pandemic usage skyrocketing. CashApp also saw a massive increase in usage due to many new users wanting to buy ""alternative currencies"". Things were going great for SQ on the road to $300

**A Slow Decent:**

$SQ tried the $275 resistance line a few times, but just couldn't seem to stay above it (reminds me of BofA and that mythical $40)

Amidst all this crys poppin\` and wrist watches, the outside influence begins.Looking at the 1 year chart, this was around same time that Citadel & others started selling stock assets to cover their retarded plays. It was also around the time ""alternative currencies"" began sliding. Volume on sells picked up drastically as money was moved to cover loses. $SQ starts trading sideways and it's shit got all retarded 

&#x200B;

[Actual quote from $SQ BoD](https://preview.redd.it/3ntdnmslht071.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bda96e0b2bf74d6a2741457c7f3d247e384be81)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* Poppa Elon said what he said about ""alternative currencies"" 📉 
* People seemed confused AF about the Tidal deal 📉
* People thought it was retarded to add Jay Z to the board 📉

All of this leads up to $SQ being below its $205 resistance for the first time this year. 🏷

&#x200B;

**The Rub:**

Why does Square want to get into the media streaming game you ask? They don't....

They want to get into the distribution game and take a rip of all royalties in the process. On-top of that, they want to create a fully autonomous market between artists and fans.

Listening to the latest Q1 2021 earnings call a few major take aways:

&#x200B;

* Seller (register) side gross profit - 460m (+32%)
* CashApp gross profit - 495m (+171%)
* Increased 2021 Investment plan to 1.1b (+200m)
* Focused on ecosystem synergy
* A large portion of that R&D money is going to Tidal
   * Square wants to make it easy for independent artists to get paid for their work
   * Multiple pre-existing ""ecosystems"" in CashApp help support this pivot
* Early integration vision for Tidal realized with 2021 investment budget increase  
 

Tidal will aim to allow independent artists to upload their own music to Tidal and get paid utilizing existing Square Inc infrastructure. Tidal will effectively act as a distributor for the artist. Couple this with Square's knowledge and experience in alternative payment game and you have a recipe for future platform growth.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

Square has learned a ton of things about the challenges facing small business and money flow. They will use this knowledge to build Tidal into a distribution hub for Artists. They will be able to tap into the existing Square ecosystem for payment processing and use the existing CashApp ecosystem to make it easy to connect artists with their fans. 

They will do all of this, while also focusing on creating synergy between the Square Register (sales) and CashApp (payment app) ecosystems and directed towards creating an independent

2. Fed admits inflation may not be transitory

From fed : A number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and, if so, these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year.

Here is the Chinese offical goverment stance for Gold and silver from the following article so obvious . This is the first time saw that kind of bullish news . especially important that this news from Chinese official goverment declaration

[https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1224071.shtml](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1224071.shtml)

Social media platform some users call for switch to Gold which they said was more stable.

""I still expect a good gold price performance,"" he said, noting that investing in gold is convenient, while there is no formal way to invest in other assets .

Music stopped ! for gold and silver alternatives .

5.USD index ( DXY) breaking ;

One of the drivers for the next strong move up in silver will be the USD index (DXY) breaking below the Feb '18 low of 88.15 and descending into its 3yr cycle low. It is currently on calendar day 84 of the current intermediate cycle. They usual run 160-280 calendar days.

&#x200B;

 CPI inflation index is a poor historical tracker of the gold price. The pink dashed line below shows the cycle high price of $35/oz price from 1934 projected forward using CPI scaling. Clearly, M2 scaling with a mine-supply discount tracks the gold price much better.

Once this is all behind us, there should be a strong move up in gold into the summer. After that, I would expect the next big move in gold to be a push up to \~$3000 by mid-2022 .

7. Gold /silver Ratio :

So silver will lead the metals and the gold/silver ratio, now at 67, will initially reach 30 like. The long term target is likely to be a lot lower, probably 15 or below. As talked before the expected Gold prices 3.000 usd in the mid of 2022 and with gold /silver ratio we can expect price range 150 -200 Usd /ozz which is x8 gain from actual 27.6 usd /ozz price .

&#x200B;

 

Now our tickets :

1. Physical Silver bars coins , or other stuff just as an example : The premiums are sky high so it is over . Spot at $28.15. Some internet sites  selling eagles for $44.28. Either something big is coming and they know it or someone selling this to you is wearing a ski mask. Either way, not sure why you would buy this product at this price.
2. PSLV Reaches $4 BILLION in Assets! 144,213,789 total ounces of Physical Silver  
53 million ounces of physical silver added in 2021 . Actually now only feasible alternative . Fully liquid and buy and sell in a second and also hedge yourself .
3. ZSİL ( swiss ) , or other European allocated ETFS .

My position : I have 1.700 ozz of physical silver

Nothing here is financial advice ............................................

Loves you all although got many negative comments and I want all you see this opportunity . Even mosts are not in . At leaast 5 /10 % add to your portfolio and play your usual stock or option games .

5497,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"**Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy every MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/aa8ly369ml071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=67b2c365b81e385f25387cee225ea73634f84126

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do.

5634,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"So first of all, Im not rich. I dont have 100 thousands of dollars. But if you only listen to rich people for advice, then this DD isnt for you. 

Edit: nice close at 19$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When fully operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. It will take time before they even sell half of that each year, so this is very good.



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Quebec will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Quebecker one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only local but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do.

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When fully operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. It will take time before they even sell half of that each year, so this is very good.



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Quebec will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Quebecker one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only local but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

You can find the last week's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nds2vh/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/rc961bm4hv071.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4701a99fd4471a560552f895ebcc817e72e334d3

GME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \[Redacted\] as a payment option.

Newcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \[redacted\], a new \[redacted\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.

**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker’s Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it’s slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.

**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford’s CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

The way I see it is there is no way that the price of SPCE will stay the same from today going into Monday. 

One of three options are going to play out.

1. Successful test flight
2. Test flight delayed, again 
3. Unsuccessful test flight

Regardless of the situation, the needle is going to move a LOT. How are you playing this rocket ride? 

I have a few 17p and 16p expiring Monday and a few HUGELY OTM calls expiring next Friday. I’m more expecting a total failure, but on the off chance it’s a huge success those calls are going to print.

What are y’all’s positions?

And to all the people saying you wouldn’t touch SPCE with a 40 foot pole, why? The stock is going to move one way or another and if you’re really that against it, buy puts and put your Twitter fingers to work.

The electric vehicle (EV) space, there are multiple stocks from which to choose that have the potential to deliver exponential gains over the long term. Tesla (TSLA) remains the market leader in the EV segment. However, this disruptive industry is attracting capital from retail and institutional investors because it is expandingÂ  rapidly.

6322,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"**Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy every MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/aa8ly369ml071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=67b2c365b81e385f25387cee225ea73634f84126

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When fully operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. It will take time before they even sell half of that each year, so this is very good.



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Quebec will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Quebecker one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only local but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

   * Suggests a positive outlook for the company as the price was bought above the price it was trading at then

# Industry Overview and Outlook

* Low-interest rates have fueled consumer demand for refinancing existing debt and access to new debt
* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs
   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending
* Strong economy coupled with strong employment numbers have led to a surge in home sales
   * Pandemic-drriven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006
   * 5.6% increase YoY for homes sold

   * Approx. 79.3% growth since loan origination value of $41.4B from 2017
* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

It's rather shocking to me that most people have never heard of Anktiva in the biotech Market space. Basically, a sleeper drug from IBRX. Remember when Keytruda was a sleeper drug for Merck? Keytruda probably the most valuable drug in all of biotech now. Seems like Anktiva will be a new cancer drug for a wide range of cancers. Not just one type but mutliple types of cancers. With minimal side-effects, Anktiva will be approved after a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in a phase 3 study by the FDA. But apparently, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. It's gonna be synonymous with cancer drug names like Keytruda. Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda). Crazy man. Y'all are crazy for not seeing what I'm seeing.

Demand has been extreme, they sell out immediately when they're available and cost 3-4x retail in used markets. Even though their cards are the strongest ray tracing cards in the market, their stock price hasn't moved since they released.

In the short term, there is a worldwide silicon shortage. NVidia needs to at least fulfill enough demand to meet earnings expectations. Since AMD, which is outperformed in ray tracing, killed earnings this quarter, NVidia will too.

In the long term, it will be open season for huge revenues from RTX 3000 sales as long as a superior line of GPUs doesn't release before the silicon shortage is dealt with.

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

Recent interview with Irwin & Merton discussing the synergies between Aphria/Tilray:

Stay safe & GLTA!

Edit: Additionally, in early February, Tilray announced it has established an agreement with **Grow Pharma** to import and distribute Tilray’s medical cannabis products into the [United Kingdom](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209005404/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Announces-Agreement-with-Grow-Pharma-to-Import-and-Distribute-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-the-United-Kingdom). This agreement allows Tilray to provide authorized UK patients in need with a locally maintained supply of medical cannabis solutions.

>This partnership with Grow Pharma provides patients in need access to a sustained supply of GMP-certified, high-quality medical cannabis and is an important step in improving access in the UK. Tilray will continue to advocate for reasonable patient access to medical cannabis in Europe and countries around the world

8385,2021-05-22,wallstreetbets,"Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about *why* the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, *you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses.* Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit. Pricing sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. A lot of people who have the brainpower to price a stock don't have the conviction/temperament to stick by their call in the face of market swings. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

In any event, I have no actual point to this post, I just thought it was a really good insight. Go read his book!",niahr7,[],0
8394,2021-05-22,wallstreetbets,"Hello,

I have been buying GME since May 2020. I currently have a 200k bet that GME goes up. I want the squeeze as much as anyone.

However, I feel like it is my duty to explain what is going on. The $10,000,000 share price is not going to happen. Whales want you to think it is possible so they can sell at $500 and there will be enough depth in the market to exit.

How can we know this for sure? The NYSE literally cannot quote stock prices that high. Furthermore, the SEC and politicians literally think it is their job to reduce market volatility. When Gme went to $300 the White House got involved, there is no way they will let it go to $10,000 - much less $10,000,000.

Think about it: would any president allow the economy to crash over a video game company? Right as midterms are heating up? No, the government will halt trading for days, or weeks, until a deal is brokered with GME directors. Ryan C may not want to issue more stock, but it will be the only way to avoid jail time for “stock manipulation”. If you don’t think the gov will send innocent ppl to jail, then you have not been paying attention.

The point of this post is not to make anyone sad or angry, it is to offer good trading advice. I see people breaking up with their loved ones, underperforming at work, or alienating others over this saga. Don’t do this. life is long and you do not want to trash what you have built bc you think one share of GME is a winning lotto ticket. 

Everyone has their own exit strategy. Don’t let anyone talk you out of making money. if you think this is FUD, then you really have fallen for the whales and you will be left holding our bags.

I wish the best to everyone here. Good luck: Buy, Hold, Vote and plan an exit strategy!

When these things happen, we get Inflation and maybe some time later rising interest rates (which usually dont even keep up with the devaluing of currency!). BUT additionally, asset and goods prices grow even more.

So what’s next?
I think DraftKings is about to absolutely explode or die down to 30d SMA on the 2hr (~43.60) and then pop up. Either way this is looking extremely bullish.

I believe we’re going to break out of this current wedge and push to the 50d SMA on the weekly chart. There’s absolute no volume support above the current resistance point. We could essentially “gap” up to about ~49.5 and then trickle down to build consolidation and fill the volume support from 44.5-49.5. This a 100 stock in a year no question, but the short term pop is the play.

8409,2021-05-22,wallstreetbets,"We all have some basic idea of inflation—the rise in the price of goods over time. Inflation is a very, very old concept. It is an ancient concept almost as old as man himself. There has been nothing really new about inflation in the thousands of years of inflation’s history, and there still is not. Governments have been repeating the same mistake throughout history, sometimes leading to vicious cycles of hyperinflation. They have perpetually been rediscovering first the splendors and later the woes of inflation. Foolishly, each new government discovering this ” magic of money” seems to believe that no one has ever beheld such splendors before. The end result is always the same – the death of money.

Admittedly this is a long post, but we have to follow the thread of inflation throughout history to understand what is happening in the United States today. That is exactly what we will do. We will also look at one particular case where inflation never happened, the 2008 financial crisis. Later in the post, there is a comparison between what the Federal Reserve is doing today regarding the Covid-19 response stimulus package and the inflation trends throughout history. Finally, we will make our case why we believe that inflation is about to rise in the United States.

# In the beginning, was inflation

Money probably made its first appearance soon after the earliest caveman had his first successful hunt. Not long after he started hunting, he probably realized he could use animal skin as counters for trading spearheads and other goods with other cave dwellers. Anything like those animal skins with an accepted symbolic value, greater than its intrinsic value, was true money.

Because of human nature’s inherent yearning for more power and status, it probably did not take long for the smarter amongst the cavemen leaders to realize that controlling money was key to increasing his fortune. If he could decree what money was, then he could issue the money and gain political power. Not only that, but he could also benefit materially by exchanging money for things like spearheads and caves. We can speculate endlessly about what form the first money manifested in. It does not really matter. What is important is that the money manifested in a form that only the caveman leader could control. Probably something in the form of a specific animal’s skin that only he was allowed to hunt.

Along with a rising requirement for more caves and spearheads, the leader probably responded by hunting this exclusive animal more. As he hunted more, more animal skins became available, and the animal skins started losing their value as a means of trading. Undoubtedly, it did not take long for the price of spearheads and caves to rise in terms of animal skins. Buckled under the pressure of an oversupply of animal skin that was losing value, the subordinate cavemen experienced the first-ever inflation.

Not only was this the first example of inflation, but it was also the first example of government finance.

# Inflation through the ages

Man has evolved and progressed in many ways since the days we first left our caves. We landed on the moon and created the Higgs Boson collider. Yet, in contrast, there has been little progress in the area of inflation. In terms of inflation, there is nothing new under the sun. From the caveman beginnings to today, governments have perpetually rediscovered first the splendors and later inflation woes. This tragedy of the magic of money causing the death of money keeps on repeating itself in different forms. What follows here is a thread of inflation through history into the present day.

# The death of the Nummus (300 A.D)

&#x200B;

[Nummus Coins](https://preview.redd.it/0koiv421wp071.jpg?width=246&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b9a4fe807e5cb8dd78f714f1897f66b8dd555be)

One of the most violent and earliest forms of inflation occurred around the year 300 A.D. Not only was it a violent affair in terms of killing money. It also caused the death of hundreds of Romans in the form of the death penalty.

Nummi was a Roman empire era government-issued coin. It was made of copper washed with silver. The material to manufacture this coin was abundant across the Roman empire and, as a result, cheap to manufacture. As a natural consequence, the Roman empire, under Emperor Diocletian, produced more and more coins.

As more and more Nummi coins were produced, the Nummi started losing value. The price of goods and services began to rise. In response to this, the Emperor introduced strict price control measures in the form of price ceilings. Violators of the stipulated price ceilings would receive the death penalty. After inflicting many death penalties, the situation still did not improve. There were just too many Nummi in circulation, rendering it worthless. At some point, ordinary Romans preferred trading in items ranging from clay pottery to stones and ornaments instead of the Nummi. It is not the first time in history we will see basic elements like clay carrying more value than money. During the 1920s hyperinflation in Germany, it was cheaper to use paper money for making fires instead of purchasing firewood.

The result? The death of the Nummi. Throughout history, we will see the same pattern emerge where the “magic” of inflation leads to the death of money.

# Inflation through the centuries

So it has gone throughout man’s recorded history. Man has known inflation for centuries. Babylon and Ancient China both recorded inflations. The kings of England and France were inflationists, especially King Henry. The 1700s was characterized by worldwide inflation. The American Revolution and French revolution were the precursors of the paper printing mania of the 20th century. Throughout history, rising prices have been the rule and not the exception.

# The 1920 Germany hyperinflation

One of the well-known examples of hyperinflation is that of Weimar Germany in the 1920s. In the early 1920s, Germany was in a period of hyperinflation. In the end, the mark was worth only one trillionth of its original value. By November of 1923, the currency would depreciate to 4,200,000,000,000 marks to one US dollar.

Below are examples of 20,000,000, 50,000,000, 1,000,000,000, and 5,000,000,000 mark bills. At the time of hyperinflation, ordinary Germans would use notes like these to purchase basic goods like bread.

# The German inflation had its roots in World War I

Leading up to World War I, Germany decided to drop the gold standard. The gold-backed Reichsmark (or “Goldmark,” as it was referred to from 1914) became the unbacked Papermark. Initially, the Reich financed its war outlays in large part by issuing debt. Total public debt rose from 5.2bn Papermark in 1914 to 105.3bn in 1918. Germany hoped that it would quickly win the war and reap the bounty from the nations it conquered. Like all other governments before them, the Germans first discovered the splendors and later the woes of inflation.

During the war, the government used propaganda to hide the dire situation of the economy from the German public. Regardless of their propaganda attempts, the Germans could feel its detrimental effect in their daily lives. As a consequence, many soldiers deserted the war to head back home to support their families. In November 1918, things reached a boiling point. From all walks of life, Germans across the political spectrum united and took control of Germany’s cities. Furious at their material conditions, they demanded an end to the war. Kaiser Wilhelm II’s monarchy was toppled, and the war ended.

# The treaty of Versailles

The new Weimar Republic faced tremendous economic and political challenges. Already under pressure from internal crises, the treaty of Versailles just added more fuel to the fire.  According to the treaty, repatriations were to be repaid to the victorious allies. These repatriations were equivalent to half a trillion contemporary US dollars. The new and fledgling democratic government wanted to cater as best as possible to the wishes of their voters. For this reason, the government opted not to increase taxes too aggressively. As a result of this, tax revenues were insufficient to finance these outlays. Consequently, the Reichsbank (Germany’s central bank) started running the printing press.

# The result of the German hyperinflation

From April 1920 to March 1921, the ratio of tax revenues to debt amounted to just 37 percent. As the Reichsbank printed more currency to make up the difference, the rates worsened, and hyperinflation quickly reared its head. At its height, hyperinflation in Weimar Germany reached rates of more than 30,000% per month. To put this into context, one has to compare the price of eggs over time. In 1918, you could have bought 500 billion eggs for the same money you would have to spend five years later for just one egg. Essentially the money was worthless. Prices of goods and services doubled every few days. In fact, the money was worth less than firewood. Below are some historic photos from the time.

# How did the German hyperinflation end?

Hyperinflation has become untenable. Farmers refused to take any form of paper money for their crops. The harvest of 1923 sat in farmers’ warehouses while supermarkets in the cities were empty. As a result, starvation and civil unrest loomed.

On Oct. 15, 1923, the Rentenmark Ordinance was published. This paved the way for a new currency to be issued by a new institution, the Rentenbank. This new currency would be equivalent in value to the gold-linked prewar mark, or Rentenmark. At last, the printing of the now-defunct Papermarks ceased on November 15th. On Nov. 20. The devalued Papermark was pegged to the Rentenmark at a trillion to one. As a consequence, the hyperinflation ended, and Germany was back on a gold standard system.

Interestingly, the Rentenbank apparently held no gold bullion. Instead, the bank held mostly debt in mortgages on property and bonds on the German industry. Moreover, the Rentenmark was also not redeemable in gold. The main thing with the Rentenmark was that its value remained equivalent to gold. This was accomplished by reducing its issuance if any threat of its market value fell below that parity. The mechanism that cured the hyperinflation was the simple adjustment of supply.

# Lessons learned from the German hyperinflation.

The first lesson is that even a politically independent central bank does not provide reliable protection against the destruction of (paper) money. The Reichsbank had been made politically independent as early as 1922 already. This was a request on behalf of the allied forces as a service rendered. In return, they temporarily agreed to deferred reparation payments. Still, the Reichsbank council decided to hyperinflate the currency.

The second lesson is that fiat paper money won’t work without being backed by some standard. Throughout history, the gold standard proved to be a great inflationary measure control. Paper money is political money, and as such, it is a disruptive element in a system of free markets that does more good than harm.

*""Ensuring the possibility for redeeming in gold at any one time must be the endeavor of all issuers of paper money."" -* HJALMAR SCHACHT

Paper money, injected into the economy through bank credit, brings about a situation of over-indebtedness. The policy of choice to cure the remedy of over-indebtedness? Printing even more money. Undoubtedly, it is a vicious cycle.

The present-day United States has been using credit-produced paper monies for decades. Because of this, we can draw many interesting similarities between the United States and the Weimar republic. But first, we will examine why the 2008 financial crisis stimulus-response never caused any significant inflation.

# The inflation that never happened

Many analysts erroneously compare what is happening now in the United States with what happened in 2008. In reality, the two situations could not have been more different.

When central banks print money at a fever pitch, it does not necessarily mean that money ends up in the hands of people and businesses. 2008 is a classic example of this. The modus operandi of the FED is to issue money by purchasing Treasuries and Mortgage-backed loans from the banks. In turn, this money goes to the bank’s reserves that they can then lend out.

So what happened in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis? Instead of lending the money out, the banks hoarded the cash themselves in a desperate attempt at self-preservation. It is important to keep in mind the economic climate at the time. The 2008 financial crisis was spurred on by banks not having sufficient cash reserves, causing them to default. After Lehman Brothers went bust, banks started hoarding as many reserves as possible.

The consequence? Most of the money printed by the FED never ended up in the hands of the people. As a result, inflation never increased. The below graph illustrates the amount of paper money held as reserves by banks in the U.S. Notice the increase after 2008.

&#x200B;

# Why inflation in the U.S will rise

The reason is the same as all other inflation periods in history: too much money supply causing the currency to degenerate in value. A picture is worth a thousand words, and the below graph showing the money supply in the U.S economy shows it all.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hjpy98c3xp071.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=5061a190ad0c8388206b38a64e7e9dc7f9a7b8be

In 2020 alone, the Federal Reserve printed more than 20% of all dollars ever printed. Illustrated by the graph above, one can see why there is an increasing concern in this regard. The 2020 money supply dwarfs out even the 2008 financial crisis response. In context, 2008 was a previous money printing record and has already raised concerns back then. In 2020 the Federal Reserve printed more money than the last four years combined.

# Why the Covid-19 stimulus will cause the inflation

We already touched on the fact that most of the money printed by the FED in 2008 ended up being hoarded by the banks. As a result, very little of the 2008 response made it into the hands of people and businesses. The Covid-19 relief stimulus package is very different in two respects. The first is that banks can not hoard any more money. They have reached full capacity regarding what reserves they can store before running into liquidity crises themselves. This is alarming because the banks hoarding money in 2008 was the only thing standing between the FED and a rapid rise in inflation. The second reason is unlike in 2008, billions of dollars are injected into the real economy into the hands of businesses and people. This is the typical pattern that has caused inflation throughout history. In fact, there is no difference.

# Banks complain they have too much money now.

The modus operandi of the FED is not much different in terms of raising money than it was in 2008. They followed the same recipe. If it worked for them in 2008, why would it not work now? The problem is that banks have too much money now. It does not seem like something that would be a problem for most people. Why would anyone complain about having too much money, you might ask. We will cover that in detail. First, have a look at the scrapbook of newspaper articles touching on the same subject.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/be3qwedbxp071.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb5cbb9ae23b2bccbe9d13f70ef2bdd90981357

To understand why too much money is a bad thing for banks, we first have to explain the basic business model of banks. Banks make their money by accepting deposits and then lending out their reserves at an interest rate. In return, they also pay an interest rate to the depositor, albeit a lower rate.

With the FED printing and raising money to the extent they have, banks already sit with too many reserves. Adding to that, you have all the extra deposits coming in from people receiving stimulus packages. At the same time, there is less appetite for people taking out loans due to the uncertainty regarding Covid-19. Banks now sit with deposits they have to pay interest on. At the same time, they are not making money from it by lending it out. Whereas in 2008, the banks were propping up the reserves, they are now desperate to lend out money.

Of course, there are other dimensions to this problem, like minimum regulatory capital requirements for each $1 deposited. Having too many reserves can also lead to banks running into liquidity issues.

In short, banks can not take on any more money. If there is any more rapid financing resulting from the FED printing more money, it will push banks into having liquidity issues. Unlike 2008, banks are desperate to lend out money. Add this money supply originating from the bank lending to the $2 trillion already released into the economy due to the stimulus, and you have the perfect inflation storm.

# The similarities between the Covid-19 stimulus package and past inflations

All inflation cycles in the past followed the same pattern. First, a rapid increase in money supply followed by the splendor of economic growth and prosperity. That, in turn, is later followed by inflation, leading to the death of currencies.

We already covered the fact that the saving grace in 2008 was that banks absorbed most of the money raised. Very little of the money printed by the FED made it into the hands of people. The Covid-19 stimulus is very different in this regard. This time around, the U.S. stimulus package allocates more than $2 trillion to different groups in society, injecting money into the real economy. The breakdown is as follows:

* $560 billion to individuals
* $500 billion to large corporations
* $377 billion to small businesses
* $340 billion to state and local governments
* $154 billion for public health
* $44 billion for education and other causes

Not only that, together with the stimulus by the previous Trump administration, the total stimulus amounts to more than 27 percent of the U.S GDP. That’s nearly four times the share implemented in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

The only other country with a more aggressive stimulus response to the Covid-19 pandemic is Japan. We all know Japan is not really the poster child to follow when it comes to inflation. Japan has been struggling with deflation for more than two decades.

# Why we conclude inflation will rise in the U.S

There is nothing new in terms of inflation, from the days of our earliest ancestors to the present day. The magic of money causes the death of money. Every time in history where governments have resulted in printing more unbacked paper money to stimulate economies, inflation followed.

The one exception was 2008. The reason for that is that banks absorbed most of the money. As a result, most of the stimulus the money did not make it into the real economy. The Covid-19 stimulus package is different in this regard. First of all, the banks don’t have the capacity to absorb more money without running into liquidity issues themselves. The second and most important difference with 2008 is the injection of $2 trillion into different parts of the economy. This is the same classic example we have seen throughout history. Not much more needs to be said about that other than throughout history, where more money was injected into the economy at this scale, inflation always followed without fail.

8412,2021-05-22,wallstreetbets,"TLDR; use log scale on your charts before posting about bubbles

Use a logarithmic scale and you will see the market is growing at the rate it has been growing most of the time. Or at least the currency it's getting debased, whatever. So no, the charts don't show a bubble. Now if there is some hidden stuff like CDOs in 2008 happening somewhere else, we are going to find out when it happens, before that, no one knows shit.

edit: the market suffered a prolonged drawdown in 1920s to 1940s, but you see the market recovered fast after 1920s massacre, I put my money down that the recovery stalled in the 40s because someone (I think called hitler) was killing jews for sport in europe and the japanese captured the American colony of Philippines and some shit. So yeah, unless there is a WWIII I don't suspect there will be another 20-30 year long drawdown. In which case, I don't give a shit about stocks.

Edit 2: my fellow apes, just to be very very clear. I don't claim there won't be a crash. All I'm saying is, non logged charts are not an indicator of it. There might be there might not be. I don't know! But there are other arguments to be made not poor charting!

* **Current support at 60 SMMA**
* **Current resistance at 20 SMMA**

When asked the detail they reply by some evasive way. Let's look at the a very widely mentioned TA indicator know as Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA). Note that depending on the trading platform it might have different name. Here is a 1-day chart with moving average indicators for 20-day and 60-day below. The frequency of the data points are set at 1 minute.

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(1-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators ](https://preview.redd.it/9pgrbjn05q071.jpg?width=1915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f791febda72367d086560c590f33d3b80556d5b2)

The blue line is indicating 20-day SMMA and the orange line is 60-day. I drew some lines to show short term trend by pink and cyan colors. If you look at the price action around the pink straight lines you see that SPY is below both lines that means none of the 60-day or 20-day SMMA is acting as support here. Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen. Or it might happens a lot and that's why these TA guys never post their gains along with time of buy and sell orders.

Now they might say, well 1-min will not work do it for 15 minutes or even 5 minutes. Let's see exactly the same SPY daily chart with 5-minutes frequency below-

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(5-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators](https://preview.redd.it/pd26lwg97q071.jpg?width=1918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e299624911f1199dbee4b691009c364d321ed77b)

Exactly the same chart with only difference is number of data points, which is smaller due to 5 minutes time interval. Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.   

Now look at the same chart with 15-minutes time interval below-

Tell me what is support or resistance here? At what price point would you buy calls or puts and where would you exit?

They might say you need to look at the RSI, MACD, BBW, CMO, CCI, KB, EMA, CADO, DSS, spotgamma, venna, chart etc. you know that they have no idea what they are talking. 

Discard these all indicators, if you just play around with the daily, 2-day, 5-day, weekly, 10-day, monthly timeframe with 1-min, 5-min, 10-min, 30-min frequency, you end up with over 20 different looking charts where if you plot just a single indicator it will be different in all those chart.

Here you can see we **broke out of a large descending wedge on Friday** (with fantastic volume). This is the same pattern damn near every speculative growth stock has been caught in for the past few months. Normally it has a bearish bias - because it is coming from downside. However, in this scenario - **it broke up -** which means **we can see some fantastic follow through to the upside.**

The price targets for this setup would be **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71.** These are all resistances - and in a normal situation you would either trim as we run into these, or scale in as we clear them.

However - given the news catalyst - it's hard to say how high we will gap up on Monday. Above that last level is **34.84** and **36.63.** It's unlikely we cross these without an insane short squeeze, or another pattern forming (at least on the shorter term charts).

Remember, each time we clear one of these levels on a **daily close -** it will become a support. As a result, you can trail your stop loss below them as we continue.

This is one of many examples of **""technicals precede news""** I have encountered throughout my trading career - and one of the reasons I try to ignore anything except for the charts while I am trading. It's hard to quantify arbitrary events - and especially hard to do so without bias. Thankfully, we will often **break out of a major pattern prior to a news release -** like you see here.

8423,2021-05-22,wallstreetbets,"  

While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals® (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

· IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration – Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) – Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) – Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it. 

The chicken shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:    [Chlorinated chicken explained: why do the Americans treat their poultry with chlorine? | Analysis & Features | The Grocer](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/food-safety/chlorinated-chicken-explained-why-do-the-americans-treat-their-poultry-with-chlorine/555618.article) – The US Poultry Industry chlorinates chicken as a part of the disinfection process.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

Alibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 6 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I took notice when these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that environmentally sustainable (basically they just monitor their carbon footprint), something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yen (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, roughly 10% off it's 52 week low.

Now what REALLY turned my head was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO. For Munger, one of THE most risk-adverse investors in history, to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

Since Munger's position was revealed, Reddit users took notice and has become the most talked about undervalued stock on Reddit.

I'd like to address this chart and comment:

""Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.""

[ To express what I see I'll provide my chart:](https://preview.redd.it/0ghkrgvhkr071.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99e69494648928d9891cb025a1da6b33f94835f)

Let's go back to the 20th first.

* 20 SMMA acted as support and was tested three times throughout the day on the 20th.
* The 20 SMMA would have played as a great indicator to BTFD for Friday.

Now lets focus on friday:

* Still have the 20 smma as support in the morning
* broke through 418 with blow-off top but failed to establish support.
* Tested 20 SMMA support at around 8 AM and failed but found support at top of gap (pretty common).
* Tested 20 SMMA as support at 9 AM but failed
* 20 SMMA now acted as resistance from about 9:15 - 11:30 (two fucking hours) Scalpers delight! Easily a 1x-3x bagger on an O'Hare.
* As you can see we bounced off the 120 SMMA and found support.
* The essentially consolidated for the rest of the day. ""*Consolidation* is the term for a *stock* or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. *Consolidated stocks* typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few *trading* opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

https://preview.redd.it/7y89c2awqr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=83d8c18d5dcf4bd08b12a1ac9e0cb00c0ee9d107

Taking this comment into account: ""Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen.""

Let's look at the RSI at the blow off top.  If you started buying O'Hare calls here then you belong in this sub.

https://preview.redd.it/s2vvxf86vr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=eca2606d4187b2ff947c6d1cfbd713101b2d9d01

TLDR - use basic ta for support and resistance. Use more than one indicator to confirm trends. Read my posts as conditional statements. If you have questions - ask - BUT don't be a dick. I provide bullish and bearish pts because like everyone else I don't know where the market is going to go in the future. SMMAs are a great tool but not good used by themselves. Use them to determine strength of trends IMO. Use them for shorting and buying opportunities off of bounces and rejections.

8432,2021-05-23,wallstreetbets,"So I may or may not have been smoking weed when this idea came to me, but I was sober when I bought 4K in options for these space etfs.  I had the revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector.  Increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I sobered up.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report.  However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  Many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  So does this sound logical or am I a retarded ape?",niz6qn,[],0

8434,2021-05-23,wallstreetbets,"One piece of news about United Wholesale Mortgage that has mostly gone under the radar is that UWMC will be included in the **MSCI World Small-Cap Index** starting on May 27. This has potential to be a significant catalyst next week, and I will lay out the reasons why here.

The list of new additions/deletions to this index can be found in the link to “MSCI Small Cap Indexes List of Additions/Deletions” on [this page](https://www.msci.com/index-review). UWMC appears on page 12 of this document as **“UWM HLDGS A”**. 

There is understandably some skepticism involved in regards to UWM and indexes after the fiasco with the Russell 1000 inclusion back in March. The blame for that mistake rests fully with FTSE Russell, as individual companies have no say on their inclusion or exclusion from the published lists. FTSE mistakenly added UWMC to the Q1 *preliminary* IPO addition list, and then later did not include it in the final list after realizing that by their own rules they do not include SPACs and a SPAC merger does not count as an IPO. But some key differences exist here with the MSCI Index.

First, the list published by MSCI is already the *final* list. It’s a done deal that UWMC will be in the MSCI index, it simply has to go into effect officially at the close of market on May 27. The other key difference, and **one which could potentially make this MSCI index inclusion a** ***meaningfully*** **greater catalyst** than UWMC’s June inclusion in the Russell 1000 index (for real this time), is the fact that UWMC is being listed in the *small-cap index*.

Why is it beneficial for UWMC to go in the *small-cap* index? It has to do with relative weighting within the index. Companies are ranked and weighted based on their relative market cap sizes within the index. The higher ranked companies get a higher weighting and thus make up a relatively larger percentage of the index. For example, the top holding in the MSCI World Small Cap Index is CZR which has a weight of 0.23% of the index. This means that any funds that track this index would have to purchase enough shares of CZR such that the stock makes up 0.23% of the total assets of the fund.

So how is this bullish for UWMC? Because when UWMC is added to the index, it will likely be one of the **top ten in ranking** (or just outside the top ten) based on its current market cap. [This page](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) from BlackRock’s iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF shows the top ten ranked holdings. TPR is the 9th company in this list (top is cash) as of May 20, 2021, with a relative weighting of 0.16%. As of the close of market Friday, TPR has a market cap of just under $12 Billion. In comparison, UWMC closed Friday with a higher market cap of $12.95 Billion. So this means that upon official inclusion, UWMC should be ranked right around the 10th place position, which should **give it a weighting of approximately 0.16%**.

This allows us to then calculate the approximate number of shares of UWMC that funds tracking the MSCI World Small-Cap Index will need to purchase when it is officially added. I found three main ETFs that track this index. There are likely other funds, but these three are sufficient I believe to make the case for why this is a meaningful catalyst.

>[BlackRock iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) \- Net Assets $4.12 Billion

>0.16% \* $4.12 Billion = $6.59 Million, corresponding to 816,800 shares @ $8.07.

>  
>0.16% \* $950 Million = $1.52 Million, corresponding to 188,350 shares @ $8.07.

In comparison, when UWMC is added to the Russell 1000, it will be ranked right around 550th place based on its current market cap, giving it a weighting of 0.03%. It’s inclusion in the Russell will still be a positive thing, given that there are many more funds that track the Russell than the MSCI index. But because of the 5.3x higher weighting that UWMC will have in the MSCI index, this gives its inclusion some significant OOMPH (legitimate financial term). [Studies have shown](https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion) that when a stock moves from the Russell 1000 down to the Russell 2000 due to a reduction in its market cap, the share price tends to move *up* shortly thereafter, because now it is one of the top companies in its respective index (with a higher respective weighting) rather than one of the smallest.

TL;DR: it is better to be a BIG fish in a ^(small) (cap) index than to be a small fish in a large index. Thus, I believe we can anticipate good things ahead with UWMC’s inclusion in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index.",nj0cj6,[],1

Because we see charts the way The Banks do.

2. Fed admits inflation may not be transitory

From fed : A number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and, if so, these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year.

3. Music stops for Silver nd Gold alternatives :

China opens its borders for gold imports. ( supportive for silver action )

Here is the Chinese offical goverment stance for Gold and silver from the following article so obvious . This is the first time saw that kind of bullish news . especially important that this news from Chinese official goverment declaration

[https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1224071.shtml](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1224071.shtml)

Social media platform some users call for switch to Gold which they said was more stable.

""I still expect a good gold price performance,"" he said, noting that investing in gold is convenient, while there is no formal way to invest in other assets .

Music stopped ! for gold and silver alternatives .

Still too complicated for many .

5.USD index ( DXY) breaking ;

One of the drivers for the next strong move up in silver will be the USD index (DXY) breaking below the Feb '18 low of 88.15 and descending into its 3yr cycle low. It is currently on calendar day 84 of the current intermediate cycle. They usual run 160-280 calendar days.

&#x200B;

 CPI inflation index is a poor historical tracker of the gold price. The pink dashed line below shows the cycle high price of $35/oz price from 1934 projected forward using CPI scaling. Clearly, M2 scaling with a mine-supply discount tracks the gold price much better.

Once this is all behind us, there should be a strong move up in gold into the summer. After that, I would expect the next big move in gold to be a push up to \~$3000 by mid-2022 .

7. Gold /silver Ratio :

&#x200B;

So silver will lead the metals and the gold/silver ratio, now at 67, will initially reach 30 like. The long term target is likely to be a lot lower, probably 15 or below. As talked before the expected Gold prices 3.000 usd in the mid of 2022 and with gold /silver ratio we can expect price range 150 -200 Usd /ozz which is x8 gain from actual 27.6 usd /ozz price .

&#x200B;

 

Now our tickets :

1. Physical Silver bars coins , or other stuff just as an example : The premiums are sky high so it is over . Spot at $28.15. Some internet sites  selling eagles for $44.28. Either something big is coming and they know it or someone selling this to you is wearing a ski mask. Either way, not sure why you would buy this product at this price.
2. PSLV Reaches $4 BILLION in Assets! 144,213,789 total ounces of Physical Silver  
53 million ounces of physical silver added in 2021 . Actually now only feasible alternative . Fully liquid and buy and sell in a second and also hedge yourself .
3. ZSİL ( swiss ) , or other European allocated ETFS .

My position : I have 1.700 ozz of physical silver

GME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \[Redacted\] as a payment option.

Newcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \[redacted\], a new \[redacted\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.

**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker’s Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it’s slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.

**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford’s CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

It's rather shocking to me that most people have never heard of Anktiva in the biotech Market space. Basically, a sleeper drug from IBRX. Remember when Keytruda was a sleeper drug for Merck? Keytruda probably the most valuable drug in all of biotech now. Seems like Anktiva will be a new cancer drug for a wide range of cancers. Not just one type but mutliple types of cancers. With minimal side-effects, Anktiva will be approved after a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in a phase 3 study by the FDA. But apparently, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. It's gonna be synonymous with cancer drug names like Keytruda. Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda). Crazy man.

8811,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"**Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy every MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/aa8ly369ml071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=67b2c365b81e385f25387cee225ea73634f84126

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)",nhyj2a,[],0

Edit: nice close at 19$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When fully operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. It will take time before they even sell half of that each year, so this is very good.



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Quebec will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Quebecker one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only local but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

8818,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"While SNDL’s market cap is only about a fifth of TLRY, it has more cash than Tilray on its balance sheet. In its earnings release, SNDL said that as of May 7, it had $752 million of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet.


Now, there are two narratives if you are interested in buying SNDL stock. First is the bullish one that points to the ample cash on its balance sheet. SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.

# Industry Overview and Outlook

* Low-interest rates have fueled consumer demand for refinancing existing debt and access to new debt
* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs
   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending
* Strong economy coupled with strong employment numbers have led to a surge in home sales
   * Pandemic-drriven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006
   * 5.6% increase YoY for homes sold

   * Approx. 79.3% growth since loan origination value of $41.4B from 2017
* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

8999,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"**Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy every MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

https://preview.redd.it/z8gvmc77ml071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=7584983651d13d7a8304098dffcd011109fc12e3

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/aa8ly369ml071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=67b2c365b81e385f25387cee225ea73634f84126

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do.

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When fully operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. It will take time before they even sell half of that each year, so this is very good.



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Quebec will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Quebecker one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only local but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

Now, there are two narratives if you are interested in buying SNDL stock. First is the bullish one that points to the ample cash on its balance sheet. SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.



To sum it up, from a purely business perspective, you will bet on TLRY. However, if you are looking at betting on an investment vehicle that can capitalize on the troubles of some of the smaller marijuana companies, SNDL will fit the bill.",nhzt5b,[],0

# Industry Overview and Outlook

* Low-interest rates have fueled consumer demand for refinancing existing debt and access to new debt
* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs
   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending
* Strong economy coupled with strong employment numbers have led to a surge in home sales
   * Pandemic-drriven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006
   * 5.6% increase YoY for homes sold

   * Approx. 79.3% growth since loan origination value of $41.4B from 2017
* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

Even though their cards are the strongest ray tracing cards in the market, their stock price hasn't moved since they released.

In the short term, there is a worldwide silicon shortage. NVidia needs to at least fulfill enough demand to meet earnings expectations. Since AMD, which is outperformed in ray tracing, killed earnings this quarter, NVidia will too.

In the long term, it will be open season for huge revenues from RTX 3000 sales as long as a superior line of GPUs doesn't release before the silicon shortage is dealt with.

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

9038,2021-05-22,wallstreetbets,"Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about *why* the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, *you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses.* Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit. Pricing sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. A lot of people who have the brainpower to price a stock don't have the conviction/temperament to stick by their call in the face of market swings. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

In any event, I have no actual point to this post, I just thought it was a really good insight. Go read his book!",niahr7,[],0
9047,2021-05-22,wallstreetbets,"Hello,

I have been buying GME since May 2020. I currently have a 200k bet that GME goes up. I want the squeeze as much as anyone.

However, I feel like it is my duty to explain what is going on. The $10,000,000 share price is not going to happen. Whales want you to think it is possible so they can sell at $500 and there will be enough depth in the market to exit.

How can we know this for sure? The NYSE literally cannot quote stock prices that high. Furthermore, the SEC and politicians literally think it is their job to reduce market volatility. When Gme went to $300 the White House got involved, there is no way they will let it go to $10,000 - much less $10,000,000.

Think about it: would any president allow the economy to crash over a video game company? Right as midterms are heating up? No, the government will halt trading for days, or weeks, until a deal is brokered with GME directors. Ryan C may not want to issue more stock, but it will be the only way to avoid jail time for “stock manipulation”. If you don’t think the gov will send innocent ppl to jail, then you have not been paying attention.

The point of this post is not to make anyone sad or angry, it is to offer good trading advice. I see people breaking up with their loved ones, underperforming at work, or alienating others over this saga. Don’t do this. life is long and you do not want to trash what you have built bc you think one share of GME is a winning lotto ticket. 

Everyone has their own exit strategy. Don’t let anyone talk you out of making money. if you think this is FUD, then you really have fallen for the whales and you will be left holding our bags.

I wish the best to everyone here. Good luck: Buy, Hold, Vote and plan an exit strategy!

But heres the thing. Inflation doesnt just fall from the skies. The value of a currency declines because the currency amount in float, in assets and overall rises + the velocity of this money escalates in parallel (so that 1 currency unit is spend multiple times more often).

When these things happen, we get Inflation and maybe some time later rising interest rates (which usually dont even keep up with the devaluing of currency!). BUT additionally, asset and goods prices grow even more.

It is an ancient concept almost as old as man himself. There has been nothing really new about inflation in the thousands of years of inflation’s history, and there still is not. Governments have been repeating the same mistake throughout history, sometimes leading to vicious cycles of hyperinflation. They have perpetually been rediscovering first the splendors and later the woes of inflation. Foolishly, each new government discovering this ” magic of money” seems to believe that no one has ever beheld such splendors before. The end result is always the same – the death of money.

Admittedly this is a long post, but we have to follow the thread of inflation throughout history to understand what is happening in the United States today. That is exactly what we will do. We will also look at one particular case where inflation never happened, the 2008 financial crisis.

# In the beginning, was inflation

Money probably made its first appearance soon after the earliest caveman had his first successful hunt. Not long after he started hunting, he probably realized he could use animal skin as counters for trading spearheads and other goods with other cave dwellers. Anything like those animal skins with an accepted symbolic value, greater than its intrinsic value, was true money.

Because of human nature’s inherent yearning for more power and status, it probably did not take long for the smarter amongst the cavemen leaders to realize that controlling money was key to increasing his fortune. If he could decree what money was, then he could issue the money and gain political power. Not only that, but he could also benefit materially by exchanging money for things like spearheads and caves. We can speculate endlessly about what form the first money manifested in. It does not really matter. What is important is that the money manifested in a form that only the caveman leader could control. Probably something in the form of a specific animal’s skin that only he was allowed to hunt.

Along with a rising requirement for more caves and spearheads, the leader probably responded by hunting this exclusive animal more. As he hunted more, more animal skins became available, and the animal skins started losing their value as a means of trading. Undoubtedly, it did not take long for the price of spearheads and caves to rise in terms of animal skins. Buckled under the pressure of an oversupply of animal skin that was losing value, the subordinate cavemen experienced the first-ever inflation.

Not only was this the first example of inflation, but it was also the first example of government finance.

# Inflation through the ages

Man has evolved and progressed in many ways since the days we first left our caves. We landed on the moon and created the Higgs Boson collider. Yet, in contrast, there has been little progress in the area of inflation. In terms of inflation, there is nothing new under the sun. From the caveman beginnings to today, governments have perpetually rediscovered first the splendors and later inflation woes. This tragedy of the magic of money causing the death of money keeps on repeating itself in different forms. What follows here is a thread of inflation through history into the present day.

# The death of the Nummus (300 A.D)

&#x200B;

[Nummus Coins](https://preview.redd.it/0koiv421wp071.jpg?width=246&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b9a4fe807e5cb8dd78f714f1897f66b8dd555be)

One of the most violent and earliest forms of inflation occurred around the year 300 A.D. Not only was it a violent affair in terms of killing money. It also caused the death of hundreds of Romans in the form of the death penalty.

Nummi was a Roman empire era government-issued coin. It was made of copper washed with silver. The material to manufacture this coin was abundant across the Roman empire and, as a result, cheap to manufacture. As a natural consequence, the Roman empire, under Emperor Diocletian, produced more and more coins.

As more and more Nummi coins were produced, the Nummi started losing value. The price of goods and services began to rise. In response to this, the Emperor introduced strict price control measures in the form of price ceilings. Violators of the stipulated price ceilings would receive the death penalty. After inflicting many death penalties, the situation still did not improve. There were just too many Nummi in circulation, rendering it worthless. At some point, ordinary Romans preferred trading in items ranging from clay pottery to stones and ornaments instead of the Nummi. It is not the first time in history we will see basic elements like clay carrying more value than money. During the 1920s hyperinflation in Germany, it was cheaper to use paper money for making fires instead of purchasing firewood.

The result? The death of the Nummi. Throughout history, we will see the same pattern emerge where the “magic” of inflation leads to the death of money.

# Inflation through the centuries

So it has gone throughout man’s recorded history. Man has known inflation for centuries. Babylon and Ancient China both recorded inflations. The kings of England and France were inflationists, especially King Henry. The 1700s was characterized by worldwide inflation. The American Revolution and French revolution were the precursors of the paper printing mania of the 20th century. Throughout history, rising prices have been the rule and not the exception.

# The 1920 Germany hyperinflation

One of the well-known examples of hyperinflation is that of Weimar Germany in the 1920s. In the early 1920s, Germany was in a period of hyperinflation. In the end, the mark was worth only one trillionth of its original value. By November of 1923, the currency would depreciate to 4,200,000,000,000 marks to one US dollar.

Below are examples of 20,000,000, 50,000,000, 1,000,000,000, and 5,000,000,000 mark bills. At the time of hyperinflation, ordinary Germans would use notes like these to purchase basic goods like bread.

# The German inflation had its roots in World War I

Leading up to World War I, Germany decided to drop the gold standard. The gold-backed Reichsmark (or “Goldmark,” as it was referred to from 1914) became the unbacked Papermark. Initially, the Reich financed its war outlays in large part by issuing debt. Total public debt rose from 5.2bn Papermark in 1914 to 105.3bn in 1918. Germany hoped that it would quickly win the war and reap the bounty from the nations it conquered. Like all other governments before them, the Germans first discovered the splendors and later the woes of inflation.

During the war, the government used propaganda to hide the dire situation of the economy from the German public. Regardless of their propaganda attempts, the Germans could feel its detrimental effect in their daily lives. As a consequence, many soldiers deserted the war to head back home to support their families. In November 1918, things reached a boiling point. From all walks of life, Germans across the political spectrum united and took control of Germany’s cities. Furious at their material conditions, they demanded an end to the war. Kaiser Wilhelm II’s monarchy was toppled, and the war ended.

# The treaty of Versailles

The new Weimar Republic faced tremendous economic and political challenges. Already under pressure from internal crises, the treaty of Versailles just added more fuel to the fire.  According to the treaty, repatriations were to be repaid to the victorious allies. These repatriations were equivalent to half a trillion contemporary US dollars. The new and fledgling democratic government wanted to cater as best as possible to the wishes of their voters. For this reason, the government opted not to increase taxes too aggressively. As a result of this, tax revenues were insufficient to finance these outlays. Consequently, the Reichsbank (Germany’s central bank) started running the printing press.

# The result of the German hyperinflation

From April 1920 to March 1921, the ratio of tax revenues to debt amounted to just 37 percent. As the Reichsbank printed more currency to make up the difference, the rates worsened, and hyperinflation quickly reared its head. At its height, hyperinflation in Weimar Germany reached rates of more than 30,000% per month. To put this into context, one has to compare the price of eggs over time. In 1918, you could have bought 500 billion eggs for the same money you would have to spend five years later for just one egg. Essentially the money was worthless. Prices of goods and services doubled every few days. In fact, the money was worth less than firewood. Below are some historic photos from the time.

# How did the German hyperinflation end?

Hyperinflation has become untenable. Farmers refused to take any form of paper money for their crops. The harvest of 1923 sat in farmers’ warehouses while supermarkets in the cities were empty. As a result, starvation and civil unrest loomed.

On Oct. 15, 1923, the Rentenmark Ordinance was published. This paved the way for a new currency to be issued by a new institution, the Rentenbank. This new currency would be equivalent in value to the gold-linked prewar mark, or Rentenmark. At last, the printing of the now-defunct Papermarks ceased on November 15th. On Nov. 20. The devalued Papermark was pegged to the Rentenmark at a trillion to one. As a consequence, the hyperinflation ended, and Germany was back on a gold standard system.

Interestingly, the Rentenbank apparently held no gold bullion. Instead, the bank held mostly debt in mortgages on property and bonds on the German industry. Moreover, the Rentenmark was also not redeemable in gold. The main thing with the Rentenmark was that its value remained equivalent to gold. This was accomplished by reducing its issuance if any threat of its market value fell below that parity. The mechanism that cured the hyperinflation was the simple adjustment of supply.

# Lessons learned from the German hyperinflation.

The first lesson is that even a politically independent central bank does not provide reliable protection against the destruction of (paper) money. The Reichsbank had been made politically independent as early as 1922 already. This was a request on behalf of the allied forces as a service rendered. In return, they temporarily agreed to deferred reparation payments. Still, the Reichsbank council decided to hyperinflate the currency.

The second lesson is that fiat paper money won’t work without being backed by some standard. Throughout history, the gold standard proved to be a great inflationary measure control. Paper money is political money, and as such, it is a disruptive element in a system of free markets that does more good than harm.

*""Ensuring the possibility for redeeming in gold at any one time must be the endeavor of all issuers of paper money."" -* HJALMAR SCHACHT

Paper money, injected into the economy through bank credit, brings about a situation of over-indebtedness. The policy of choice to cure the remedy of over-indebtedness? Printing even more money. Undoubtedly, it is a vicious cycle.

The present-day United States has been using credit-produced paper monies for decades. Because of this, we can draw many interesting similarities between the United States and the Weimar republic. But first, we will examine why the 2008 financial crisis stimulus-response never caused any significant inflation.

# The inflation that never happened

Many analysts erroneously compare what is happening now in the United States with what happened in 2008. In reality, the two situations could not have been more different.

When central banks print money at a fever pitch, it does not necessarily mean that money ends up in the hands of people and businesses. 2008 is a classic example of this. The modus operandi of the FED is to issue money by purchasing Treasuries and Mortgage-backed loans from the banks. In turn, this money goes to the bank’s reserves that they can then lend out.

So what happened in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis? Instead of lending the money out, the banks hoarded the cash themselves in a desperate attempt at self-preservation. It is important to keep in mind the economic climate at the time. The 2008 financial crisis was spurred on by banks not having sufficient cash reserves, causing them to default. After Lehman Brothers went bust, banks started hoarding as many reserves as possible.

The consequence? Most of the money printed by the FED never ended up in the hands of the people. As a result, inflation never increased. The below graph illustrates the amount of paper money held as reserves by banks in the U.S. Notice the increase after 2008.

&#x200B;

# Why inflation in the U.S will rise

The reason is the same as all other inflation periods in history: too much money supply causing the currency to degenerate in value. A picture is worth a thousand words, and the below graph showing the money supply in the U.S economy shows it all.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hjpy98c3xp071.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=5061a190ad0c8388206b38a64e7e9dc7f9a7b8be

In 2020 alone, the Federal Reserve printed more than 20% of all dollars ever printed. Illustrated by the graph above, one can see why there is an increasing concern in this regard. The 2020 money supply dwarfs out even the 2008 financial crisis response. In context, 2008 was a previous money printing record and has already raised concerns back then. In 2020 the Federal Reserve printed more money than the last four years combined.

# Why the Covid-19 stimulus will cause the inflation

We already touched on the fact that most of the money printed by the FED in 2008 ended up being hoarded by the banks. As a result, very little of the 2008 response made it into the hands of people and businesses. The Covid-19 relief stimulus package is very different in two respects. The first is that banks can not hoard any more money. They have reached full capacity regarding what reserves they can store before running into liquidity crises themselves. This is alarming because the banks hoarding money in 2008 was the only thing standing between the FED and a rapid rise in inflation. The second reason is unlike in 2008, billions of dollars are injected into the real economy into the hands of businesses and people. This is the typical pattern that has caused inflation throughout history. In fact, there is no difference.

# Banks complain they have too much money now.

The modus operandi of the FED is not much different in terms of raising money than it was in 2008. They followed the same recipe. If it worked for them in 2008, why would it not work now? The problem is that banks have too much money now. It does not seem like something that would be a problem for most people. Why would anyone complain about having too much money, you might ask. We will cover that in detail. First, have a look at the scrapbook of newspaper articles touching on the same subject.

To understand why too much money is a bad thing for banks, we first have to explain the basic business model of banks. Banks make their money by accepting deposits and then lending out their reserves at an interest rate. In return, they also pay an interest rate to the depositor, albeit a lower rate.

With the FED printing and raising money to the extent they have, banks already sit with too many reserves. Adding to that, you have all the extra deposits coming in from people receiving stimulus packages. At the same time, there is less appetite for people taking out loans due to the uncertainty regarding Covid-19. Banks now sit with deposits they have to pay interest on. At the same time, they are not making money from it by lending it out. Whereas in 2008, the banks were propping up the reserves, they are now desperate to lend out money.

Of course, there are other dimensions to this problem, like minimum regulatory capital requirements for each $1 deposited. Having too many reserves can also lead to banks running into liquidity issues.

In short, banks can not take on any more money. If there is any more rapid financing resulting from the FED printing more money, it will push banks into having liquidity issues. Unlike 2008, banks are desperate to lend out money. Add this money supply originating from the bank lending to the $2 trillion already released into the economy due to the stimulus, and you have the perfect inflation storm.

# The similarities between the Covid-19 stimulus package and past inflations

All inflation cycles in the past followed the same pattern. First, a rapid increase in money supply followed by the splendor of economic growth and prosperity. That, in turn, is later followed by inflation, leading to the death of currencies.

We already covered the fact that the saving grace in 2008 was that banks absorbed most of the money raised. Very little of the money printed by the FED made it into the hands of people. The Covid-19 stimulus is very different in this regard. This time around, the U.S. stimulus package allocates more than $2 trillion to different groups in society, injecting money into the real economy. The breakdown is as follows:

* $560 billion to individuals
* $500 billion to large corporations
* $377 billion to small businesses
* $340 billion to state and local governments
* $154 billion for public health
* $44 billion for education and other causes

Not only that, together with the stimulus by the previous Trump administration, the total stimulus amounts to more than 27 percent of the U.S GDP. That’s nearly four times the share implemented in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

The only other country with a more aggressive stimulus response to the Covid-19 pandemic is Japan. We all know Japan is not really the poster child to follow when it comes to inflation. Japan has been struggling with deflation for more than two decades.

# Why we conclude inflation will rise in the U.S

There is nothing new in terms of inflation, from the days of our earliest ancestors to the present day. The magic of money causes the death of money. Every time in history where governments have resulted in printing more unbacked paper money to stimulate economies, inflation followed.

The one exception was 2008. The reason for that is that banks absorbed most of the money. As a result, most of the stimulus the money did not make it into the real economy. The Covid-19 stimulus package is different in this regard. First of all, the banks don’t have the capacity to absorb more money without running into liquidity issues themselves. The second and most important difference with 2008 is the injection of $2 trillion into different parts of the economy. This is the same classic example we have seen throughout history. Not much more needs to be said about that other than throughout history, where more money was injected into the economy at this scale, inflation always followed without fail.

* **Current support at 60 SMMA**
* **Current resistance at 20 SMMA**

When asked the detail they reply by some evasive way. Let's look at the a very widely mentioned TA indicator know as Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA). Note that depending on the trading platform it might have different name. Here is a 1-day chart with moving average indicators for 20-day and 60-day below. The frequency of the data points are set at 1 minute.

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(1-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators ](https://preview.redd.it/9pgrbjn05q071.jpg?width=1915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f791febda72367d086560c590f33d3b80556d5b2)

The blue line is indicating 20-day SMMA and the orange line is 60-day. I drew some lines to show short term trend by pink and cyan colors. If you look at the price action around the pink straight lines you see that SPY is below both lines that means none of the 60-day or 20-day SMMA is acting as support here. Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen. Or it might happens a lot and that's why these TA guys never post their gains along with time of buy and sell orders.

Now they might say, well 1-min will not work do it for 15 minutes or even 5 minutes. Let's see exactly the same SPY daily chart with 5-minutes frequency below-

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(5-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators](https://preview.redd.it/pd26lwg97q071.jpg?width=1918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e299624911f1199dbee4b691009c364d321ed77b)

Exactly the same chart with only difference is number of data points, which is smaller due to 5 minutes time interval. Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.   

Now look at the same chart with 15-minutes time interval below-

Tell me what is support or resistance here? At what price point would you buy calls or puts and where would you exit?

They might say you need to look at the RSI, MACD, BBW, CMO, CCI, KB, EMA, CADO, DSS, spotgamma, venna, chart etc. you know that they have no idea what they are talking. 

Discard these all indicators, if you just play around with the daily, 2-day, 5-day, weekly, 10-day, monthly timeframe with 1-min, 5-min, 10-min, 30-min frequency, you end up with over 20 different looking charts where if you plot just a single indicator it will be different in all those chart.

However - given the news catalyst - it's hard to say how high we will gap up on Monday. Above that last level is **34.84** and **36.63.** It's unlikely we cross these without an insane short squeeze, or another pattern forming (at least on the shorter term charts).

Remember, each time we clear one of these levels on a **daily close -** it will become a support. As a result, you can trail your stop loss below them as we continue.

While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals® (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

· IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration – Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) – Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) – Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

[https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness)

Alibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 6 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I took notice when these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that environmentally sustainable (basically they just monitor their carbon footprint), something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yen (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, roughly 10% off it's 52 week low.

Now what REALLY turned my head was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO. For Munger, one of THE most risk-adverse investors in history, to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

Since Munger's position was revealed, Reddit users took notice and has become the most talked about undervalued stock on Reddit.

In short, there are times when investing seems easy. As Buffett says ""We simply attempt to be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.""",niwxaz,[],1
9081,2021-05-23,wallstreetbets,"This asshat started tolling on my post (my perspective): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i\_spy\_521\_recap\_and\_524\_outlook/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i_spy_521_recap_and_524_outlook/)

And then called me out in a post - without calling me out. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical\_analysis\_on\_smoothed\_moving\_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical_analysis_on_smoothed_moving_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3)

So id just like to give my perspective on what I'm seeing on the charts. Its all in the eye of the beholder so take it as a grain of salt. This TA has helped me make money and, I believe, gives me an edge. But to each his own. If you are making money with your own method then congratulations. Not gonna poo all over you if it doesn't align with my method and strategies.

From the [5/21 read post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhrou0/i_spy_521_read/)

A few things in TA my notes:

* called support and resistance levels.
* Called small moves
* Called that bulls need to break 418 and test 418 as support. As you can see we failed bulls.
* But bears did not break 414.
* Also called out a 20 SMMA test. Which we tested and failed.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/vhi7x1l5or071.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b7f89491be4eb7f6ab15b0c4e8149d803ada9f0)

From the spot gamma notes:

* look at abs gamma strike and look what was said.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/j6xkdqb9pr071.png?width=1398&format=png&auto=webp&s=df15d5b87b146ca6cdf391dbc9fada46db89a1b2)

I'd like to address this chart and comment:

""Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.""

[ To express what I see I'll provide my chart:](https://preview.redd.it/0ghkrgvhkr071.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99e69494648928d9891cb025a1da6b33f94835f)

Let's go back to the 20th first.

* 20 SMMA acted as support and was tested three times throughout the day on the 20th.
* The 20 SMMA would have played as a great indicator to BTFD for Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/1dnhk0s0lr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0dc044b41db5df168ee01cf164486e120281a5

Now lets focus on friday:

* Still have the 20 smma as support in the morning
* broke through 418 with blow-off top but failed to establish support.
* Tested 20 SMMA support at around 8 AM and failed but found support at top of gap (pretty common).
* Tested 20 SMMA as support at 9 AM but failed
* 20 SMMA now acted as resistance from about 9:15 - 11:30 (two fucking hours) Scalpers delight! Easily a 1x-3x bagger on an O'Hare.
* As you can see we bounced off the 120 SMMA and found support.
* The essentially consolidated for the rest of the day. ""*Consolidation* is the term for a *stock* or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. *Consolidated stocks* typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few *trading* opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

https://preview.redd.it/7y89c2awqr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=83d8c18d5dcf4bd08b12a1ac9e0cb00c0ee9d107

Taking this comment into account: ""Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen.""

Let's look at the RSI at the blow off top.  If you started buying O'Hare calls here then you belong in this sub.

https://preview.redd.it/s2vvxf86vr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=eca2606d4187b2ff947c6d1cfbd713101b2d9d01

TLDR - use basic ta for support and resistance. Use more than one indicator to confirm trends. Read my posts as conditional statements. If you have questions - ask - BUT don't be a dick. I provide bullish and bearish pts because like everyone else I don't know where the market is going to go in the future. SMMAs are a great tool but not good used by themselves. Use them to determine strength of trends IMO. Use them for shorting and buying opportunities off of bounces and rejections.

[Or just trade like this guy does with his ""ears to the ground"" and ""eyes open""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-qa7N-GJ-c)

9082,2021-05-23,wallstreetbets,"So I may or may not have been smoking weed when this idea came to me, but I was sober when I bought 4K in options for these space etfs.  I had the revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector.  Increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I sobered up.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report.  However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  Many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  So does this sound logical or am I a retarded ape?",niz6qn,[],0

9084,2021-05-23,wallstreetbets,"One piece of news about United Wholesale Mortgage that has mostly gone under the radar is that UWMC will be included in the **MSCI World Small-Cap Index** starting on May 27. This has potential to be a significant catalyst next week, and I will lay out the reasons why here.

The list of new additions/deletions to this index can be found in the link to “MSCI Small Cap Indexes List of Additions/Deletions” on [this page](https://www.msci.com/index-review). UWMC appears on page 12 of this document as **“UWM HLDGS A”**. 

There is understandably some skepticism involved in regards to UWM and indexes after the fiasco with the Russell 1000 inclusion back in March. The blame for that mistake rests fully with FTSE Russell, as individual companies have no say on their inclusion or exclusion from the published lists. FTSE mistakenly added UWMC to the Q1 *preliminary* IPO addition list, and then later did not include it in the final list after realizing that by their own rules they do not include SPACs and a SPAC merger does not count as an IPO. But some key differences exist here with the MSCI Index.

First, the list published by MSCI is already the *final* list. It’s a done deal that UWMC will be in the MSCI index, it simply has to go into effect officially at the close of market on May 27. The other key difference, and **one which could potentially make this MSCI index inclusion a** ***meaningfully*** **greater catalyst** than UWMC’s June inclusion in the Russell 1000 index (for real this time), is the fact that UWMC is being listed in the *small-cap index*.

Why is it beneficial for UWMC to go in the *small-cap* index? It has to do with relative weighting within the index. Companies are ranked and weighted based on their relative market cap sizes within the index. The higher ranked companies get a higher weighting and thus make up a relatively larger percentage of the index. For example, the top holding in the MSCI World Small Cap Index is CZR which has a weight of 0.23% of the index. This means that any funds that track this index would have to purchase enough shares of CZR such that the stock makes up 0.23% of the total assets of the fund.

So how is this bullish for UWMC? Because when UWMC is added to the index, it will likely be one of the **top ten in ranking** (or just outside the top ten) based on its current market cap. [This page](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) from BlackRock’s iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF shows the top ten ranked holdings. TPR is the 9th company in this list (top is cash) as of May 20, 2021, with a relative weighting of 0.16%. As of the close of market Friday, TPR has a market cap of just under $12 Billion. In comparison, UWMC closed Friday with a higher market cap of $12.95 Billion. So this means that upon official inclusion, UWMC should be ranked right around the 10th place position, which should **give it a weighting of approximately 0.16%**.

This allows us to then calculate the approximate number of shares of UWMC that funds tracking the MSCI World Small-Cap Index will need to purchase when it is officially added. I found three main ETFs that track this index. There are likely other funds, but these three are sufficient I believe to make the case for why this is a meaningful catalyst.

>[BlackRock iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) \- Net Assets $4.12 Billion  
>  
>0.16% \* $4.12 Billion = $6.59 Million, corresponding to 816,800 shares @ $8.07.  
>  
>[Vanguard Global Small-Cap Index Fund](https://markets.ft.com/data/funds/tearsheet/summary?s=IE00B42LF923:USD) \- Net Assets $3.69 Billion

>0.16% \* $3.69 Billion = $5.9 Million, corresponding to 731,600 shares @ $8.07.

>  
>0.16% \* $950 Million = $1.52 Million, corresponding to 188,350 shares @ $8.07.

In comparison, when UWMC is added to the Russell 1000, it will be ranked right around 550th place based on its current market cap, giving it a weighting of 0.03%. It’s inclusion in the Russell will still be a positive thing, given that there are many more funds that track the Russell than the MSCI index. But because of the 5.3x higher weighting that UWMC will have in the MSCI index, this gives its inclusion some significant OOMPH (legitimate financial term). [Studies have shown](https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion) that when a stock moves from the Russell 1000 down to the Russell 2000 due to a reduction in its market cap, the share price tends to move *up* shortly thereafter, because now it is one of the top companies in its respective index (with a higher respective weighting) rather than one of the smallest.

TL;DR: it is better to be a BIG fish in a ^(small) (cap) index than to be a small fish in a large index. Thus, I believe we can anticipate good things ahead with UWMC’s inclusion in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index.",nj0cj6,[],1

Because we see charts the way The Banks do.

2. Fed admits inflation may not be transitory

From fed : A number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and, if so, these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year.

Justput oil prices so you can expect CPI where :

3. Music stops for Silver nd Gold alternatives :

China opens its borders for gold imports. ( supportive for silver action )

Here is the Chinese offical goverment stance for Gold and silver from the following article so obvious . This is the first time saw that kind of bullish news . especially important that this news from Chinese official goverment declaration

[https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1224071.shtml](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1224071.shtml)

Social media platform some users call for switch to Gold which they said was more stable.

""I still expect a good gold price performance,"" he said, noting that investing in gold is convenient, while there is no formal way to invest in other assets .

Music stopped ! for gold and silver alternatives .

Still too complicated for many .

 

4. Big adds from SLV and PSLV this month the first after February almost 15 million ozz per month this is 2 % increase in total ETFS . Somebodies almost see the light

5.USD index ( DXY) breaking ;

One of the drivers for the next strong move up in silver will be the USD index (DXY) breaking below the Feb '18 low of 88.15 and descending into its 3yr cycle low. It is currently on calendar day 84 of the current intermediate cycle. They usual run 160-280 calendar days.

&#x200B;

 CPI inflation index is a poor historical tracker of the gold price. The pink dashed line below shows the cycle high price of $35/oz price from 1934 projected forward using CPI scaling. Clearly, M2 scaling with a mine-supply discount tracks the gold price much better. 

&#x200B;

Once this is all behind us, there should be a strong move up in gold into the summer. After that, I would expect the next big move in gold to be a push up to \~$3000 by mid-2022 .

7. Gold /silver Ratio :

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qx731gzxsu071.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3cb9f153d10fc7005f61f4baf19f14ca104c9f4

 

So silver will lead the metals and the gold/silver ratio, now at 67, will initially reach 30 like. The long term target is likely to be a lot lower, probably 15 or below. As talked before the expected Gold prices 3.000 usd in the mid of 2022 and with gold /silver ratio we can expect price range 150 -200 Usd /ozz which is x8 gain from actual 27.6 usd /ozz price .

&#x200B;

 

Now our tickets :

1. Physical Silver bars coins , or other stuff just as an example : The premiums are sky high so it is over . Spot at $28.15. Some internet sites  selling eagles for $44.28. Either something big is coming and they know it or someone selling this to you is wearing a ski mask. Either way, not sure why you would buy this product at this price.
2. PSLV Reaches $4 BILLION in Assets! 144,213,789 total ounces of Physical Silver  
53 million ounces of physical silver added in 2021 . Actually now only feasible alternative . Fully liquid and buy and sell in a second and also hedge yourself .
3. ZSİL ( swiss ) , or other European allocated ETFS .

My position : I have 1.700 ozz of physical silver

Nothing here is financial advice ............................................

Loves you all although got many negative comments and I want all you see this opportunity . Even mosts are not in . At leaast 5 /10 % add to your portfolio and play your usual stock or option games .

9091,2021-05-23,wallstreetbets,"This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. You can find the last week's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nds2vh/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/rc961bm4hv071.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4701a99fd4471a560552f895ebcc817e72e334d3

GME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \[Redacted\] as a payment option.

Newcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \[redacted\], a new \[redacted\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.

**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker’s Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it’s slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.

**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford’s CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

9136,2021-05-23,wallstreetbets,"Hey retards, it's been awhile since I've posted an actual DD, but I'm back (had to repost this cause mods). Before I start, he's my [track record](https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:TheHappyItalianMan), you can obviously check my post history too. I wanted to added upon my post earlier today, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nimruw/im_gay_for_dick_kings_dkng/). My DD's generally end up in the right direct, but this current one will be my largest bet to date. So here we fucking go my fellow autists. You ready to learn about Dick Kings?  Whats the fucking play? It's DraftKings (DKNG). **$DKNG 100c 1/21/22**

[POSITIONS HERE I AM AUTISTIC](https://imgur.com/gallery/7ZK85CN)

In this post, I will breaking down ***what is DKNG***, providing an up to date ***SWOT*** (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) ***Analysis***, looking at a screenshot of their ***fundamentals*** and a deep dive into their current state of ***Technical Analysis*** *a*nd if you don't understand any of this yet, don't worry there's a tl;dr at the bottom for you really *\*SPECIAL\** investors.

[www.draftkings.com](https://preview.redd.it/gpkamsly2w071.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7aba9b539db4d87fb7239a78f7e55bc2fc65f17)

**DraftKings** is an American daily fantasy sports contest (dfs), sports betting operator (sportsbook), and virtual casino platform (igaming). Essentially it's a fucking money pit for retards who have gambling addictions, and according to a [Harvard Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230631/#:~:text=Based%20on%20its%20analysis%20of,activities%20in%20the%20past%20year) conducted in fucking 1997, approximately 1% of adults have gambling addictions, I'm sure with todays ease of access, it's more like 2%, so, \~6.6 million retards are at severe risk to giving DraftKings their bank accounts. Like I said, this shit is a money pit, they provide a service that results in LITERAL FREE MONEY. Instead of driving to a casino, these geniuses at DraftKings are allowing some individuals to gamble from the comfort of their couch, it's amazing. Also, when I say retards, take that lightly last Saturday, I gambled away, and streamed myself in an undisclosed off-brand WSB discord, $500 in an online casino, and gamble on sports, daily, hell, last NFL season I finished first in the r/sportsbook betting contest. [PROOF (i love gambling)](https://imgur.com/gallery/woD8Vpu). With that said, if you like something buy it, if you love something invest in it. I love gambling, and will invest in the BEST *legal* sports book out there, DKNG, aka Donkey Kong, aka Donkey Dick, aka Dick Kings. :kek:

**SWOT ANALYSIS of Dick Kings**

**STRENGTHS:**

* Industry leaders: currently DKNG is legal in more [states](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/help/sports-betting/where-is-sports-betting-legal?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2Fhelp%2Fsports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal&wpcn=help&wpscn=sports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal) than any other sportsbook platform, they're legal in 11, with 2 on the brink of legalization, and a window of opportunity by eoy for the remaining 11 states where it is legal.
* Marketing/Advertising: if you're a sports guy, you'll noticed DKNG is fucking everywhere, you cant escape it. They're all over social media and are on every fucking commercial.  They spent 77% OF THEIR [REVENUE ON MARKETING PLATFORMS LMAO](https://www.actionnetwork.com/legal-online-sports-betting/draftkings-reports-increased-revenue-marketing-2020-earnings).
* Partnerships: They currently have a partnership with the NFL, UFC, MLB, three [NBA teams](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/02/draftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F&wpcn=about&wpscn=news%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F), and they own a [Nascar](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2021/05/20/draftkings-joins-nascar-star-bubba-wallace-23xi-racing/). Not only that, but Disney (ESPN) has a 6% stake in their company, yeah the largest sports network in America owns a [6% stake of DKNG.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17950769) (dont fuck with the mouse). They also have upcoming partnerships with Dish Network, and I'm sure they have a fuck ton of other promotions on the way.
* Ease of access: you literally type it in the browser, or download an app. Deposit you wage cuck check through paypal or via debit card and within 1 hour your entire check could be gone, it's that easy.
* UI: You know how everyone says, ""oh don't use robinhood, it's bad, it's so cancer, they sell your data."" Shut the fuck up, you know that UI is fucking sexy and that's why you keep buying FDs that's the same shit with DKNG. I've used hundreds of online casinos and sportsbook, personally bovada is my go to, but for legal books, DraftKings is by far the best, no question. That platform is sexy, look how clean this is compared to fanduel.

[dark mode. NICE COCK](https://preview.redd.it/izc1z4433w071.jpg?width=994&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb103c557913ee7284b132ddabaa2254c62518fc)

[disgusting light mode??? wtf is this trash LMAO. srs?](https://preview.redd.it/o1b0ydg43w071.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d690151a2c8518715623b5e8770eaf2b99d1aa2)

**WEAKNESSES:**

* They care too much, and try to hard to make as much money as possible? wtf? you thought imma drop actual weaknesses, imma straight shill. No thanks LMAO. Fan Duel, Barstool sportsbook is straight trash. dafuq.

**OPPORTUNITIES:**

* State Legalizations, currently there are only 24 states where sportsbooks, igaming is legal, but it's expected to be legal nationwide in the next 1-3 years. Maryland, Nevada, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and New York are on the brink of having DKNG in their states. I know a few of those states legalize literally just last week.
* Partnerships, with the amount of money DraftKings is spending, they're going to have deals with the NHL, NBA and possibly even some college ball in the next few months. I wouldn't be surprised to see DKNG become the official sportsbook of the NFL in the future. I know a few [stadiums](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.giants.com/news/draftkings-and-new-york-giants-announce-official-exclusive-sports-betting-deal) offer DKNG sportsbook in stadium, and I think this will become the norm in the next few years. You'll be able to go to a ballpark, stadium and place your bet directly there right next to your $40 beer (cause inflation).
* Social Media. I think where it stands right now, if you google DraftKings, their social media platform is okay, but in the next few months, especially near NFL season, it'll absolutely explode. They obviously have a facebook, twitter accounts, instagram and they are extremely interactive, they have daily podcasts and shit, but that's all so new. Their accounts are all growing, and I know as their social media presence becomes established, their brand name will grow as well.
* Buyouts, again, as a I said above Disney has a 6% stake in DKNG, I wouldn't be surprised to see Disney too onto their ownership and possible even buyout Draft Kings, I mean, imagine that. Disney, ESPN and DraftKings, all under the same parent company. That would be insane. You don't see Barstool (Penn), or Fanduel with that kind of opportunity.
* Igaming, I think this platform is so slept on. Virtual casinos are the fucking future, let me tell you, I've been doing this shit for years and once you legal bros get into this shit, you'll be hooked. There's absolutely nothing better than sitting your fat ass on the couch and blowing through hundreds of dollars betting martingale on black 7 times in a row. SHIT IS FUCKING GREAT. If they can develop a strong Igaming presence, they'll be loaded. Igaming is \~$[250 billion industry](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/gaming-market-2020-2025-size-share-trends-growth-value-and-research-report-2021-03-03?tesla=y#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,Mobile)

**THREATS:**

* Their only threat is competition, which is actually a strength because their competition is dog water. Barstool Sports can't get a partnership with the largest revenue sport, the NFL, because the NFL commish Roger Goodell absolutely hates the face of Barstool, aka Portnoy. I love Portnoy, but guy is a week away from some fucked up-cocaine induced canceling, I'm telling you. Barstool will entertain the stoolies, but they'll never become the Mcdonalds of fastfood, they'll always be the fucking nasty ass trash Burger King that you have to go to because the Mcdonalds line is too long. Fanduel is owned by a UK company, what do they know about American sports. WHAT COMPETITION.

Their revenue has absolutely gone bananas in Q1, which is fucking insane, because there were some rumors that DKNG lost a fuck ton of money from the [superbowl](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nhbr.com/the-brady-effect-new-hampshire-lottery-sacked-in-super-bowl-betting/#:~:text=State%20takes%20a%20%243%20million,the%20Bucs%20and%20their%20QB&text=While%20New%20Englanders%20bet%20heavily,hole%20on%20Super%20Bowl%20Sunday). Anyway, as you can see their revenue grew a dick-ton. The big scary here is their net is horrible, why, the big no no? Sales and Marketing. I was worried about that too, but that's their game plan, to a spend a fuck ton of money to game market dominance early on, retention rate is key to this industry. Jason Robbins their CEO said it on a [podcast the other day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93aGVyZXRoZW1vbmV5aXMubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/Nzg3ZDM1Y2QtMTgxYS00ODBhLTllZGMtMzFmZDdlNWNlMTIx?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwisjdvGtt7wAhWKUt8KHVAoCCkQjrkEegQIBBAI&ep=6), they're in preseason, training camp in this market. They're still warming up to the full opportunity.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/draftkings-reports-first-quarter-2021-results-and-raises-2021](https://preview.redd.it/4w1istie3w071.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=6116ae4857dac73c83688feb1796471896cdaac8)

So to touch upon their spending again, as you can see their spending is working. They gained new degens at a rate of 114% compared to the first quarter of 2020. INSANE GROWTH. They're growing and retaining rates at a crazy level.

[more good. less bad.](https://preview.redd.it/ezqljieg3w071.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=690df56ebd62a93b9ec73feaad69223f02f07997)

tl;dr REVENUE PUMP. They're expected to blow revenue out of the water, shit is going full parabolic. Raising revenue guidance to $1.15 billion,

[25&#37; of the population](https://preview.redd.it/3qlsfe9i3w071.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=ada7e5758aa5e16c10bb0f90170e996b885bade9)

DKNG only has access to 25% of the U.S. population as of right now, and the stock is at what $45, what till this shit nation wide.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/static-files\/4d3d4ba2-b2e0-4081-bb6c-7c74f6cc2145](https://preview.redd.it/em8i3xik3w071.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2f7b6e7ce522ac05036a0084169e95c014b7bd9)

No dilution until $135 a share, and you aren't buying this absolute diamond right now? wtf.

&#x200B;

**Price Targets**

[https:\/\/www.tipranks.com\/stocks\/dkng\/forecast](https://preview.redd.it/r13pqcbp3w071.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=47959e0448a1ab6c6b30b2488d8814b7df3ccb69)

DKNG is sitting pretty right above their low price target at $42.00, and you aint buying? Look at these price targets, a ceiling of $105.

&#x200B;

**Institutional Ownership**

[Disney](https://preview.redd.it/fpk8uzlr3w071.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=377c457af3927b4d7ff5396d147235738138e07a)

Look at the dates of filing and values. A lot of the media is shitting on Cathie Woods for buying DKNG religiously, but nobody is shitting on BlackRock for owning over 8million shares. As a wise man once told man, BlackRock is the United States testicles, they are the balls of this country. If they buy something, you know that shit is going to cum to the moon. It's insane how many of these big names are buying right now.

**Technical Analysis** so I hate to be the guy, but this is the [only stock I've traded all year](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/).

SHORT TERM(1-3 months):

[wedge, no vol.](https://preview.redd.it/ueoiofxw3w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=0806df6ce5521a17081b3a632be2b02361c355e4)

As you can see from the chart above, we're currently trading in between the 7d sma and 50d sma on the 2hr. This is most likely complete confirmation bias, but I backed tested when DKNG has a daily closed inbetween this same crunch since it drooped the spac name, and whenever it has this same set up, these are the next day, and or two day returns.

02/10 +10.48% , 03/04 +13.89% , 03/25 +1.62% , 07/16 +9.46% , 09/09 +9.11% , 11/05 +9.05% , 1/08/21 +4.48% ,3/10/21 +11.48% , 04/26/21 +1.91%

Try it yourself. This is actually the reason why I bought weeklies eod friday. Check my positions at the top. I think in the next few weeks, DKNG will go to that top level resistance line at \~49.5, and then it could trade sideways for a bit longer to fill that volume gap from 44.5 to 49.5, but I do think a pump day is coming nonetheless.

&#x200B;

LONG TERM(3-12 months):

[Support \/ Meme Line](https://preview.redd.it/014ln9o04w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=845d45afafea0c86a25b60729e5039fb328d1c45)

So, longterm (3-12 month window), referring to the chart at the top, it looks like DKNG has found support off the 35.5 bottom it hit in September, there's massive volume support at the 42.5 line, and that looks to be the new floor (god forbid a market crash happens soon, plz no fomc june 18th taper tantrum). It looks like the next major test for DKNG is at the 200d SMA or 51.52. If you look at RSI, it's leaving oversold territory, and MACD is flashing a reversal. I think we're due for a next wave of highs on DKNG. I could see this popping to \~49.5-51.5 -> \~60 -> all time highs. TA is looking dumb bullish you fucking idiots. Buy this shit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**CONCLUSION**

in conclusion, I fucking love the stock. Technical and Fundamentals showing a strong buy. Dick Kings is about to cum, and be sure you're there to catch the cum, because once this thing is near it's edge, it's going to absolute nut. I know I wont want to miss suc.. am I gay? anyway. buy dkng.

TL;DR I might be gay now, but buy DKNG, Shit looks like an absolute steal. Later nerds **$DKNG 100c 1/21/22** [POSITIONS HERE I AM AUTISTIC](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://imgur.com/gallery/7ZK85CN)",njaa8g,[],0
9275,2021-05-21,wallstreetbets,"While SNDL’s market cap is only about a fifth of TLRY, it has more cash than Tilray on its balance sheet. In its earnings release, SNDL said that as of May 7, it had $752 million of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet.


Now, there are two narratives if you are interested in buying SNDL stock. First is the bullish one that points to the ample cash on its balance sheet. SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.



To sum it up, from a purely business perspective, you will bet on TLRY. However, if you are looking at betting on an investment vehicle that can capitalize on the troubles of some of the smaller marijuana companies, SNDL will fit the bill.",nhzt5b,[],0

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

Large open interest & volume on the June 18 expiration date, any reason why there's x10 times the normal open interest on the options expiring June 18? over 15M shares to cover options in the money as of today

GOLD is a good value company, with over 12B in revenue in 2020 & market cap is only 3.5x last year's revenue. Over 2B/yr in earnings the last 2 years & 5B in cash. Most of the business is in Gold mining 20% is in copper. Commodity prices keep climbing higher, so it's a good hedge for inflation.

For full disclosure I own several calls at the $20, $22, $23  expiring in June-Sept as well as shares of GOLD for the long to medium term. I'm no financial advisor and I'm likely wrong.

The stock has been seeing some resistance at $25 lately, but if the price of gold per ounce ($1881 currently) crosses the $1890... June is going to be a very good month for Barrick Gold. It's a quality company in my opinion & the market is at a tipping point, so it's a good safety net (maybe...)

Demand has been extreme, they sell out immediately when they're available and cost 3-4x retail in used markets. Even though their cards are the strongest ray tracing cards in the market, their stock price hasn't moved since they released.

In the short term, there is a worldwide silicon shortage. NVidia needs to at least fulfill enough demand to meet earnings expectations. Since AMD, which is outperformed in ray tracing, killed earnings this quarter, NVidia will too.

In the long term, it will be open season for huge revenues from RTX 3000 sales as long as a superior line of GPUs doesn't release before the silicon shortage is dealt with.

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

Stay safe & GLTA!

Edit: Additionally, in early February, Tilray announced it has established an agreement with **Grow Pharma** to import and distribute Tilray’s medical cannabis products into the [United Kingdom](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209005404/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Announces-Agreement-with-Grow-Pharma-to-Import-and-Distribute-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-the-United-Kingdom). This agreement allows Tilray to provide authorized UK patients in need with a locally maintained supply of medical cannabis solutions.

>This partnership with Grow Pharma provides patients in need access to a sustained supply of GMP-certified, high-quality medical cannabis and is an important step in improving access in the UK. Tilray will continue to advocate for reasonable patient access to medical cannabis in Europe and countries around the world

9307,2021-05-22,wallstreetbets,"Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about *why* the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, *you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses.* Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit. Pricing sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. A lot of people who have the brainpower to price a stock don't have the conviction/temperament to stick by their call in the face of market swings. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

In any event, I have no actual point to this post, I just thought it was a really good insight. Go read his book!",niahr7,[],0
9316,2021-05-22,wallstreetbets,"Hello,

I have been buying GME since May 2020. I currently have a 200k bet that GME goes up. I want the squeeze as much as anyone.

However, I feel like it is my duty to explain what is going on. The $10,000,000 share price is not going to happen. Whales want you to think it is possible so they can sell at $500 and there will be enough depth in the market to exit.

How can we know this for sure? The NYSE literally cannot quote stock prices that high. Furthermore, the SEC and politicians literally think it is their job to reduce market volatility. When Gme went to $300 the White House got involved, there is no way they will let it go to $10,000 - much less $10,000,000.

Think about it: would any president allow the economy to crash over a video game company? Right as midterms are heating up? No, the government will halt trading for days, or weeks, until a deal is brokered with GME directors. Ryan C may not want to issue more stock, but it will be the only way to avoid jail time for “stock manipulation”. If you don’t think the gov will send innocent ppl to jail, then you have not been paying attention.

The point of this post is not to make anyone sad or angry, it is to offer good trading advice. I see people breaking up with their loved ones, underperforming at work, or alienating others over this saga. Don’t do this. life is long and you do not want to trash what you have built bc you think one share of GME is a winning lotto ticket. 

Everyone has their own exit strategy. Don’t let anyone talk you out of making money. if you think this is FUD, then you really have fallen for the whales and you will be left holding our bags.

I wish the best to everyone here. Good luck: Buy, Hold, Vote and plan an exit strategy!

When these things happen, we get Inflation and maybe some time later rising interest rates (which usually dont even keep up with the devaluing of currency!). BUT additionally, asset and goods prices grow even more.

\- Release, release, release! VSS Unity has successfully separated from VMS Eve.

\- VSS Unity’s rocket motor has been ignited by our pilots CJ Sturckow and Dave Mackay.

\- Rocket motor shutdown. Momentum will keep VSS Unity travelling upwards towards apogee.

\- VSS Unity enters coast phase. Tail-booms raised into “feathered” re-entry position.

I think DraftKings is about to absolutely explode or die down to 30d SMA on the 2hr (~43.60) and then pop up. Either way this is looking extremely bullish.

I believe we’re going to break out of this current wedge and push to the 50d SMA on the weekly chart. There’s absolute no volume support above the current resistance point. We could essentially “gap” up to about ~49.5 and then trickle down to build consolidation and fill the volume support from 44.5-49.5. This a 100 stock in a year no question, but the short term pop is the play.

9331,2021-05-22,wallstreetbets,"We all have some basic idea of inflation—the rise in the price of goods over time. Inflation is a very, very old concept. It is an ancient concept almost as old as man himself. There has been nothing really new about inflation in the thousands of years of inflation’s history, and there still is not. Governments have been repeating the same mistake throughout history, sometimes leading to vicious cycles of hyperinflation. They have perpetually been rediscovering first the splendors and later the woes of inflation. Foolishly, each new government discovering this ” magic of money” seems to believe that no one has ever beheld such splendors before. The end result is always the same – the death of money.

Admittedly this is a long post, but we have to follow the thread of inflation throughout history to understand what is happening in the United States today. That is exactly what we will do. We will also look at one particular case where inflation never happened, the 2008 financial crisis. Later in the post, there is a comparison between what the Federal Reserve is doing today regarding the Covid-19 response stimulus package and the inflation trends throughout history. Finally, we will make our case why we believe that inflation is about to rise in the United States.

# In the beginning, was inflation

Money probably made its first appearance soon after the earliest caveman had his first successful hunt. Not long after he started hunting, he probably realized he could use animal skin as counters for trading spearheads and other goods with other cave dwellers. Anything like those animal skins with an accepted symbolic value, greater than its intrinsic value, was true money.

Because of human nature’s inherent yearning for more power and status, it probably did not take long for the smarter amongst the cavemen leaders to realize that controlling money was key to increasing his fortune. If he could decree what money was, then he could issue the money and gain political power. Not only that, but he could also benefit materially by exchanging money for things like spearheads and caves. We can speculate endlessly about what form the first money manifested in. It does not really matter. What is important is that the money manifested in a form that only the caveman leader could control. Probably something in the form of a specific animal’s skin that only he was allowed to hunt.

Along with a rising requirement for more caves and spearheads, the leader probably responded by hunting this exclusive animal more. As he hunted more, more animal skins became available, and the animal skins started losing their value as a means of trading. Undoubtedly, it did not take long for the price of spearheads and caves to rise in terms of animal skins. Buckled under the pressure of an oversupply of animal skin that was losing value, the subordinate cavemen experienced the first-ever inflation.

Not only was this the first example of inflation, but it was also the first example of government finance.

# Inflation through the ages

Man has evolved and progressed in many ways since the days we first left our caves. We landed on the moon and created the Higgs Boson collider. Yet, in contrast, there has been little progress in the area of inflation. In terms of inflation, there is nothing new under the sun. From the caveman beginnings to today, governments have perpetually rediscovered first the splendors and later inflation woes. This tragedy of the magic of money causing the death of money keeps on repeating itself in different forms. What follows here is a thread of inflation through history into the present day.

# The death of the Nummus (300 A.D)

&#x200B;

[Nummus Coins](https://preview.redd.it/0koiv421wp071.jpg?width=246&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b9a4fe807e5cb8dd78f714f1897f66b8dd555be)

One of the most violent and earliest forms of inflation occurred around the year 300 A.D. Not only was it a violent affair in terms of killing money. It also caused the death of hundreds of Romans in the form of the death penalty.

Nummi was a Roman empire era government-issued coin. It was made of copper washed with silver. The material to manufacture this coin was abundant across the Roman empire and, as a result, cheap to manufacture. As a natural consequence, the Roman empire, under Emperor Diocletian, produced more and more coins.

As more and more Nummi coins were produced, the Nummi started losing value. The price of goods and services began to rise. In response to this, the Emperor introduced strict price control measures in the form of price ceilings. Violators of the stipulated price ceilings would receive the death penalty. After inflicting many death penalties, the situation still did not improve. There were just too many Nummi in circulation, rendering it worthless. At some point, ordinary Romans preferred trading in items ranging from clay pottery to stones and ornaments instead of the Nummi. It is not the first time in history we will see basic elements like clay carrying more value than money. During the 1920s hyperinflation in Germany, it was cheaper to use paper money for making fires instead of purchasing firewood.

The result? The death of the Nummi. Throughout history, we will see the same pattern emerge where the “magic” of inflation leads to the death of money.

# Inflation through the centuries

So it has gone throughout man’s recorded history. Man has known inflation for centuries. Babylon and Ancient China both recorded inflations. The kings of England and France were inflationists, especially King Henry. The 1700s was characterized by worldwide inflation. The American Revolution and French revolution were the precursors of the paper printing mania of the 20th century. Throughout history, rising prices have been the rule and not the exception.

# The 1920 Germany hyperinflation

One of the well-known examples of hyperinflation is that of Weimar Germany in the 1920s. In the early 1920s, Germany was in a period of hyperinflation. In the end, the mark was worth only one trillionth of its original value. By November of 1923, the currency would depreciate to 4,200,000,000,000 marks to one US dollar.

Below are examples of 20,000,000, 50,000,000, 1,000,000,000, and 5,000,000,000 mark bills. At the time of hyperinflation, ordinary Germans would use notes like these to purchase basic goods like bread.

# The German inflation had its roots in World War I

Leading up to World War I, Germany decided to drop the gold standard. The gold-backed Reichsmark (or “Goldmark,” as it was referred to from 1914) became the unbacked Papermark. Initially, the Reich financed its war outlays in large part by issuing debt. Total public debt rose from 5.2bn Papermark in 1914 to 105.3bn in 1918. Germany hoped that it would quickly win the war and reap the bounty from the nations it conquered. Like all other governments before them, the Germans first discovered the splendors and later the woes of inflation.

During the war, the government used propaganda to hide the dire situation of the economy from the German public. Regardless of their propaganda attempts, the Germans could feel its detrimental effect in their daily lives. As a consequence, many soldiers deserted the war to head back home to support their families. In November 1918, things reached a boiling point. From all walks of life, Germans across the political spectrum united and took control of Germany’s cities. Furious at their material conditions, they demanded an end to the war. Kaiser Wilhelm II’s monarchy was toppled, and the war ended.

# The treaty of Versailles

The new Weimar Republic faced tremendous economic and political challenges. Already under pressure from internal crises, the treaty of Versailles just added more fuel to the fire.  According to the treaty, repatriations were to be repaid to the victorious allies. These repatriations were equivalent to half a trillion contemporary US dollars. The new and fledgling democratic government wanted to cater as best as possible to the wishes of their voters. For this reason, the government opted not to increase taxes too aggressively. As a result of this, tax revenues were insufficient to finance these outlays. Consequently, the Reichsbank (Germany’s central bank) started running the printing press.

# The result of the German hyperinflation

From April 1920 to March 1921, the ratio of tax revenues to debt amounted to just 37 percent. As the Reichsbank printed more currency to make up the difference, the rates worsened, and hyperinflation quickly reared its head. At its height, hyperinflation in Weimar Germany reached rates of more than 30,000% per month. To put this into context, one has to compare the price of eggs over time. In 1918, you could have bought 500 billion eggs for the same money you would have to spend five years later for just one egg. Essentially the money was worthless. Prices of goods and services doubled every few days. In fact, the money was worth less than firewood. Below are some historic photos from the time.

# How did the German hyperinflation end?

Hyperinflation has become untenable. Farmers refused to take any form of paper money for their crops. The harvest of 1923 sat in farmers’ warehouses while supermarkets in the cities were empty. As a result, starvation and civil unrest loomed.

On Oct. 15, 1923, the Rentenmark Ordinance was published. This paved the way for a new currency to be issued by a new institution, the Rentenbank. This new currency would be equivalent in value to the gold-linked prewar mark, or Rentenmark. At last, the printing of the now-defunct Papermarks ceased on November 15th. On Nov. 20. The devalued Papermark was pegged to the Rentenmark at a trillion to one. As a consequence, the hyperinflation ended, and Germany was back on a gold standard system.

Interestingly, the Rentenbank apparently held no gold bullion. Instead, the bank held mostly debt in mortgages on property and bonds on the German industry. Moreover, the Rentenmark was also not redeemable in gold. The main thing with the Rentenmark was that its value remained equivalent to gold. This was accomplished by reducing its issuance if any threat of its market value fell below that parity. The mechanism that cured the hyperinflation was the simple adjustment of supply.

# Lessons learned from the German hyperinflation.

The first lesson is that even a politically independent central bank does not provide reliable protection against the destruction of (paper) money. The Reichsbank had been made politically independent as early as 1922 already. This was a request on behalf of the allied forces as a service rendered. In return, they temporarily agreed to deferred reparation payments. Still, the Reichsbank council decided to hyperinflate the currency.

The second lesson is that fiat paper money won’t work without being backed by some standard. Throughout history, the gold standard proved to be a great inflationary measure control. Paper money is political money, and as such, it is a disruptive element in a system of free markets that does more good than harm.

*""Ensuring the possibility for redeeming in gold at any one time must be the endeavor of all issuers of paper money."" -* HJALMAR SCHACHT

Paper money, injected into the economy through bank credit, brings about a situation of over-indebtedness. The policy of choice to cure the remedy of over-indebtedness? Printing even more money. Undoubtedly, it is a vicious cycle.

The present-day United States has been using credit-produced paper monies for decades. Because of this, we can draw many interesting similarities between the United States and the Weimar republic. But first, we will examine why the 2008 financial crisis stimulus-response never caused any significant inflation.

# The inflation that never happened

Many analysts erroneously compare what is happening now in the United States with what happened in 2008. In reality, the two situations could not have been more different.

When central banks print money at a fever pitch, it does not necessarily mean that money ends up in the hands of people and businesses. 2008 is a classic example of this. The modus operandi of the FED is to issue money by purchasing Treasuries and Mortgage-backed loans from the banks. In turn, this money goes to the bank’s reserves that they can then lend out.

So what happened in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis? Instead of lending the money out, the banks hoarded the cash themselves in a desperate attempt at self-preservation. It is important to keep in mind the economic climate at the time. The 2008 financial crisis was spurred on by banks not having sufficient cash reserves, causing them to default. After Lehman Brothers went bust, banks started hoarding as many reserves as possible.

The consequence? Most of the money printed by the FED never ended up in the hands of the people. As a result, inflation never increased. The below graph illustrates the amount of paper money held as reserves by banks in the U.S. Notice the increase after 2008.

&#x200B;

# Why inflation in the U.S will rise

The reason is the same as all other inflation periods in history: too much money supply causing the currency to degenerate in value. A picture is worth a thousand words, and the below graph showing the money supply in the U.S economy shows it all.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hjpy98c3xp071.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=5061a190ad0c8388206b38a64e7e9dc7f9a7b8be

In 2020 alone, the Federal Reserve printed more than 20% of all dollars ever printed. Illustrated by the graph above, one can see why there is an increasing concern in this regard. The 2020 money supply dwarfs out even the 2008 financial crisis response. In context, 2008 was a previous money printing record and has already raised concerns back then. In 2020 the Federal Reserve printed more money than the last four years combined.

# Why the Covid-19 stimulus will cause the inflation

We already touched on the fact that most of the money printed by the FED in 2008 ended up being hoarded by the banks. As a result, very little of the 2008 response made it into the hands of people and businesses. The Covid-19 relief stimulus package is very different in two respects. The first is that banks can not hoard any more money. They have reached full capacity regarding what reserves they can store before running into liquidity crises themselves. This is alarming because the banks hoarding money in 2008 was the only thing standing between the FED and a rapid rise in inflation. The second reason is unlike in 2008, billions of dollars are injected into the real economy into the hands of businesses and people. This is the typical pattern that has caused inflation throughout history. In fact, there is no difference.

# Banks complain they have too much money now.

The modus operandi of the FED is not much different in terms of raising money than it was in 2008. They followed the same recipe. If it worked for them in 2008, why would it not work now? The problem is that banks have too much money now. It does not seem like something that would be a problem for most people. Why would anyone complain about having too much money, you might ask. We will cover that in detail. First, have a look at the scrapbook of newspaper articles touching on the same subject.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/be3qwedbxp071.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb5cbb9ae23b2bccbe9d13f70ef2bdd90981357

To understand why too much money is a bad thing for banks, we first have to explain the basic business model of banks. Banks make their money by accepting deposits and then lending out their reserves at an interest rate. In return, they also pay an interest rate to the depositor, albeit a lower rate.

With the FED printing and raising money to the extent they have, banks already sit with too many reserves. Adding to that, you have all the extra deposits coming in from people receiving stimulus packages. At the same time, there is less appetite for people taking out loans due to the uncertainty regarding Covid-19. Banks now sit with deposits they have to pay interest on. At the same time, they are not making money from it by lending it out. Whereas in 2008, the banks were propping up the reserves, they are now desperate to lend out money.

Of course, there are other dimensions to this problem, like minimum regulatory capital requirements for each $1 deposited. Having too many reserves can also lead to banks running into liquidity issues.

In short, banks can not take on any more money. If there is any more rapid financing resulting from the FED printing more money, it will push banks into having liquidity issues. Unlike 2008, banks are desperate to lend out money. Add this money supply originating from the bank lending to the $2 trillion already released into the economy due to the stimulus, and you have the perfect inflation storm.

# The similarities between the Covid-19 stimulus package and past inflations

All inflation cycles in the past followed the same pattern. First, a rapid increase in money supply followed by the splendor of economic growth and prosperity. That, in turn, is later followed by inflation, leading to the death of currencies.

We already covered the fact that the saving grace in 2008 was that banks absorbed most of the money raised. Very little of the money printed by the FED made it into the hands of people. The Covid-19 stimulus is very different in this regard. This time around, the U.S. stimulus package allocates more than $2 trillion to different groups in society, injecting money into the real economy. The breakdown is as follows:

* $560 billion to individuals
* $500 billion to large corporations
* $377 billion to small businesses
* $340 billion to state and local governments
* $154 billion for public health
* $44 billion for education and other causes

Not only that, together with the stimulus by the previous Trump administration, the total stimulus amounts to more than 27 percent of the U.S GDP. That’s nearly four times the share implemented in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

The only other country with a more aggressive stimulus response to the Covid-19 pandemic is Japan. We all know Japan is not really the poster child to follow when it comes to inflation. Japan has been struggling with deflation for more than two decades.

# Why we conclude inflation will rise in the U.S

There is nothing new in terms of inflation, from the days of our earliest ancestors to the present day. The magic of money causes the death of money. Every time in history where governments have resulted in printing more unbacked paper money to stimulate economies, inflation followed.

The one exception was 2008. The reason for that is that banks absorbed most of the money. As a result, most of the stimulus the money did not make it into the real economy. The Covid-19 stimulus package is different in this regard. First of all, the banks don’t have the capacity to absorb more money without running into liquidity issues themselves. The second and most important difference with 2008 is the injection of $2 trillion into different parts of the economy. This is the same classic example we have seen throughout history. Not much more needs to be said about that other than throughout history, where more money was injected into the economy at this scale, inflation always followed without fail.

Note that depending on the trading platform it might have different name. Here is a 1-day chart with moving average indicators for 20-day and 60-day below.

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(5-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators](https://preview.redd.it/pd26lwg97q071.jpg?width=1918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e299624911f1199dbee4b691009c364d321ed77b)

Exactly the same chart with only difference is number of data points, which is smaller due to 5 minutes time interval. Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.   

Now look at the same chart with 15-minutes time interval below-

Tell me what is support or resistance here? At what price point would you buy calls or puts and where would you exit?

They might say you need to look at the RSI, MACD, BBW, CMO, CCI, KB, EMA, CADO, DSS, spotgamma, venna, chart etc. you know that they have no idea what they are talking. 

Discard these all indicators, if you just play around with the daily, 2-day, 5-day, weekly, 10-day, monthly timeframe with 1-min, 5-min, 10-min, 30-min frequency, you end up with over 20 different looking charts where if you plot just a single indicator it will be different in all those chart.

Here you can see we **broke out of a large descending wedge on Friday** (with fantastic volume). This is the same pattern damn near every speculative growth stock has been caught in for the past few months. Normally it has a bearish bias - because it is coming from downside. However, in this scenario - **it broke up -** which means **we can see some fantastic follow through to the upside.**

The price targets for this setup would be **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71.** These are all resistances - and in a normal situation you would either trim as we run into these, or scale in as we clear them.

However - given the news catalyst - it's hard to say how high we will gap up on Monday. Above that last level is **34.84** and **36.63.** It's unlikely we cross these without an insane short squeeze, or another pattern forming (at least on the shorter term charts).

Remember, each time we clear one of these levels on a **daily close -** it will become a support. As a result, you can trail your stop loss below them as we continue.

This is one of many examples of **""technicals precede news""** I have encountered throughout my trading career - and one of the reasons I try to ignore anything except for the charts while I am trading. It's hard to quantify arbitrary events - and especially hard to do so without bias. Thankfully, we will often **break out of a major pattern prior to a news release -** like you see here.

While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals® (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

· IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration – Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) – Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) – Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it. 

The chicken shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:    [Chlorinated chicken explained: why do the Americans treat their poultry with chlorine? | Analysis & Features | The Grocer](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/food-safety/chlorinated-chicken-explained-why-do-the-americans-treat-their-poultry-with-chlorine/555618.article) – The US Poultry Industry chlorinates chicken as a part of the disinfection process. 

This dependency on chlor alkali to fight COVID isn’t just happening in America. Below are links to numerous countries around the globe using chlorine and chlorine based products heavily to fight COVID.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

First off, if you've been living under a rock and don't know what Alibaba is, here's a video about what the company does from CNN Business. [https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness)

Alibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 6 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I took notice when these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that environmentally sustainable (basically they just monitor their carbon footprint), something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yen (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, roughly 10% off it's 52 week low.

Now what REALLY turned my head was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO. For Munger, one of THE most risk-adverse investors in history, to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

Since Munger's position was revealed, Reddit users took notice and has become the most talked about undervalued stock on Reddit.

This TA has helped me make money and, I believe, gives me an edge. But to each his own. If you are making money with your own method then congratulations. Not gonna poo all over you if it doesn't align with my method and strategies.

From the [5/21 read post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhrou0/i_spy_521_read/)

A few things in TA my notes:

* called support and resistance levels.
* Called small moves
* Called that bulls need to break 418 and test 418 as support. As you can see we failed bulls.
* But bears did not break 414.
* Also called out a 20 SMMA test. Which we tested and failed.

I'd like to address this chart and comment:

""Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.""

[ To express what I see I'll provide my chart:](https://preview.redd.it/0ghkrgvhkr071.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99e69494648928d9891cb025a1da6b33f94835f)

Let's go back to the 20th first.

* 20 SMMA acted as support and was tested three times throughout the day on the 20th.
* The 20 SMMA would have played as a great indicator to BTFD for Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/1dnhk0s0lr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0dc044b41db5df168ee01cf164486e120281a5

Now lets focus on friday:

* Still have the 20 smma as support in the morning
* broke through 418 with blow-off top but failed to establish support.
* Tested 20 SMMA support at around 8 AM and failed but found support at top of gap (pretty common).
* Tested 20 SMMA as support at 9 AM but failed
* 20 SMMA now acted as resistance from about 9:15 - 11:30 (two fucking hours) Scalpers delight! Easily a 1x-3x bagger on an O'Hare.
* As you can see we bounced off the 120 SMMA and found support.
* The essentially consolidated for the rest of the day. ""*Consolidation* is the term for a *stock* or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. *Consolidated stocks* typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few *trading* opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

Taking this comment into account: ""Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen.""

Let's look at the RSI at the blow off top.  If you started buying O'Hare calls here then you belong in this sub.

TLDR - use basic ta for support and resistance. Use more than one indicator to confirm trends. Read my posts as conditional statements. If you have questions - ask - BUT don't be a dick. I provide bullish and bearish pts because like everyone else I don't know where the market is going to go in the future. SMMAs are a great tool but not good used by themselves. Use them to determine strength of trends IMO. Use them for shorting and buying opportunities off of bounces and rejections.

And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I sobered up.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report.  However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  Many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  So does this sound logical or am I a retarded ape?",niz6qn,[],0

The bull market is in the early innings and miners will offer leverage to the increasing gold price. Silver and silver miners will provide an even stronger inflation bet. The metals are just getting started. Gold and Silver miners are set to explode!!!!

9353,2021-05-23,wallstreetbets,"One piece of news about United Wholesale Mortgage that has mostly gone under the radar is that UWMC will be included in the **MSCI World Small-Cap Index** starting on May 27. This has potential to be a significant catalyst next week, and I will lay out the reasons why here.

The list of new additions/deletions to this index can be found in the link to “MSCI Small Cap Indexes List of Additions/Deletions” on [this page](https://www.msci.com/index-review). UWMC appears on page 12 of this document as **“UWM HLDGS A”**. 

There is understandably some skepticism involved in regards to UWM and indexes after the fiasco with the Russell 1000 inclusion back in March. The blame for that mistake rests fully with FTSE Russell, as individual companies have no say on their inclusion or exclusion from the published lists. FTSE mistakenly added UWMC to the Q1 *preliminary* IPO addition list, and then later did not include it in the final list after realizing that by their own rules they do not include SPACs and a SPAC merger does not count as an IPO. But some key differences exist here with the MSCI Index.

First, the list published by MSCI is already the *final* list. It’s a done deal that UWMC will be in the MSCI index, it simply has to go into effect officially at the close of market on May 27. The other key difference, and **one which could potentially make this MSCI index inclusion a** ***meaningfully*** **greater catalyst** than UWMC’s June inclusion in the Russell 1000 index (for real this time), is the fact that UWMC is being listed in the *small-cap index*.

Why is it beneficial for UWMC to go in the *small-cap* index? It has to do with relative weighting within the index. Companies are ranked and weighted based on their relative market cap sizes within the index. The higher ranked companies get a higher weighting and thus make up a relatively larger percentage of the index. For example, the top holding in the MSCI World Small Cap Index is CZR which has a weight of 0.23% of the index. This means that any funds that track this index would have to purchase enough shares of CZR such that the stock makes up 0.23% of the total assets of the fund.

So how is this bullish for UWMC? Because when UWMC is added to the index, it will likely be one of the **top ten in ranking** (or just outside the top ten) based on its current market cap. [This page](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) from BlackRock’s iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF shows the top ten ranked holdings. TPR is the 9th company in this list (top is cash) as of May 20, 2021, with a relative weighting of 0.16%. As of the close of market Friday, TPR has a market cap of just under $12 Billion. In comparison, UWMC closed Friday with a higher market cap of $12.95 Billion. So this means that upon official inclusion, UWMC should be ranked right around the 10th place position, which should **give it a weighting of approximately 0.16%**.

This allows us to then calculate the approximate number of shares of UWMC that funds tracking the MSCI World Small-Cap Index will need to purchase when it is officially added. I found three main ETFs that track this index. There are likely other funds, but these three are sufficient I believe to make the case for why this is a meaningful catalyst.

>[BlackRock iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) \- Net Assets $4.12 Billion  
>  
>0.16% \* $4.12 Billion = $6.59 Million, corresponding to 816,800 shares @ $8.07.  
>  
>[Vanguard Global Small-Cap Index Fund](https://markets.ft.com/data/funds/tearsheet/summary?s=IE00B42LF923:USD) \- Net Assets $3.69 Billion  
>  
>0.16% \* $3.69 Billion = $5.9 Million, corresponding to 731,600 shares @ $8.07.  
>  
>[SPDR MSCI World Small Cap ETF](https://www.ssga.com/uk/en_gb/institutional/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-zprs-gy) \- Net Assets $950 Million  
>  
>0.16% \* $950 Million = $1.52 Million, corresponding to 188,350 shares @ $8.07.

In comparison, when UWMC is added to the Russell 1000, it will be ranked right around 550th place based on its current market cap, giving it a weighting of 0.03%. It’s inclusion in the Russell will still be a positive thing, given that there are many more funds that track the Russell than the MSCI index. But because of the 5.3x higher weighting that UWMC will have in the MSCI index, this gives its inclusion some significant OOMPH (legitimate financial term). [Studies have shown](https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion) that when a stock moves from the Russell 1000 down to the Russell 2000 due to a reduction in its market cap, the share price tends to move *up* shortly thereafter, because now it is one of the top companies in its respective index (with a higher respective weighting) rather than one of the smallest.

TL;DR: it is better to be a BIG fish in a ^(small) (cap) index than to be a small fish in a large index. Thus, I believe we can anticipate good things ahead with UWMC’s inclusion in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index.",nj0cj6,[],1

Note I prefer higher time frames, like the monthly candles, because there is soo much noise on daily and weekly charts, 

Of course the confidence in a bull era, above higher time frames important moving averages adds confidence smaller time frames will resolve upwards.

Zooming in, friday 's bounce off bottom of formation, during 6x spike in volume. Nice try. This formation has proven rock solid over & over since March. Breaking it will take more than dumping 50,000,000 ounces in 5 minutes. Nowhere to go but up for now.

Because we see charts the way The Banks do.

2. Fed admits inflation may not be transitory

From fed : A number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and, if so, these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year.

Justput oil prices so you can expect CPI where :

3. Music stops for Silver nd Gold alternatives :

China opens its borders for gold imports. ( supportive for silver action )

Here is the Chinese offical goverment stance for Gold and silver from the following article so obvious . This is the first time saw that kind of bullish news . especially important that this news from Chinese official goverment declaration

[https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1224071.shtml](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1224071.shtml)

Social media platform some users call for switch to Gold which they said was more stable.

""I still expect a good gold price performance,"" he said, noting that investing in gold is convenient, while there is no formal way to invest in other assets .

Music stopped ! for gold and silver alternatives .

Still too complicated for many .

 

4. Big adds from SLV and PSLV this month the first after February almost 15 million ozz per month this is 2 % increase in total ETFS . Somebodies almost see the light

5.USD index ( DXY) breaking ;

One of the drivers for the next strong move up in silver will be the USD index (DXY) breaking below the Feb '18 low of 88.15 and descending into its 3yr cycle low. It is currently on calendar day 84 of the current intermediate cycle. They usual run 160-280 calendar days.

&#x200B;

 CPI inflation index is a poor historical tracker of the gold price. The pink dashed line below shows the cycle high price of $35/oz price from 1934 projected forward using CPI scaling. Clearly, M2 scaling with a mine-supply discount tracks the gold price much better. 

&#x200B;

Once this is all behind us, there should be a strong move up in gold into the summer. After that, I would expect the next big move in gold to be a push up to \~$3000 by mid-2022 .

7. Gold /silver Ratio :

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qx731gzxsu071.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3cb9f153d10fc7005f61f4baf19f14ca104c9f4

 

So silver will lead the metals and the gold/silver ratio, now at 67, will initially reach 30 like. The long term target is likely to be a lot lower, probably 15 or below. As talked before the expected Gold prices 3.000 usd in the mid of 2022 and with gold /silver ratio we can expect price range 150 -200 Usd /ozz which is x8 gain from actual 27.6 usd /ozz price .

&#x200B;

 

Now our tickets :

1. Physical Silver bars coins , or other stuff just as an example : The premiums are sky high so it is over . Spot at $28.15. Some internet sites  selling eagles for $44.28. Either something big is coming and they know it or someone selling this to you is wearing a ski mask. Either way, not sure why you would buy this product at this price.
2. PSLV Reaches $4 BILLION in Assets! 144,213,789 total ounces of Physical Silver  
53 million ounces of physical silver added in 2021 . Actually now only feasible alternative . Fully liquid and buy and sell in a second and also hedge yourself .
3. ZSİL ( swiss ) , or other European allocated ETFS .

My position : I have 1.700 ozz of physical silver

Nothing here is financial advice ............................................

Loves you all although got many negative comments and I want all you see this opportunity . Even mosts are not in . At leaast 5 /10 % add to your portfolio and play your usual stock or option games .

Lastly :

The fact that I'm seeing so few cheerleaders getting giddy about the upside in precious metals and miners is a welcome positive for further gains in the weeks and months ahead imho",nj5r35,[],0

You can find the last week's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nds2vh/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/rc961bm4hv071.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4701a99fd4471a560552f895ebcc817e72e334d3

GME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \[Redacted\] as a payment option.

Newcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \[redacted\], a new \[redacted\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.

**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker’s Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it’s slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.

**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford’s CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

**DraftKings** is an American daily fantasy sports contest (dfs), sports betting operator (sportsbook), and virtual casino platform (igaming). Essentially it's a fucking money pit for retards who have gambling addictions, and according to a [Harvard Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230631/#:~:text=Based%20on%20its%20analysis%20of,activities%20in%20the%20past%20year) conducted in fucking 1997, approximately 1% of adults have gambling addictions, I'm sure with todays ease of access, it's more like 2%, so, \~6.6 million retards are at severe risk to giving DraftKings their bank accounts. Like I said, this shit is a money pit, they provide a service that results in LITERAL FREE MONEY. Instead of driving to a casino, these geniuses at DraftKings are allowing some individuals to gamble from the comfort of their couch, it's amazing. Also, when I say retards, take that lightly last Saturday, I gambled away, and streamed myself in an undisclosed off-brand WSB discord, $500 in an online casino, and gamble on sports, daily, hell, last NFL season I finished first in the r/sportsbook betting contest. [PROOF (i love gambling)](https://imgur.com/gallery/woD8Vpu). With that said, if you like something buy it, if you love something invest in it. I love gambling, and will invest in the BEST *legal* sports book out there, DKNG, aka Donkey Kong, aka Donkey Dick, aka Dick Kings. :kek:

**SWOT ANALYSIS of Dick Kings**

**STRENGTHS:**

* Industry leaders: currently DKNG is legal in more [states](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/help/sports-betting/where-is-sports-betting-legal?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2Fhelp%2Fsports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal&wpcn=help&wpscn=sports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal) than any other sportsbook platform, they're legal in 11, with 2 on the brink of legalization, and a window of opportunity by eoy for the remaining 11 states where it is legal.
* Marketing/Advertising: if you're a sports guy, you'll noticed DKNG is fucking everywhere, you cant escape it. They're all over social media and are on every fucking commercial.  They spent 77% OF THEIR [REVENUE ON MARKETING PLATFORMS LMAO](https://www.actionnetwork.com/legal-online-sports-betting/draftkings-reports-increased-revenue-marketing-2020-earnings).
* Partnerships: They currently have a partnership with the NFL, UFC, MLB, three [NBA teams](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/02/draftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F&wpcn=about&wpscn=news%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F), and they own a [Nascar](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2021/05/20/draftkings-joins-nascar-star-bubba-wallace-23xi-racing/). Not only that, but Disney (ESPN) has a 6% stake in their company, yeah the largest sports network in America owns a [6% stake of DKNG.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17950769) (dont fuck with the mouse). They also have upcoming partnerships with Dish Network, and I'm sure they have a fuck ton of other promotions on the way.
* Ease of access: you literally type it in the browser, or download an app. Deposit you wage cuck check through paypal or via debit card and within 1 hour your entire check could be gone, it's that easy.
* UI: You know how everyone says, ""oh don't use robinhood, it's bad, it's so cancer, they sell your data."" Shut the fuck up, you know that UI is fucking sexy and that's why you keep buying FDs that's the same shit with DKNG. I've used hundreds of online casinos and sportsbook, personally bovada is my go to, but for legal books, DraftKings is by far the best, no question. That platform is sexy, look how clean this is compared to fanduel.

**WEAKNESSES:**

* They care too much, and try to hard to make as much money as possible? wtf? you thought imma drop actual weaknesses, imma straight shill. No thanks LMAO. Fan Duel, Barstool sportsbook is straight trash. dafuq.

**OPPORTUNITIES:**

* State Legalizations, currently there are only 24 states where sportsbooks, igaming is legal, but it's expected to be legal nationwide in the next 1-3 years. Maryland, Nevada, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and New York are on the brink of having DKNG in their states. I know a few of those states legalize literally just last week.
* Partnerships, with the amount of money DraftKings is spending, they're going to have deals with the NHL, NBA and possibly even some college ball in the next few months. I wouldn't be surprised to see DKNG become the official sportsbook of the NFL in the future. I know a few [stadiums](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.giants.com/news/draftkings-and-new-york-giants-announce-official-exclusive-sports-betting-deal) offer DKNG sportsbook in stadium, and I think this will become the norm in the next few years. You'll be able to go to a ballpark, stadium and place your bet directly there right next to your $40 beer (cause inflation).
* Social Media. I think where it stands right now, if you google DraftKings, their social media platform is okay, but in the next few months, especially near NFL season, it'll absolutely explode. They obviously have a facebook, twitter accounts, instagram and they are extremely interactive, they have daily podcasts and shit, but that's all so new. Their accounts are all growing, and I know as their social media presence becomes established, their brand name will grow as well.
* Buyouts, again, as a I said above Disney has a 6% stake in DKNG, I wouldn't be surprised to see Disney too onto their ownership and possible even buyout Draft Kings, I mean, imagine that. Disney, ESPN and DraftKings, all under the same parent company. That would be insane. You don't see Barstool (Penn), or Fanduel with that kind of opportunity.
* Igaming, I think this platform is so slept on. Virtual casinos are the fucking future, let me tell you, I've been doing this shit for years and once you legal bros get into this shit, you'll be hooked. There's absolutely nothing better than sitting your fat ass on the couch and blowing through hundreds of dollars betting martingale on black 7 times in a row. SHIT IS FUCKING GREAT. If they can develop a strong Igaming presence, they'll be loaded. Igaming is \~$[250 billion industry](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/gaming-market-2020-2025-size-share-trends-growth-value-and-research-report-2021-03-03?tesla=y#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,Mobile)

**THREATS:**

* Their only threat is competition, which is actually a strength because their competition is dog water. Barstool Sports can't get a partnership with the largest revenue sport, the NFL, because the NFL commish Roger Goodell absolutely hates the face of Barstool, aka Portnoy. I love Portnoy, but guy is a week away from some fucked up-cocaine induced canceling, I'm telling you. Barstool will entertain the stoolies, but they'll never become the Mcdonalds of fastfood, they'll always be the fucking nasty ass trash Burger King that you have to go to because the Mcdonalds line is too long. Fanduel is owned by a UK company, what do they know about American sports. WHAT COMPETITION.

Anyway, as you can see their revenue grew a dick-ton. The big scary here is their net is horrible, why, the big no no? Sales and Marketing. I was worried about that too, but that's their game plan, to a spend a fuck ton of money to game market dominance early on, retention rate is key to this industry. Jason Robbins their CEO said it on a [podcast the other day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93aGVyZXRoZW1vbmV5aXMubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/Nzg3ZDM1Y2QtMTgxYS00ODBhLTllZGMtMzFmZDdlNWNlMTIx?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwisjdvGtt7wAhWKUt8KHVAoCCkQjrkEegQIBBAI&ep=6), they're in preseason, training camp in this market. They're still warming up to the full opportunity.

So to touch upon their spending again, as you can see their spending is working. They gained new degens at a rate of 114% compared to the first quarter of 2020. INSANE GROWTH. They're growing and retaining rates at a crazy level.

[more good. less bad.](https://preview.redd.it/ezqljieg3w071.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=690df56ebd62a93b9ec73feaad69223f02f07997)

tl;dr REVENUE PUMP. They're expected to blow revenue out of the water, shit is going full parabolic. Raising revenue guidance to $1.15 billion,

DKNG only has access to 25% of the U.S. population as of right now, and the stock is at what $45, what till this shit nation wide.

No dilution until $135 a share, and you aren't buying this absolute diamond right now? wtf.

**Price Targets**

DKNG is sitting pretty right above their low price target at $42.00, and you aint buying? Look at these price targets, a ceiling of $105.

&#x200B;

**Institutional Ownership**

Look at the dates of filing and values. A lot of the media is shitting on Cathie Woods for buying DKNG religiously, but nobody is shitting on BlackRock for owning over 8million shares. As a wise man once told man, BlackRock is the United States testicles, they are the balls of this country. If they buy something, you know that shit is going to cum to the moon. It's insane how many of these big names are buying right now.

**Technical Analysis** so I hate to be the guy, but this is the [only stock I've traded all year](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/).

SHORT TERM(1-3 months):

[wedge, no vol.](https://preview.redd.it/ueoiofxw3w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=0806df6ce5521a17081b3a632be2b02361c355e4)

As you can see from the chart above, we're currently trading in between the 7d sma and 50d sma on the 2hr. This is most likely complete confirmation bias, but I backed tested when DKNG has a daily closed inbetween this same crunch since it drooped the spac name, and whenever it has this same set up, these are the next day, and or two day returns.

02/10 +10.48% , 03/04 +13.89% , 03/25 +1.62% , 07/16 +9.46% , 09/09 +9.11% , 11/05 +9.05% , 1/08/21 +4.48% ,3/10/21 +11.48% , 04/26/21 +1.91%

Try it yourself. This is actually the reason why I bought weeklies eod friday. Check my positions at the top. I think in the next few weeks, DKNG will go to that top level resistance line at \~49.5, and then it could trade sideways for a bit longer to fill that volume gap from 44.5 to 49.5, but I do think a pump day is coming nonetheless.

&#x200B;

LONG TERM(3-12 months):

[Support \/ Meme Line](https://preview.redd.it/014ln9o04w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=845d45afafea0c86a25b60729e5039fb328d1c45)

[RSI oversold](https://preview.redd.it/lsnl6oo34w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=f843db525edb8cac78c82849e727b6dac367a342)

[MACD reversal](https://preview.redd.it/o62fqra44w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=f65a6cc9e82f4f82abc03614eebe3d34d9a3b34b)

So, longterm (3-12 month window), referring to the chart at the top, it looks like DKNG has found support off the 35.5 bottom it hit in September, there's massive volume support at the 42.5 line, and that looks to be the new floor (god forbid a market crash happens soon, plz no fomc june 18th taper tantrum). It looks like the next major test for DKNG is at the 200d SMA or 51.52. If you look at RSI, it's leaving oversold territory, and MACD is flashing a reversal. I think we're due for a next wave of highs on DKNG. I could see this popping to \~49.5-51.5 -> \~60 -> all time highs. TA is looking dumb bullish you fucking idiots. Buy this shit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**CONCLUSION**

in conclusion, I fucking love the stock. Technical and Fundamentals showing a strong buy. Dick Kings is about to cum, and be sure you're there to catch the cum, because once this thing is near it's edge, it's going to absolute nut. I know I wont want to miss suc.. am I gay? anyway. buy dkng.

TL;DR I might be gay now, but buy DKNG, Shit looks like an absolute steal. Later nerds **$DKNG 100c 1/21/22** [POSITIONS HERE I AM AUTISTIC](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://imgur.com/gallery/7ZK85CN)",njaa8g,[],0

Dear redditers.

The day of our victory is coming. Those who did not believe in Virgin Galactic must hide in their caves. The day of payment is coming, this will be our personal vendetta. Thousands of people shorting SPCE shares were counting not only on the failure of the company itself, but the failure of all mankind efforts. This profit-driven attempt to sink the company must be punished. Therefore, I am calling you all to a crusade against these people. We can achieve this together by bumping Virgin's price on Monday through our own efforts and also by encouraging others to do so. Let all enemies of mankind know that their actions do not pay off and will be remembered. Up for battle and see you on Monday at 9:30 AM (UTC-5).

Our victory will be their defeat!",njbcbs,['SPCE'],0
