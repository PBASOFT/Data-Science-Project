# What to expect next

The issue of greenhouse gas emissions will continue to concern regulators in Europe and around the world. It will also lead to additional laws and regulations that will affect companies, particularly in the fields of energy, industry and manufacturing, and aviation.

[On May 24–25, the European Council will convene for a special meeting](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/european-council/2021/05/24-25/) to discuss the issue of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, and provide further guidance on the issue. It is likely that the meeting will have an impact on the price of carbon.

[Analysts disagree about the rate of growth in the price of carbon](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/18/why-europes-carbon-market-is-experiencing-a-boom-like-never-before.html), Some claim it will continue to climb throughout the year to levels of over 100 euros per tonne, and some claim it will stabilize at around 40 in the coming year but will grow slowly until it at least doubles by the end of the decade.

It is worth following the reports and new regulations from government bodies in Europe and around the world, and pay attention to any new regulation that will directly affect Carbon activity and price.

As a result of the jump in the price of carbon, it is likely that we will see changes in companies that produce gas emissions. Especially from the energy-production, and aviation sectors, as well as the growth of companies that offer greener solutions.

[In addition, last year, China, too, committed ](https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/china-considers-going-carbon-neutral-peaking-emissions/)to significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and will reach Net-Zero Emissions by 2060.

486,2021-05-25,investing," **Two things to start:**

1. I am not a financial advisor. What follows in my interpretation after doing much research and consulting with my broker. Consult yours before making any decisions.
2. I own 102,500 shares currently. I really don't care if they go up or down over the next few weeks. They will be worth the same regardless as I plan to hold until the Bankruptcy exit plan is concluded unless the price breaks $12.

**Now, what you came here for:** How much will I be paid for my shares of Hertz when Hertz executes its exit plan?

**There a 3 parts of the pay out:**

**1)** You will be paid $1.53 cash for each share, plus

**2)** Each shareholder will get an equity distribution on a prorated bases of 3% of the total purchase price of the entire company. Roughly $1.00 per share, plus

**3)** Then there are the warrants. A little complicated, but hope you follow. Exact wording from the agreement: ""Each Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholder, has the right, but not the obligation, subject to and in accordance with the Rights Offering Procedures, to be eligible to subscribe for up to one (1) Rights Offering Share per 0.9554 shares of Existing Hertz Parent Interests that it holds, at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, subject to the individual limits included in the calculations in Item 2 of this Subscription Form."" So for example on 100 shares you would get (100/.9554) = 104.6682018002931. Which becomes 104 warrants because all rounding is down downward. Each warrant can then be purchased for $10. Here is the tricky part. You can convert by exercising the warrant, or you can sell the warrant itself. For this example we are going to sell the warrant. And here is why nobody can give you a concrete answer because the value of the warrant is COMPLETE SPECULATION. For my example I am going to assume that the new Hertz, with its reduced debt structure and red hot rental market, will get back to a pre-pandemic level of $20 per share. So you could sell each warrant for a $10 profit. ($20 share price less the $10 warrant purchase.) *Just a note: HTZ traded for as high as $46/share in the good times, which is what the new HTZ will be entering. The good times. Low debt. Hot market.*

**So here is the math on 100 shares:**

1. $1.53 cash out (x) 100 = $153 **+**
2. $1.00 equity distribution (x) 100 = $100 **+**
3. 104 shares times $10 profit **=** $1040

Total income from you 100 shares would be $153 + $100 + $1040 = $1293. or **$12.93/share.**

If you currently owned the 100 shares for todays close price of $6.39 you investment is $639.

So staying it thru until the exit plan concludes and selling your warrants would net you $654 ($1293-$639).

**This is why I say I'm a bull on this stock. I believe that the total value of each HTZGQ share is really somewhere between $13-$20 per share. I will not sell unless the $HTZGQ crosses the $12 line before the exit plan is executed. Most estimates you see assume being able to modestly sell your warrants for about $15 per share. Which means a price of around $7-8 ($1.53+$1+$5 warrant profit=$7.53) is the total value. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SEVERE UNDERVALUE.**

***But regardless, lets just say that the $7-8 is the call. you have a more than 20% upside in the current price of $6.39.***

949,2021-05-25,investing,"Amazon’s latest movement is an acquisition of MGM holdings for $9 billion. That would be the biggest acquisition since Whole Foods. We believe it would be the key growth catalysis for its Amazon Prime subscription and possibly impact deeply into its advertisement business.

**What is Metro Goldwyn Mayer, Inc. – MGM**

[**https://khfungco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mgm-logo.jpg**](https://khfungco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mgm-logo.jpg)

If you don’t recall what MGM is, the photo above should ring some bells by nowMGM is one of Hollywood’s most famous movie producers, with its lion logo at the beginning of every movie that they made. It includes James Bond, Rocky, recently Tomb Raider, and A Star is Born.

For most people, that means if the e-commerce giant successfully acquires MGM, all those movies will be on Amazon Prime Video on demand. It is good for all those prime users, including myself.

**What Does It Mean To An Investor**

[**https://khfungco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Streaming-Services.png**](https://khfungco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Streaming-Services.png)

Amazon already has Prime Video, why they still need to buy another one you might ask. It buys talented movie makers instead of buying a company. However, this pandemic gave both Amazon and MGM a second thought. For MGM, they are unable to release movies in theaters. In fact, they have already sold some of their movies to streaming services. The pandemic hit the movie industry very badly. On the other hand, Amazon has a hard time making some successful movie in-house. If you don’t believe it, can you name one movie that it has made? Still, they are one of the biggest streaming service providers.

**Amazon Prime**

[**https://khfungco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Amazon-Prime-services-as-reason-for-subscription-according-to-subscribers-in-the-United-States-as-of-2020.png**](https://khfungco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Amazon-Prime-services-as-reason-for-subscription-according-to-subscribers-in-the-United-States-as-of-2020.png)

In 2021, there are around 150 million Amazon Prime users in the US, and most of the people join the membership because it offers free one-day shipping locally. This is followed by the second is for the Amazon Prime Video. It’s total revenue for the quarter ending 31 March 2021 was almost $110 billion, over 40% increased year over year. If all 150 million Prime members stayed for one year, it contributed over 17 billion. That would be 15% of the company’s total revenue. If more than half of the people join Prime because of its streaming service, we believe the acquisition of MGM would boost the Prime subscription number to a new high.

The $9 billion seems too much for acquiring a company studio. However, if you compared the $11 billion spent on video and music content in 2019; the cost of the first season Lord of the Rings series ($465 million), the acquisition now would be considered as a very good deal for Amazon.

**The Advertisement Network**

Compared with Facebook or Google, the Amazon advertisement network is still very small. However, the potential is hard to ignore. Amazon’s advertisement business is generating nearly $7 billion in just a quarter and it keeps growing, it is nearly 80% growth from last year. MGM not only put movies into the theater, but it also has a global-based TV network. The acquisition of MGM would give amazon the tool to test out their advertising serving or targeting capabilities and reach more potential Amazon Prime users worldwide.

**Amazon Web Services – AWS**

For most people, Amazon is just an e-commerce company. However, every investor should know, it is much more than that. Amazon Web Services, also known as AWS, is the biggest cloud service provider worldwide. In fact, this website is being hosted on AWS. AWS delivered over $13 billion in revenue, contributing over 12% of the total revenue. Amazon Prime Video is steaming from AWS which means it can also help Amazon to lower the taxable income by deducting the cost of using AWS services. However, we believe the cloud services growth rate would be slower, yet AWS would remain the dominant company of cloud computing services.

**Overweight**

Amazon is gaining more share in e-commerce due to the pandemic. The cloud services would be the new cash cow, money-making machine, and the Prime Video is believed to drive the Prime subscription number to a new high.",nkn744,[],0
