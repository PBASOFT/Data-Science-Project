At this point, given your history your seeing ALL of your failures and absolutely none of your successes. I'd say given your setbacks and where you came from; landing a six figure salary is a HUGE win-win. 

As to the investment strategy I can't really help there. I'm sorry. I too am in a tough spot, where indexing probably isn't going to do me much good. I'm a bit over 50 and disable-y retired. So far, I've not lost any money and can even boast of some small gains, but nowhere near the SICK GAINS some of these folks have shown, But I also know I don't have the risk tolerance nor the money to take risky bets. All I can do is keep trying and invest in companies I believe in; backed of course by those companies that are profitable. 

Initially, I was hugely disappointed by my returns, especially watching all these meme stocks become high fliers while the stocks I chose were either stagnant or had little gains. I started to question what I was doing wrong. And still do. But when things started to change in the market the companies that I had chosen handled all the negativity in the market much better than the high flyers. 

I have also noted the stock market is like a huge game. The media is used to create fear, doubt, and any other kind of negative emotion to make one question his/her market picks. All I can do is continue to learn, not take any huge risks, and KEEP trying. 

Maybe try just dipping your toes back in; instead of trying to just get Right back to it.

Experiment and see what works and what doesn't. Readjust and continue to move forward. 

The only reason I responded was not to give financial or market advice because I have None, but to possibly help you see that Not everything you've done has been a failure.

The F-150 looks fantastic and starts at $58K. Similar to the Cybertruck pricing and compared to the hummer $110K it seems like a steal. 

They are bringing a higher performing electric vehicle that a lot more people can afford. I hope it continues and if successful they could be the leading manufacturer of electric vehicles in the US soon. 

I think a price point of $15 or so with a market cap of $58 billion seems reasonable to me over the next year or so. Maybe it does hit that $20 if actually the leader in the US in a couple years. Not crazy.

But often and especially in this weird post-corona market, companies' performance don't seem to have the exact correlation to their stock performance, with many companies overbloated in price with future expectations priced-in.  

As a stock,, Volkswagen's (Vz, not St) forward P/E right now is 7.5. Tesla is at 127 and Nio isn't even poised to make a profit apparently. Comparing P/S ratio, Nio is at 11.77, Tesla is at 15.1, and Volkswagen is at 0.53.    

If Volkswagen and Herbert Deiss can implement their plans of becoming a fully top-down tech-first auto company with everything in-house (and being in the industry I have some idea of how serious VW is at not being dependent on literally anyone especially for their software and services, as they see that as the key differentiator in an electric era), the revaluation of the stock price alone should make up a large portion the growth I'm looking for.

Thus, their focus isnt necessarily more sales, its margins and it will take very little change in margin, to move the bar. 

The reason for that is their margins are historically thin. But that also means that even a slight improvement, of say 2-3% in net, would push the stock to double if they can just maintain that for a couple of years. This is all they need to do. So the question you need to ask is will eV's increase margins? And if so, by how much?

Historically, ICE margins are very small and most companies today are lucky to see 5%. So a change of 2-3% is huge. See what I mean? Its not like a startup which has to show 30%-50% rev growth for 10 years straight.

I think the switch to eV's will definitely increase margins. At first it will be slight but the margins will grow every year for the next decade and they will grow by a lot, to the tune of maybe 1% per year as sales increase. I also think that due to Fords legacy in trucks, they will be able to command a premium to everyone else thanks to 3rd party support, ease of repair, and low cost of ownership. 

I also think that in time, fleets management software will indeed become a major thing. As we move more and more to online shopping, efficient delivery will become insanely critical as Amazon has pointed out time and time again. Thus there will be enterprise software profits to be made for those that have a lot of vehicles in the enterprise space... which is likely going to be Ford though Rivian currently has a nice path with Amazon specifically right now.

To quote my favorite fictional animated scientist (who was quoting my favorite animated scientist's sidekick) ""that just sounds like slavery with extra steps"".  Now, hardcore fundamental investors will have issues investing in companies that show no intention of paying a dividend, because that is truly how profits are returned to ownership of a public company. 

Which, and let's open another can of worms, is why a lot of people, myself included, have issues with corporations using their cash generated from operations on stock buybacks.   The reason boards and executives do this is to increase the value of their own stock options or argue treasury shares to award themselves at a later time.   

When a Company buys its own stock on the open market, it drives the price of the shares up.   Now, you might say ""that's good for owners"", but only if they sale.  If the shares are either awarded out later or used to fulfill exercised stock options, then there is no net effect for owners who held throughout that period.  If, instead, the Company pays a dividend with the money it would have used for the buy back, all owners benefit equitably.  

Here in lies the heart of what makes wallstreet a crooked game.   It doesn't do what it's ment to do anymore,  pay ownership it's share of net income.   The companies that pay regular dividends are far and few between and are pretty much just the dinosaurs of the blue chip echelon.

If you set a limit BUY order at 100.5 and a limit SELL order 101.5?

>Now let’s say it goes up to $700 way before January. How much profit do you make?

A lot. It's impossible to calculate cause it matters when it happens, how quickly it happens, and how much above 700. But yes, if you buy a 590C today and tsla skyrockets to 700 by next month, you'll make a decent amount of profit.

> Do you lose more the closer it gets?

Yes, this is called theta decay. Think of it as how likely it is for a call to reach the strike. If you have a 590 strike for tomorrow and another for jan of 2022, theta will decay much faster for tomorrow's call cause it's much less likely to hit 590 vs hitting 590 in jan 2022.


> Also is the break even price exactly how it sounds? So if it’s $697 break even, I would only profit after $697?

The breakeven is a misleading statistic because it only matters on day of expiration. If your b/e is 697, it means on day of expiration, if tesla is below 697, you'll lose money on your initial purchase. however, tesla can be at 697 way before your call expires and you'll make a profit.",[],0

A bunch of the VW evs were the same way but they started to get the picture and went out and developed a custom EV frame so I'm holding out hope with them.

Fords strategy is not new in the EV world.  They just happen to be doing it with a pickup truck.  They've probably learned a few lessons from the others which may make their product marginally better but the premise is still there.  

You are going to have a very tough time making an EV from the frame of an ICE vehicle.   Especially when you try to start adding the same computer electronics that Tesla has.  It just doesn't fit in the same frame.

I bought into the local electric company and Ford, because I was sure that Electric Vehicles were going to be huge, and make me money. Welp. My Ford stock is still under water and I keep it as a reminder. Yes, there is such a thing as being too far ahead of the game. I've also learned to sell the cycles with 'cyclical stocks' such as automotive and oil. They go up 100%, then eventually go back down 50% (to the same price where you bought in) then they go back up. Holding long-term can get you absolutely nothing over the long term. And there is no reason you need to sell 100% of your shares in any company. Not a bad idea to keep some shares, maybe 5-25%. I sold out of AAPL, AMZN, PCLN etc. back when they were almost penny stocks. Sure, I sold out of some companies before they went bankrupt, but you can only lose 100% of your position. The maximum you can gain is technically infinity, but for the stocks mentioned, we'll say 10,000+%.

So I don't personally disagree on the vehicle appeal at all... but somehow GM remains the volume leader among US automakers. So the proof is in the data that at least their customers like what they are making.

From a management bench, GM has a strong leadership team, led by Mary Barra who's been in that chair for 7 years and is doing a great job. They had a smart CFO that was snapped up by Stripe. BTW I personally believe pre-bailout GM was not a well run company, but the leadership brought in during the auto-bailout fundamentally changed GM for the better.

They made smart investments (Cruze), exited struggling brands (Pontiac, Saturn), exited markets that weren't working well (Europe), and entered new growth markets (China). Today's GM isn't the old one. 

Ford on the other hand still has heavy family influence in who leads and the direction of the company (Bill Ford is Exec Chairman). Frankly that influence isn't great from an outcomes standpoint. They terminated several CEOs who were very effective (Nasser, Fields). They hired (IMHO) a totally unqualified person to be CEO (Hackett). Now they have yet another CEO who has only been in the chair for 6 months. Yes they have big plans now - but the last guy also had big plans. To me the execution - outside of Alan Mullaly- has not been great. They invested in Chariot, and shut it down - but what were the learnings and next moves? There are other data points.

Then look at the stock returns for GM and Ford. On a 5 year return, Ford is -5%. GM is +82%. The market story says it all. Confidence in what GM is doing and lack thereof for Ford. I dumped my Ford shares shortly after Hackett took over and I don't regret it for a second.

Standard disclaimer, I'm not a financial guy at all and I eat crayons or what not.  
My thesis:  
Roughly last decade or so, under Hackett, Ford executives realized a few things.  
1) Too many platforms = rollout is slow, design cycles too long.  
2) Too many loss making platforms = High ASP Customer moved from compact cars to SUVs.  
3) Other traditional automakers are ahead of them in EV transition. The Bolt, the Prius, the Mirai.  
So the strategy is this:  
1) Consolidate platforms : Faster factory retooling to adjust to market demands, better supply chain control  
2) Remove bad products  
3) Invest in Electrification.  
4) Keep market share in which they are already a leader in. That's Ford Transit (best selling commercial van) and F150. Both are among the first ford EVs (Outside of the mach-E, which they actually purchase the motors and etc, so it's closer to assembling a car, rather than designing it). The F150 lightning will have a motor that is designed in house, and probably cost less to build that to buy.  
More:   
All of these are not regular day to day decisions. These are all company shakeup level reorganization and rethinking from the top down. This is basically Ford 2.0, or whatever version they are on right now. To use a historical valuation on this new ford company is going to be a bit difficult. They are probably at  the 30% to 50% mark in the reinvention of their company so we might soon see them reap profits.  
Further out:  
When the E-transit hit the shelves, they will have more emission room to push their traditional line up in europe a little more. The Mustangs were selling a lot higher than it has to today because of the emissions. The mustang also has a huge cult following in the EU as it does in the U.S, it is not an easy feat as there are lots of amazing competition from across the pond.  
However,  
That said, the execution still needs to be improved. The Explorer launch in 2019 was poorly handled.  
The lack of new models hurt Ford sales in APAC, until the new mustang mach-e came in, they had many quarters of declining sales in China, which is the largest growing auto market and second largest auto market.   
There is risk associated with their justifiably huge debt in the ford credit arm (they take on loans to let their customers borrow against). Rising interest rate for example, could hurt their profitability in the long run.  
I hope they don't fumble with the F150 lightning, or it would be another long decade.   
TLDR: If I treat Ford as an entirely new company with no history of their successes or failings, I'd buy this stock at a lot higher price. There are risks to it, but at this current price point I'm cautiously optimistic",[],0

>Its time and energy could be better spent on developing a driver monitoring system for Autopilot to significantly improve the safety and usefulness of that system.

No. Just no. Cameras on the driver isn't going to make their systems ""safer"" or more ""useful"".

For all the situations that FSD is advertised to be used in, and many that it isn't, their systems do an A+ job at both piloting the vehicle and alerting the driver to take over when the AI isn't confident what to do.

Auto-Steer and Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, often referred to together as Autopilot, can't drive _everywhere_, but the number situations they can handle extremely well is impressive. Freeways have been a solved problem for Tesla for years. Lane changes, also solved for freeways and city streets. Stop signs, street lights, construction zones, speed limit signs, all solved with vision -- the car will come to a complete stop at a stop sign without intervention, or would slow down and alert the driver when entering a construction zone. Even roads with poor or no lane markings are handled quite well. If the car isn't confident, it prompts the driver to take over. It's a PHENOMENAL system.

Only uniformed people who hear ""Autopilot"" and jump to the conclusion that it should be able to take you from A to B without intervention complain. Nobody is claiming that it does that. It's a driver _assist_ system, it's not a replacement for a driver.

I've heard ""news"" reports of driverless crashes or of someone riding in the backseat w/o a driver, and I call B.S. Nobody is stupid enough to believe that is safe to do today. It's a prank, someone is getting paid to give Tesla bad press, and risk their life in the process. You can't get to your destination from the backseat, at best it would get off a freeway and stop in the off-ramp and wait for the driver to accelerate. If you're circumventing all the seatbelt checks, hand on wheel checks, seat sensor checks with special tools and claiming that a reasonable person would do all that and then climb over the seats without opening doors and think that what they are doing is remotely safe, you're straight up trolling.

First trade was BS - BearsStern after JPM announced the take over at 10 per share. Second trade was LEH. If you don’t know history then you’ll have to go find that ticket. 

I started tracking since 1/1/2009. Since then I averaged 8.18% a year. But the portfolio value as a whole about 30% a year. 

Up until 2014 I was an “expert stock picker”. By expert I mean I have nothing better to do that watch and read market news blogs etc. everyday I got my Schwab trading platform up on my second screen picking the next big stock. I was relatively flat and way underperforming a simple SPY(VOO). After 2014 I stopped looking and went 90% funds and ETFs. I had to because I started working for a real investment firm and I need to preclear all my stock trades. For my 10% stocks...I do semi annual rebalance to buy or sell. That has greatly helped the performance compared to when I was actively trading. 


Mistakes I learned: 
* don’t trust business news when they make recommendations. The experts that makes them don’t actually always believe it. Sometimes the show producer ask if they can make a case. 
* we always end up holding losers longer than we should and sell winners earlier than we should. - new rule 50% loss triggers an exit. Winners stay until the signals goes negative  
* figuring out how much to buy is just as hard - I started applying a risk control to the stocks.  I would split 10,000 to 4 sectors. Then buy them based on market cap. So large cap gets a higher weight within my 25,000 sector. 

How I am handling the recent drops? I sleep like a baby. I never experienced a drop larger than 4% on a given day. Even on the worst days....well that 4% is a 0.4% hit on my total portfolio. The rest of my assets are nicely allocated globally and across different asset classes.",[],0

Im long on tesla, but that makes no sense. They still make most of their money by selling credits to the big automakers that dont make enough clean vehicles. Tesla produces a tiny fraction of cars compared to the big auto companies. When those companies stop needing the credits, Tesla has to start doubling their market year after year just to keep up with that huge source of revenue. There is no way they dont want and even need big contracts-- they have to grow faster at the same time that their biggest cash cow will be going away (not coincidentally, along with real competion in the EV space as well).",['TSLA'],1
