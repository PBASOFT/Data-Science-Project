62,2021-05-21,stocks,Can someone explain to me how a stock can be 104% of shares held by institutions? I own a stock and my brokerage app said 101% of shares held by institutions last week- today it now says 104% I tried researching how that could be but Im still not understanding- what i got out of it is that it’s either shorted or the data isn’t current? I don’t get how the percentage would go up if the data wasn’t current. If it is a heavily shorted stock can someone give me some insight on what the potential outcome of that high of institutional ownership would be? Just curious about what might happen in a situation like that. Thank you!,nhtgv6,[],1
67,2021-05-21,stocks,Never seen this before but I wondered if an of you all have experienced this before. Short info is a company was shorted and almost immediately was halted for a fundamental issue and it will take a long time to sort it out and be un-halted. Like 6-9 months is the ball park.,nhtim8,[],0
128,2021-05-21,stocks,So I am invested in a couple of companies and watching several others and one thing I have noticed is the graph for all of these companies is nearly identical. Like if there is a dip in the middle of the day for one stock there will be a dip for all of them. What causes this? I know it takes massive amounts of money to move a stock even just a little so in order for there to be a huge dip a lot of people would have to sell at the exact same time. Like within 30 minutes. How would that many people decide to sell all at the same time?,nhtory,[],0

464,2021-05-21,stocks,"So I've been reading the past few hours and I'm having trouble seeing how double tops and upward triangles are related (if at all). This started out with me seeing that COST had a double top flagged on FINVIZ, so I looked it up because I was curious. Turns out that's an indicator that it may fall significantly (If I recall correctly), but upward triangles are indications of a bullish trend. Just thinking about how they are defined/identified, it seems reasonably likely that double tops would appear in the formation of an upward triangle, yet they indicate almost completely opposite things. My guess is that a double top with decreasing support may more likely point to a bearish trend while a double top with increasing support could be the beginnings of an upward triangle.",nhvqyq,[],0

The fundamentals are either great or flawed depending on how you look at it. People will always need to eat. However, (in the UK at least), the government is becoming increasingly concerned about the fast food industry, and has imposed taxes and other restrictions on fast food corporations in the past.
