171,2021-05-18,stocks,"Let's simplify the issue to a basic example. This is usually a good way to get the crux of the question.

Let's say I establish a shell company and I contribute 100k in cash to shareholder equity. Nothing else. If I were to sell this shell company, I would always receive 100k for that company, as it has 100k in cash in assets and 100k in shareholder equity (let's not assume transactional costs, value of the name or anything else, let's just look at the balance sheet). Any owner could immediately reduce the equity by 100k and pay himself 100k in cash. Therefore the company is worth 100k. Owning the company is essentially the same as owning 100k in cash.

Now let's say that instead I use the company to buy back 50% of the shares from me for 50k. I will receive 50k in cash, the company receives 50% of its shares. If I were now to sell the company, I would get 50k for it, as the company has 50k in cash in assets and 50k in equity. The fact that the company could sell 50% of its shares means nothing for its valuation. Just as the technical fact, that the company could raise 1M or 1B does not make the shell company worth 1M or 1B. If it did raise 1B in cash, yes its valuation would go to 1B, but not just because it owns its own shares.

If in this example the company had retained its valuation of 100k after buying back 50% of its shares for 50k, I would have just made 50k out of thin air. As I physically received 50k for selling my shares to the company, yet still own the entire company. It's not logical that I just increased my wealth by doing nothing else than exchange shares with my own company.

Honestly this is beyond ludicrous where this sub has gotten to. If a company uses its cash to decrease share holder equity, thereby returning wealth to its shareholders, fundamentally the valuation of the company goes down. How could anyone think it wouldn't? If a company pays dividend from its cash, their valuation goes down. If a company pays wages to its employees, the valuation of the company goes down. It's a cost to the company. Money leaving the company. It's a 1-1 change between cash outflow and valuation.

Now, obviously investor sentiment and other factors not fundamentally tied to the balance sheet of the company have an effect on valuations on a stock market. Raising cash could scare away previous investors or it could create stronger belief in its growth. Paying investors through dividends or share buybacks could both improve the return on assets or it could put the company in trouble (liquidity issues, hamper growth etc). But what I am assuming here is that board decisions regarding capital allocations are (near) optimal and marginal changes in capital structure do not have a fundamental underlying impact on the company. All that changes is cash on hand.",gyjen23,t1_gyhqcz2,[],0

These are some highlights of the most shocking adaptations.

U.S. law has long prohibited American companies from turning over data to Chinese law enforcement. But Apple and the Chinese government have made an unusual arrangement to get around American laws.

In China, Apple has ceded legal ownership of its customers’ data to Guizhou-Cloud Big Data, or GCBD, a company owned by the government of Guizhou Province, whose capital is Guiyang. Apple recently required its Chinese customers to accept new iCloud terms and conditions that list GCBD as the service provider and Apple as “an additional party.” Apple told customers the change was to “improve iCloud services in China mainland and comply with Chinese regulations.”

China hide process’

In early 2018, Guo Wengui, an exiled Chinese billionaire, was spending much of his time in Manhattan trying to broadcast his claims of corruption inside the Communist Party. His latest effort was an iPhone app in China that delivered those claims.

Before his app even became available on iPhones, the Chinese government was trying to block it. Shortly after Mr. Guo applied to the App Store, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the government’s internet regulator, told Apple it wanted the app rejected. It was unclear how the officials knew about it.

Those events and the chain reaction they set off inside Apple were laid out in court documents last week in a wrongful-termination case against the company. The documents and interviews shine a light on a bureaucracy inside Apple designed to censor and block apps, often proactively, to appease the Chinese government.

On Feb. 4, 2018, shortly after the Chinese authorities demanded that Mr. Guo’s app be rejected, an Apple manager emailed a colleague with a question: Did Mr. Guo belong on Apple’s “China sensitivities list,” along with the likes of Falun Gong — the Chinese spiritual movement — and the Dalai Lama?

The colleague replied that Mr. Guo probably should be on the list, given that he had been spreading unverifiable defamatory stories about Chinese officials. She suggested that the question be elevated to Apple’s “executive review board,” a group of executives who decide the trickiest App Store issues, including top deputies to Mr. Cook.

Two weeks later, the board said Mr. Guo belonged on Apple’s China blacklist. Apple employees added his name to the company’s internal “Chinese App Store Removal wiki page,” according to the documents, as well as a software program that would automatically tag any apps that mentioned him.

Six months later, Mr. Guo submitted his app again, with changes to elude Apple’s software. Trieu Pham, an app reviewer in Cupertino, was assigned the app. He didn’t find anything that violated Apple’s rules. On Aug. 2, he approved it.

Three weeks later, Trystan Kosmynka, Apple’s app review chief, sent an email to several managers at 2:32 a.m. The subject line was “Hot: Guo.” The Chinese government had spotted Mr. Guo’s new app, and Mr. Kosmynka wanted to know how it had gotten published.

“This app and any Guo Wengui app cannot be on the China store,” he wrote, according to the emails filed in the court case. “Can we put the necessary pieces in place to prevent that ASAP.”

Apple pulled the app and began investigating. A resulting report said the app was published because the “China hide process was not followed,” according to court documents. It said that Mr. Pham, the app reviewer, should have sent the app to Apple’s Chinese language specialists, who had been trained on which topics to block in the Chinese App Store, including Mr. Guo.

When Apple managers questioned Mr. Pham, he told them the app didn’t violate any policies. The managers responded that the app criticized the Chinese government, Mr. Pham said in court documents, and that this was enough for rejection.

Six months later, Apple fired Mr. Pham. In response, he sued the company, accusing it of pushing him out to appease the Chinese government.

Apple said it removed Mr. Guo’s app in China because it had determined it was illegal there. Apple said it fired Mr. Pham because of poor performance.

Mr. Guo’s media outlets have a history of peddling misinformation. The exact nature of the apps in the 2018 case was unclear, though court documents said they discussed Chinese Communist Party corruption.

Phillip Shoemaker, who ran Apple’s App Store from 2009 to 2016, said in an interview that Apple lawyers in China gave his team a list of topics that couldn’t appear in apps in the country, including Tiananmen Square and independence for Tibet and Taiwan. He said Apple’s policy was matter-of-fact: If the lawyers believed a topic was off-limits in China, then Apple would remove it there.

On Chinese iPhones, Apple forbids apps about the Dalai Lama while hosting those from the Chinese paramilitary group accused of detaining and abusing Uyghurs, an ethnic minority group in China.

The company has also helped China spread its view of the world. Chinese iPhones censor the emoji of the Taiwanese flag, and their maps suggest Taiwan is part of China. For a time, simply typing the word “Taiwan” could make an iPhone crash, according to Patrick Wardle, a former hacker at the National Security Agency.

Sometimes, Mr. Shoemaker said, he was awakened in the middle of the night with demands from the Chinese government to remove an app. If the app appeared to mention the banned topics, he would remove it, but he would send more complicated cases to senior executives, including Mr. Cue and Mr. Schiller.

Apple resisted an order from the Chinese government in 2012 to remove The Times’s apps. But five years later, it ultimately did. Mr. Cook approved the decision, according to two people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Apple recently began disclosing how often governments demand that it remove apps. In the two years ending June 2020, the most recent data available, Apple said it approved 91 percent of the Chinese government’s app-takedown requests, removing 1,217 apps.

In every other country combined over that period, Apple approved 40 percent of requests, removing 253 apps. Apple said that most of the apps it removed for the Chinese government were related to gambling or pornography or were operating without a government license, such as loan services and livestreaming apps.

Yet a Times analysis of Chinese app data suggests those disclosures represent a fraction of the apps that Apple has blocked in China. Since 2017, roughly 55,000 active apps have disappeared from Apple’s App Store in China, according to a Times analysis of data compiled by Sensor Tower, an app data firm. Most of those apps have remained available in other countries.

An Increasing Number of Apps Are Disappearing in China

Number of apps that disappeared from the iOS App Store in China by month through February 2021
More than 35,000 of those apps were games, which in China must get approval from regulators. The remaining 20,000 cut across a wide range of categories. Apps that mapped users’ runs, edited selfies or taught sexual positions were removed. So were apps that allowed users to message privately, share documents and browse websites the Chinese government had blocked. More than 600 news apps also disappeared.

Apple disputed those figures, saying that some developers remove their own apps from China. Apple said that since 2017, it had taken down 70 news apps in response to Chinese government demands.

The discrepancy between Apple’s disclosures and the Times analysis is in part because Apple is removing apps before China’s internet censors even complain. Apple does not disclose such takedowns in its statistics.

Mr. Shoemaker said he and his team rationalized removing apps by framing them as simply enforcing a country’s laws. Similar steps were taken in places like Saudi Arabia and Russia, he said. “At the same time, we didn’t want to get hauled up in front of the Senate to talk about why we’re quote ‘censoring apps in China,’” he said. “It was a tightrope we had to walk.”",gyjhpbp,t3_nf1xgu,['AAPL'],1

I currently hold stocks of 5 companies, but I'm looking to add another 5 if an opportunity presents itself and if I have capital.

They're not going bankrupt, so I'm definitely not worried about them going to zero. 

If I hold 10 companies that are all different in terms of market cap, industry, capital structure, and value generation for shareholders, I'd consider that diversified, whereas if I owned ARK+FAANG, I wouldn't consider that particularly diversified regardless of the fact that that consists of a great many companies.

301,2021-05-18,stocks,"Don’t worry. It’s hard to see your investments go down, especially when you first start investing, but it’s perfectly normal. The market goes down half the time (literally) and something like 30% of all years lose money. It all even out over the long run (10+ years). Just take advantage of the opportunity to buy at a cheaper price (and higher yield).

Here are some things you can do to limit investing related anxiety.

1: invest in a globally diversified index fund. When our investments go down the biggest question we often ask is if there is something wrong with our strategy. Can’t go wrong if you own everything. All you need is to be bullish on the world.

2: check your portfolio less often. I only look at my portfolio when I deposit money, and on my stocks when the quarterly reports come out. Can’t worry about your stocks going down if you don’t know that they are down.

3: Look at your stocks as businesses. When you buy a stock you are entitled to a portion of their future earnings. If you buy a stock that yields you 5% a year, and it falls 50%, you can now buy it at a 10% yield. That’s twice as much money.

4: Limit your downside with alternative assets.  Assets like gold, commodities, consumer stables, liquidity providers, bonds or reits may lower your downside risk.

5: Understand that most stocks go down. I don’t know any long term investors that doesn’t have a losing stock in their portfolio. So it’s highly unlikely that everything you own will go up at the same time, even for a short period.

By understanding, I mean you've done tens of hours of research and you know most of what's going on in that specific market and/or company.

If you understand a market, but not the companies, you should buy an ETF. For example I've spent a lot of time researching the potential of genomics and understand it's a huge opportunity, but I don't understand the companies well enough to pick one or even a few companies, so I'm better off holding ARKG.

If you don't just understand the market, but also the companies you should just pick the best positioned company and not diversify at all. Unless you think there's a significant chance that you will be wrong, in which case you have to ask yourself if you truly understand the company.

If you don't understand the market at all, you shouldn't be investing in it in the first place. Not through an ETF or anything else (unless it's indirectly through an S&P index fund).

Obviously you can never be 100% sure a company or market will do well, but that's a part of investing. The goal is not to get it right 100% of the time, but to get it right most of the time. If you do that, you don't need to diversify past your ignorance.",gyjpy12,t3_neytcm,[],1

I gotta be honest, headlines like ""Tesla made more money from flipping than selling cars"" don't really add to investor confidence.

Elon is a brilliant engineer and yes he is one of he cofounders of Paypal. But I seriously question his knowledge on cryptocurrency.

For years, Elon was not a believer in crypto, and only changed his tune during the recent crypto bull-run.

Michael can keep ringing the alarm of the regulatory credits Tesla gets. But under a Biden admnistration,and an EV infrastructure bill under way, the government is not going to stop this practice anytime soon,and by the time they do Tesla will already be well positioned as an EV leader in a recovered economy to where they won't need them.

My assumption being that you have a million dollars after taxes, and no debts owed. The best place you can stick your money if you were trying to maintain that level of wealth, is in the stock market.

If you're not concerned with growing your wealth at some crazy multiple, buy a large ETF such as spy, QQQ, or one of the other ones that floats your boat.

These won't make you rich by any stretch of the imagination, but over a long period of time you will have more money then you started with because over long enough periods if time stocks only go up.

Can anyone actually make a bullish case for Tesla at this point? Their assets are 56 billion and their market cap is 555 billion. Their revenue is 52b. They have under 2% of the vehicle market. Compare this to GM who's got over 200 billion in assets, generates 120b+ in revenue, and their market cap is a mere 86b. It's just fucking nonsense.

So what you're saying at this point if you buy Tesla instead of GM is: ""I am more confident Muskdaddy can harvest $10 of value from $1 than GM can harvest $0.43 of value from $1.""

I think Elon Musk is pretty good and GM is not great, but I don't think he's 20x better. That's a HUGE target for GM to hit. Keep in mind, when we're talking about management of very large companies it's a pretty narrow band of difference in management capabilities. Shareholders and boards will pay top dollar for management that can harvest 1.1x or 1.2x more value from a dollar than their competitors. We're talking about the Alan Mulally's of the world. CEO's credited with turning around 2 or 3 companies.

The greatest businessmen of all time such as Rockefeller, Ford, Carnegie, Vanderbilt... these guys harvested between 2 and 3 times more value from a dollar than their contemporaries. And that made them the richest, most powerful men in the world capable of making and unmaking *entire nations* in their era.

In your Google example they did a 2-1 split with the payout being the newly created class of shares being the non-voting ones.  This gave everyone who owned Google the same number of non-voting shares as they had voting shares which is why the price stayed the same.  The reason they did this was insiders wanted to sell but they did not want to dilute their voting rights so they sold some of their newly created voting shares.  I believe that newly created stock options and grants given to employees are now the non-voting shares also to not dilute the voting stake the founders have.  

As for BRK here is the google summary:

Berkshire Hathaway has two classes of common stock designated Class A and Class B. In 2009, a share of Class B common stock has the rights of 1/30th of a share of Class A common stock except that a Class B share has 1/200th of the voting rights of a Class A share (rather than 1/30th of the vote).

For those who have never actually looked into this and are just taking some random media's word for it, Tesla doesn't market the system as ""self-driving"", they market it as follows:

> * Navigate on Autopilot
>* Auto Lane Change
>* Autopark
>* Summon
>* Full Self-Driving Computer
>* Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control

> The currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous. The activation and use of these features are dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of human drivers as demonstrated by billions of miles of experience, as well as regulatory approval, which may take longer in some jurisdictions. As these self-driving features evolve, your car will be continuously upgraded through over-the-air software updates.

So they market the capabilities as ""autopilot"". For those who don't know what the term autopilot means:

> An autopilot is a system used to control the trajectory of an aircraft, marine craft or spacecraft without requiring constant manual control by a human operator. Autopilots do not replace human operators. Instead, the autopilot assists the operator's control of the vehicle, allowing the operator to focus on broader aspects of operations (for example, monitoring the trajectory, weather and on-board systems).

This is exactly what Tesla's software does.

Your vision automatically also categorizes everything it sees (being prey for billions of years makes that extremely important). 

All of this happens without you thinking about it, with almost zero delay.

Do you guys have any recommendations of more stable etfs or funds? I’d like something less risky because I would like to use this money in the near future- I don’t want to keep it in the bank anymore due to inflation fears.

A company like Tesla can't stay at a 600 P/E, and 70 P/FCF if the sole reason holding them at such high valuation is hype around a CEO and a social sentiment for the future. See what happened to railroads stocks in the early 1900s, and the car stocks in the 1950s. 

If you think these metrics are able to be maintained, honestly, tell me how. Even Amazon, a company spending billions year over year in R&D, was considered by many (at 100-200 PE) to be overvalued as fuck even after proving they were a cash-cow with AWS, Amazon website, etc. They are even 2x as profitable as Tesla!

 I'm far from thinking that Telsa is dying. But thinking it will become a SUSTAINABLE trillion dollar+ company while:

1. Having a 3% profitability

2. Crazy priced-in valuations (because of hype and 'a sentiment for the future

3. The need to issue 5% more share PER YEAR to sustain operations AND ALSO regulatory credits (money given by the government for developping non-polluting technology 

4. Having an almost bigger market cap than the 12 largests automakers in the world that sell over 90% of the cars 

5. Not really having a monopoly in the EV sector

Tesla is not only an automaker, but without this source of revenue, the company WILL not be able to sustain its growth. So the people saying 'your point is not relevant, Tesla doesn't only make cars' are wrong.

I'm not anti-Tesla, I'm just against betting for the future when it has been proved and demonstrated than jumping on the trend, after it has already exploded, will net you lower returns over the years. You bet money last year? Nice. Betting this year? Meh, it is a bubble only waiting to explode. In the short term, I guess it could rise. 1-2 years maybe? But give it 10-20 years and I guarantee you Tesla will not be where you're expecting it to be.

I believe one tool can cost $10M-$20M and that price goes up substantially with each new iteration of chips - look up Moore's Second Law.

So you can have multiple checking accounts insured to that amount. But i hear you saying ""That seems messy! Thats 8 or 10  accounts with one or multiple banks! Is there an easier way?"". Well bud it's the first way i found out how to protect multiple millions. The other way I'm learning about and looking into,which i must admit, is wayyyyy freaking better is something called ""security backed lines of credit"". Get this: you can have x amount of dollars in the stock market to grow and be untouched (like he suggested some broad etf's ! *wink wink*) but they will give you up too 80%(this really depends on THE BANK,and other factors like how much money you put in, the market value and volatility of stock you picked, credit score(i think), and means to pay back (like if you have more money just sitting in bank account with them not being used as a line of credit).
