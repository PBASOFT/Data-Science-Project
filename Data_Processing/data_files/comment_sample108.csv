The decay totally takes care of the rest. If you look at a 1 year + chart of UVXY, it's hard to find any 4 month period where if you were get puts in at a peak or even peak-ish moment and then 4 months later there isn't at least a few days where your put would have been well ITM. now, if the VIX settles to neutral as it's asymptotic trend seems to be doing, and/or we head for a consistently down market, this strategy doesn't work.

Today when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my body finally surrenders, I weep, as my school and my city go under. I fucking hate gaming laptops.",[],1

They buy the dip, but they over buy it.  They make money until a bear market.  Then they wipe out half their gains chasing a dip that keeps dipping.  Then they get scared, go quiet in the forums and discord, and pull into cash.

It is *exactly* at this moment that you want to go long.  Early in a recovery from a correction moderately OTM leaps are best - good gains on the upside and won't slice your fingers off if the dip keeps dipping.

How could a big bet on Canadian banks possibly go wrong?  I mean, the only way it could go tits up is if a bunch of the assets they have on their books turned out to be toxic garbage.  But that's impossible.  There would have to be a massive real estate bubble or something to make that happen.

This either sounds genius, or more likely stupid/doesn't work. $900 calls would be better because if you truly think the stock is going to hit 2k-3k, then you'll make more with buying all $900 calls.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

and thats going to be a new all time high.

OP probably bought this contract back in February, its already lost almost all of its premium even though there are still almost 2 months left.

next ER is on 8/9 (as per TOS), it may gets a pop for ER run-up... but by that time theta most likely ate most of the premium.

&#x200B;

what if $SPCE moves side ways ? or not high enough ? or moving even lower... 11/25/19 low was $6.90

And no they didn't have to go through production hell and not have to build from a tent.

Right now monthly production of the mach e is from one plant and at about 6k a month. There has been 20k produced and most are still in the pipeline to the dealers. The cuautitlan plant will peak at 11k a month roughly, when the ramp completes.

The first year projected sales is 50k but when it is fully ramped you're looking at maybe 130k or so per year out of one plant. Not much but it is a good start. I really don't know if it will need to produce any faster, depending on the demand I suppose. 

I remember a time in 2017 in which not a car company was supposed to complete ramp in 2nd half, but only made 2.5k in the entire Q4. But anyways, I digress. Producing cars are difficult business, not all companies are suited for it.

What is the average utilization of a flight? Some airlines have been filling middle seats while others have kept them free. Pre-covid even, some airlines were much better optimizing their flights than others for higher utilization (e.g. Delta was king of this before the pandemic)

What routes do the airlines cover? Is it mostly cheap Inter-hub destinations with low margins? Or niche vacation spots with higher margins but lower utilization? What percent is international versus domestic, and how does the environment look for international travel? 

Also, a huge part of airlines is where they are in their aircraft cycle ‚Äî did they just upgrade and already went through the capex spend so they‚Äôre well-positioned going forward? Or do they need to buy a new fleet and are going to hemorrhage cash in the next few years?

How are they levered? AAL is over levered relative to peers, hence the discount.

What percentage of their corporate versus consumer? Which demographic is expected to bounce back more quickly post Covid? (Answer: Consumer - this is why Southwest is trading so well while United has lagged.)

> ‚Ä¶ **a grossly disproportionate fraction of the total return came from a very few ""superstocks""** like Dell Computer, which increased in value over 550 times. If you didn‚Äôt have one of the half-dozen or so of these in your portfolio, then you badly lagged the market. (The **odds of owing one of the 10 superstocks are approximately one in six.**) Of course, by owning only 15 stocks you also increase your chances of becoming fabulously rich. But unfortunately, in investing, it is all too often true that **the same things that maximize your chances of getting rich also maximize your chances of getting poor.**

> ‚Ä¶even 100 stocks are not nearly enough to eliminate this very important source of financial risk.

> So, yes, Virginia, you can eliminate nonsytematic portfolio risk, as defined by Modern Portfolio Theory, with a relatively few stocks. It‚Äôs just that nonsystematic risk is only a small part of the puzzle. Fifteen stocks is not enough. Thirty is not enough. Even 200 is not enough. **The only way to truly minimize the risks of stock ownership is by owning the whole market.**

So you end up with an industry that now costs more and has less consumers with a commoditized product. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the weaker airlines like American go bankrupt in the next 3-4 years

7849,gz9jr2f,2021-05-24,t1_gz9dzol,wallstreetbets,"This may be the case, if it is valuable someone will kill for it.. OK, if that's your view?? - but I get the impression - pretty much weekly from international news - and looking at the last few years (since the 50s?) - that a lot of world international policy, meaning (bottom line) gunships, power structurtes, alliances, weapons deals, interference in foreign governments, & deaths, .. comes down to Oil . and not much else. It's kind of a DOMINANT THEME aint it?  
I invest in rare earth metals, I dont feel good or bad about that, I just DD the international situation for interest, and for my own benefit.. and there is DEFINITELY international policy driven by different governments (in competition as governments) about who produces it, mining, processing, refining, distribution, prices, availability, recycling, recovery, control of resources ..

 BUT I don't invest in oil.. I have other stuff that can make me a profit, and oil, as an international driver of world policy causes too much direct trouble.. as we ALL know. It's just a fact, make up your own morality about it, I don't specially care. I aint got no crusade to shout about.  
Oil companies are either diversifying or they are combining to get the maximum profit out of oil exploitation as rapidly as possible before it goes tits up.   
Of course they do both right now (plenty big cash to be made) .. but to me there is a clear trend. Big oil is thinking of Today AND it is thinking Ahead.. it already has plans ten years from now and more.  It already makes investments.  
    
Personally I don't need to be involved with that commodity -  it makes a mess of international policy and peoples lives, it has IN GENERAL too much power, too much money, a crap view of human life, shits on democracy,  and in a while it will be obsolete..   so wtf.. I like my current investment to have future value too.. I dont run on the <<I make the profit so FUCK you>>  principle. Maybe that's why I'm such a crap trader ?  
(deeply sorry if I insulted any really nice oil companies there, I know you are doing your best : profit and happiness, right?)

**HEY!** \- By the way - rare earth metals are **NOT** only about batteries.. we can't run a civilization AT ALL without them. End of story  
Do your DD on rare earths supply chain and what they are for (jeez, what the fuck are they NOT used for?) .   
E.G. I would have thought EVERYBODY by now would know why the car industry is short of chips .. just to state one obvious instance.. like, no rare earths =  no telephones, no electronics, no computers, no TV .. hmm? .. and already smart folk (and smart governments) are extending the definition of rare earths from the scientific group, out  to include aluminum and copper.. 

But still.. when was the last time a US president had a high level meeting on international alliances and arms deals to guarantee lithium supplies?

Their energy products, solar panels and utilities are actually sold at a loss. They sell them at a loss because it makes their main product, the car, a more attractive purchase.

They don't actually fully manufacture solar panels by the way, they simply assemble them. They ""make solar panels"" the same way gamers ""make a computer"". They're more of a solar panel reseller than manufacturer.

As for batteries, they're still very reliant on upstream suppliers. And they're not the only people in the world working on battery tech. It looks like they have an edge due to the range on their cars compared with competitors, but that's actually an issue of price-to-utility ratio, competitors aren't selling longer-range cars because consumers don't seem to care much about range past the 200km mark.

The problem you are stumbling on is called a liquidity trap. Banks will not lend out money to the poors if there is not a good use for it. If there is a sound use for the money the bank can ensure they get repaid.

Ask yourself: why are there no good uses for money in our economy??? Maybe something to do with the fact that building a bridge used to cost $50,000,000 but today just the environmental impact study costs $200,000,000 and 5 years to complete. 

Regulations and government intervention have strangled our economy to death since 2008 and therefore millennials have been doing very bad.
