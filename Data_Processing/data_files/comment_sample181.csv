Maybe I'm grounded in science too much, but there is no way to answer this question as written. I would need answers to a dozen questions before even starting to assess what they number might be. 

If you don't know what number is a life changing amount of money for YOU, and you can't pair that up with a price target and do some division...you're probably in the exact right place to be getting financial advice. 

What country to you live in? What part of the country? How much is cost of living there? How old are you? Do you have debt? How much debt? Do you have any expensive medical conditions? Do you have children? How many and will they be going to college? Are YOU wanting to go to college? How much is college in what ever country you live in? Do you want to travel the rest of your life or are you happy living comfortably in a modest home for the rest of your life...how ever long that might be? 

Life changing money might be $5,000 for one person who is 21 and just needs enough to pay for the last 2 quarters of college and finish a degree (potentially changing their life) while they live at home, or it might be 5 million for someone else who is 40 or 50, owns and runs multiple businesses, and just wants to shut it all down and walk away but not lower their quality of life. Or maybe it's 10 million for someone who works making 200k a year, but they are trapped in a job with great health coverage and their little girl has an illness that is covered by their health insurance, but it would cost 100,000 a year in medical if they quit their job.",[],0

If you truly believe the stock is going to rip tomorrow, your choices are:

1) buy one share, profit $50 if the stock hits $300 tomorrow
2) buy one call option, profit $30-ish x 100 if the stock hits $300 tomorrow (this is an estimate, theta and IV are fucking wild y'all).

&#x200B;

When you purchase a stock, the stock must be delivered T+2 (T is trading day). 

With the huge run up, the DTCC asked these broke guys (broke as in they're rich but they ain't fuck you level wealthy) to pony up more money because it ain't looking too good for them.  Then the brokers and the boy from Bulgaria halted retail from buying.  Once the buy pressure was off, the VAR requirements should have went down.

BUT, the problem is that the collateral requirements were waived.  RH probably didn't want to be in a position where they publicly announce they have a liquidity issue before going IPO.  So they did what any good politician or crook does.  Thank you for your question, it is a very important one.  We here at robbin da hood do a great job of stealing from the public and them agreeing with it.  We have to protect them from their own stupidity.

842,gzq3v5i,2021-05-28,t3_nmofz4,wallstreetbets,"I don't know the details with Alex Karp, but for those trying to understand the tax treatment here, what the author is saying is he received nonstatutory stock options.

Tax-wise, when the option is exercised (i.e. he buys the shares) he has regular ordinary income on the difference between the current share price and the strike price. For example if the strike is $10 and the stock price is $22 he has income on 22-10=12.

Two things to keep in mind... One, he has to come up with the $10 per share, which he can simply get via selling enough shares to cover the $10 cost and two, he needs enough money to pay tax on the $12 income, which may force him to sell another large chunk of those shares.

If his plan is to hold the shares, then to the extent he does not need funds to cover the strike price it is beneficial for him for the share price to be lower as his tax burden is less. BUT, as he needs money to cover that strike, obviously a higher price might be better.

Going back to my example above, if he exercised 100 shares worth, he would need $1,000 to cover the strike, which at $22 per share would be about 45 shares. In addition to cover taxes (assuming 40% x $1,200 = $480) he would need to sell another 22 shares, leaving him with 33 shares net. If the share price instead was $15, then he would need to sell 67 shares to cover the strike and the tax (40% x $500 = $200) would need another 13 shares, netting him with 20 shares. Bottom line, he benefits from the stock price being up if he needs to cover the strike price.

This is all forced activity as the alternative may be to lose the money.

Not sure how my explanation plays into your thesis but it is what it is.

I am bullish on PLTR.",['PLTR'],0

Monthlies and LEAPs have a place (like right now when IV ridiculous) but usually it's good write them 1 week out and just collect a little bit many many times, every other week.

Might make more sense to write an ATM covered call, and then write a put at a price you'd actually want to buy 100 more shares at, and hope the price closes right under the call, so you collect premium on both ends.  Most of my positions with shares have weekly covered calls, monthly short/cash secure puts, and a single LEAP (the CCs and CSPs pay for the LEAP basically)

There's a lot of latent selling pressure if the price doesn't continue to rise, which would likely lead to a deflation tomorrow.

2766,gzq82az,2021-05-28,t1_gx15evz,wallstreetbets,"As a physics major who has built their own systems (as in soldered together the cells by hand and forward) and taken measurements for years from these systems in the rainy Seattle area...you're just wrong. 

Without going all out crazy on actually building the parts, I can build and install on off grid system buying the equipment at retail prices and without subsidies and build a system that generates enough power to pay for itself in 7 years...in Seattle. We get an average of 2.9 full hours of sun per day as our 365 day average. Arizona gets almost double that.

I could write a 3 page rebuttal, math out all the physics, give you price quotes on all the equipment, estimate labor hours involved using numbers from installations already built and prove that it's viable. I could also discuss how properly installing wind across the country (the wind might not always be blowing where YOU are, but it's always blowing SOMEWHERE) would serve to meet a base load demand that would drastically reduce the need for battery storage. And I could spend hours going fully in depth on the topic, but it wouldn't change your mind. Nothing will. 

But I'll give you 1 example:
A 100 watt solar panel, if bought in bulk, can cost around $50 dollars. Without incentives.

A 100 watt panel installed in AZ will average about 0.6kwh a day of production. 

That's 219kwh a year. Average cost of electricity nationwide is around 15c per kwh last I checked.

That's a value of about $330 per decade. 

I have a 2000 watt inverter from Energizer that I bought years ago for less than $200. It can comfortably handle 15 panels, so pro rate that out to an additional $13 per 100 watts. This is an off the shelf retail priced unit. 

One of my first charge controllers was a $15 off the shelf that can handle 300 watts. So add another $5 per panel. 

If it's grid tie we don't need a battery. So we are sitting at about $70 pet 100 watts installed with off the shelf retail priced gear that will produce about $900 worth of electricity over a 30 year service life. Some degradation will occure, so I knocked off about 10%. We are finding that many are still producing at 85% of original capacity at the 30 year mark.

So tell me where we find another +$800 of costs to make this economically non viable. And consider what happens to the costs involved when we start pricing things at wholesale prices and start using utility scale inverters, charge controllers etc. And what happens to the cost when the country goes all in on this and does utility scale installs on nice flat ground in the desert instead of the premium we pay for doing it on a roof.

There are already utility scale installs done in other counties that came in at a net, unsubsidized cost of just over $1 per watt. And the tech just keeps getting better. We've seen power outputs from PV continue to go up while manufacturing costs keep coming down. 

At $1 a watt (fully installed) the above example comes in at $100 for our $900 worth of power. In Seattle area we land at around $450 worth of power for $100 and less than a 7 year time line to pay for itself.. 

We'll be at 50c a watt fully installed within 10 to 15 years. 
You either have incomplete information, bad information, or an unreasonable bias against solar. It's just flat cheaper than anything but wind when done correctly. And if paired correctly with wind it could save our country 10s of billions of dollars per year and give us a huge economic advantage over the rest of the world....if we get there first..

The small system I built for myself, pro rated out over 30 years, currently powers my Volt at a cost of less than a penny a mile. Batteries can hold twice as much power per KG as they could just 10 or 20 years ago and that tech is still quickly improving also. Once we have enough of them built, the recycling industry will be a huge job sector reclaiming car batteries. 

In residential transportation alone...say we have 100 million daily drivers averaging 1000 miles a month in 30mpg cars at $3 a gallon. That's 10c mile. We could be saving 9c a mile. $90 a month x 100m drivers = $9 billion a month. Those lower costs can be used to entice foreign businesses to come do manufacturing here. If they do their work at peak power production we could even offer them free power.

Solar and wind are hear to stay. They will generate more jobs, provide cheaper power, and be less of an economic and security risk than oil. and give us a huge manufacturing advantage..

Know what happens to the price of sunshine or wind when Russia and Saudi Arabia get into a pissing match over the price of oil? Not a damn thing.",[],0

RSI is solidly ‚Äúoverbought‚Äù if you‚Äôre into RSI words. 

Climbing RSI and crossing moving averages are more of a mathematical ‚Äúno shit‚Äù than an indication of anything after the price makes a massive spike like this after a massive dip. They‚Äôre not telling you anything that the price isn‚Äôt.

I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs equally likely that the momentum stalls out now that the price is back at its pre-dip level. Anyone with half a brain that bought below 110 is about to sell for a nice profit. Everyone who buys their shares is going to be watching this crawl for the next few months.

From a valuation standpoint, you‚Äôve had a good year but does it deserve to be a $126bil company? Tripling in a year and a half is ambitious. I would stay diversified with your options. From a fundamentals standpoint, I grew up hearing from my dad (a classic engineer/CEO) about GE‚Äôs business leadership and pedigree, but years of disappointment in their leadership and focus slowly soiled my dad‚Äôs lofty opinions of GE in my mind. I always had those same great expectations that my dad had and that you have of what GE could do with energy and aerospace and it‚Äôs only been steady over time. Sure there has been and is potential but how mired is it in the remaining legacy businesses and debt. I‚Äôve been hearing the same implicit and explicit promises from GE for literally decades. I don‚Äôt think GE is terrible but I do think there are too many other opportunities or companies with better product and personnel leadership. Every dollar invested has an opportunity cost. And I think every dollar invested should be treated as if the invested company has pitched you for that dollar that they‚Äôd put it to work better than anyone else. Is GE still cleaning up their dirty diapers or are they grown ups again. I don‚Äôt know. If Larry Culp and Elon Musk sat with you for an hour asking you to invest in them and their companies, would you really pick Culp over Musk? Okay, so I‚Äôm a Tesla fanboy but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs coincidence that the top employer that engineers want to work at is Tesla. There are other good companies too, it‚Äôs not all about Tesla, I‚Äôm just wondering if GE is in the upper echelon of companies and opportunities. And will money managers look past GE‚Äôs rough recent past? They really want GE in their top 10 holdings list? Sure you can date the hot chick turned hooker that you‚Äôve tamed and cleaned up but at the end of the day do you want to introduce her to your parents? Anyway, your DD was indeed diligent though and I hope your calls pan out. I should also say that I have not stayed current with research or news on GE since I lost interest in them, so be aware I am not current on this, and I can be entirely wrong.",['GE'],0

Squeeze happens when everything goes wrong and the stock price careens wildly out of control forcing them to buy back the share at a significantly higher price than what they had borrowed it at, this also puts money into the stock and exacerbates the price movement upwards.

Say a stock is shorted by a hedgefund f. ex.
Said hedgefund has borrowed a number of shares and sold them earlier, with the intention to buy back these shares, when the share price is lower than at the time of borrowing. Therefore the hedgefund can keep the difference for themselves.
They pay interest to borrow shares, which means they don't want to keep these shares for too long.

If a price of a stock goes up alot, it creates the incentive for the borrower to cover his positions as quickly as possible, to avoid even higher buy in prices.
This in turn increases demand, share prices rise even further. The opposite of what the borrower wants.

Yes IV is wild right now. But why the fuck would I straddle a short and long half and half? 

And if I'm not hedging my whole position what's the point? 

Buying 300 shares and 3 puts expiring soon is much cheaper then loading up on 300 shorts that will just break you even cause you straddled both sides and hoping it swings in your favor to get out on both positions green.

The goal is to hedge with a small amount not match what your long position is.

If I am bullish on something why would I spend the same amount on just insurance to enter my long position?

**AMC Entertainment stock rocketed more than 50% higher on Thursday before paring gains a bit. But this time around, fellow meme stock GameStop wasn‚Äôt along for the ride.**  
  
**AMC shares (ticker: AMC) closed up 36% to $26.52, its highest close since May 12, 2017, according to Dow Jones Market Data. GameStop stock (GME) was up 4.9%, to $254.13. The performance gap likely isn‚Äôt due to differing views about the companies‚Äô business prospects, but rather supply-and-demand quirks that are exaggerated by short interest, social-media excitement, and momentum-based trading activity.**  
  
**Shares of GameStop and AMC‚Äîboth hugely popular among retail investors on Reddit and highly shorted by some Wall Street funds‚Äîhave seen a resurgence together in recent weeks. Options activity has also picked up for both, according to Susquehanna analyst Christopher Jacobson.**

Lots of great DD on Nvax stovktwits. Probably one of the best boards for DD content. Check out AY888 on stock twits. He made a chart of the DD which shows all the future contracts that are in place along with a contract to revenue to market cap to share price conversion. Prophets at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent of Moderna market cap which will put share price at $800 to $1000. I also ha e a position of 1000 shares. Not selling for years as protein vaccines are the most efficient and handling variants so as time goes on and variance get worse and other vaccines get more ineffective protein vaccines will be the most in demand. So far and back is the only protein vaccine, it's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines so other protein competitors will be far behind and they will have an a moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing they teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now second phase at 77% efficacy. Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine. It will be combining flu and covid vaccine by 2025. They are pretty much de-risked at this point so yes you could buy cheap bios but this is one you could put a lot of money in and set it and forget it.

What you have now is a market where the leading players have consolidated market share over the past 4-5 years by operating on tight margins, but they've squeezed the other players by the balls, and now they're ready to become big time energy titans. 

Also, CSIQ kicks the rest of the industry's ass in cash flow management, they're first moving on storage + solar at utility scale, and they've found a genius way of financing the huge power plants they sell (by establishing publicly traded infrastructure investment funds - kind of like a solar REIT - in Japan, Brazil, and soon Italy). 

Although a growth stock in an already booming sector that is poised for continued exponential growth, it's priced like a granny stock that's going nowhere.

As I said this is E-Toro data, I honestly find it weird that they re able to know the total number of shareholders and we can't know for sure but if it s true 80 millions shareholders on a 70M float without including all institutions and whales, sounds like an awfull lot of shares exceeding the float. 

Anyway I guess we ll know what the fuck is going on during the shareholders meeting but this is just another source pointing toward an epic fuckery regarding the number of shares currently available on the market.",['GME'],0

It's not back on the PS store, it's still available on the Xbox.  


>‚Ä¢ the game is still full of bugs, 5 patches later and it‚Äôs still a buggy mess

The game is still full of buggs on the base xbox and PS games, i play the PC version and it's wonderfull. I personally do not believe the game will run like it should on these versions. The next catalyst for the stock will be the Next gen release later this year.  


>‚Ä¢ Promoted features that don't even exist in the game, straight up lying to customers faces. Demo gameplay rigged with features that don't even exist in the final game

Which gaming studio is not hyping their game before the release? 

&#x200B;

>‚Ä¢ DLC not even announced

Fair point

&#x200B;

>‚Ä¢ the game only sold because of the hype, go to Steam and check the numbers, nobody plays Cyberpunk anymore

They sold 13M copies (with 1 million refunds), which is huge in the gaming business. This is an extraordinary number. The Witcher 3 sold for 30M copies, which is also extraordinary.

&#x200B;

>‚Ä¢ top dogs at CDPR rewarding themselves with 5 mil $ bonuses while employees work their asses off 15 hours a day + overtime

Bobby Kotick receives hundreds of millions of compensation while firing hundreds of developers. I don't see the issue here with a 10% bonus payout to management.

&#x200B;

>‚Ä¢ worst management ever putting all the resources in marketing instead of R&D, forcing developers to release unfinished garbage

That is not true, 50% of budget went to R&D and 50% went to marketing.  
Do better research

&#x200B;

>‚Ä¢ top employees who made Witcher great left the company

great point, there is developer turnover after the release of the Witcher 3, which can be a significant risk.

&#x200B;

>‚Ä¢ lawsuites from stakeholders or did you forgot about those ?

I don't see any significant impact from these lawsuits.

&#x200B;

At the current valuation below $5B USD, i am very bullish on CDPR with the current risk-reward. The Next-gen release of the Witcher 3 will do great later this year and we need to see if Cyberpunk 2077 will be succcessfull on the PS5 / Xbox Series X.

To protect a chunk of those gains, you can set various parameters. The easiest one to understand that will protect the most gain is the trailing stop loss. What is does is set a limit you are willing to lose until, but the trailing part is important. It keeps increasing as the stock goes up. 

If you set it to 20% (there is an option for dollar amounts but I find it easier to pick a percentage) it won't just sit at a 20% loss at $20 if it goes up to $30. Your limit will now automatically move to a 20% loss of $30, capturing all the gains you made up to that point. That's why it's a trailing number, since it follows the stock up.

Now if it shits the bed and goes down to $8, your 20% limit let you get out at $16, protecting some of your gains. 

The biggest choice you have to make is what profit you're comfortable losing, and what you stop loss is set at. Too high, like 10% on a fluctuating stock, and you screw yourself out of gains if it just touches it and rebounds up 12% unless you are on top of it.
