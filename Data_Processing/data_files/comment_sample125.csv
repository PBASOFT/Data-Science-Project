0,gzow37w,2021-05-27,t3_nm38t1,investing,"Hi, I'm 31 and living in Canada.

I'm looking for resources that explain how to get started with options. I'm not new to markets (currently have money in TD, Bank of Nova Scotia, Enbridge, Shaw Communications, and Great West Life that's just paying out and reinvestmenting dividends).

I have a small pool of $2000 in an account I forgot about and I'd like to experiment with options with it. Not looking to make tons of money but maybe a couple hundred here and there.  I just don't know where to begin with options so wondering is someone would be able to point me in the right direction of some resources that really dumb it down.

Thanks!",[],0

There have been people who successfully researched horse racing and consistently made insanely high returns. And they were not gambling. If you are playing to move the expected return to positive, you are not gambling anymore. It's only gambling if you are expected to lose money over time.

Just because there is a probability that an investment will lose money doesn't mean you are gambling.

If you follow your logic, bonds are also gambling. A company may reveal tomorrow that its earnings are completely fraudulent and it has no cash to pay back on its bonds.

Leveraged ETFs aren't ""gambling"" or ""evil."" Leverage simply isn't suitable for highly volatile investments. Leverage shouldn't be kept constant through investment, when returns are cyclical and follow momentum. If there is such a thing as a bull market and bear market, you would want to leverage up in a bull market and leverage down in a bear market.

Also the reason P/E ratios are so high is because earnings were severely depressed last year due to the COVID-19 shutdown. You need to consider that GDP and profits are growing at an abnormally high rate. Also interest rates are at historic lows which puts upward pressure on stock prices.

This doesn't mean stocks are undervalued, but that there is additional context for you to consider apart from one metric, P/E ratio.

**GDP: +6.5% Q/Q annual rate**

**Corporate profits: +25.2% year over year**

They have no technical indicators on mobile, and only offer RSI MACD and I believe EMA on the desktop portfolio.  They have very little helpful trading guides, no forex and, compared to TDA, are laughably devoid of features.  

The biggest problem though is they have very clear operational problems and haven't scaled up well to meet their current size.  Putting gamestop aside, they also had severe issues handling crypto volatility and have regular maintenance outages.  If you ever have a problem, their customer service is laughably bad and you will never get help.  

I use robinhood sometimes for the very clean and easy to read options chain.  However, I would never put my money into it again and am very happy using TDA.

ThinkorSwim is overbuilt to hell and, while eyeball sandpaper to look at, is very well equipped for anything you'd need or want.  TDA is gigantic and will probably not run into the same liquidity issues that robinhood does when it comes to unprecedented market volatility, they also have hundreds of legitimately helpful guides and videos on trading strategies among many other things.

If you think of stocks as businesses it becomes a lot more straight forward. You would invest in a business if you see the cost of ownership worth your share of all their expected future earnings based on some analysis.

 If the business performs as expected but the stock price goes up a lot the stock may become overvalued. If the capital tied up in the overvalued stock could be better allocated into a different business at a better price, you may want to consider selling.

If a business fails to perform how you expected and you realize they will not live up to your earnings expectations, then it may be a good reason to sell. Then you should re-examine where in your analysis you made a mistake and try to avoid that in the future.

In my opinion, you should never buy or sell simply based on stock price movements ALONE but take into account how the company is actually performing.",[],0

$PTON had $1.82B of revenue in 2020. It currently trades at a market cap of roughly 33B.  
$FRX / $BODY is on track for $1.1B in revenue this year and is being valued at roughly 3B after the merger is completed.... I think we have some upside here...   
$PTON's trailing 12 months revenue is currently at 3.692B. $FRX / $BODY is on track to hit 1.1B this year. That’s plenty of upside for the short term. Long term $FRX / $BODY is projected to  
hit 3.3B by 2025. With the integration of all parts of their business (Bikes,Supplements, Connected Fitness Subscriptions Services, OpenFit App, BODi, etc.) the value for each new customer acquired goes up.

224,gzpbnws,2021-05-28,t3_nmdtyc,investing,"I am a former professional card counter and blackjack player.

Everything is exponential, and therefore has exponential risk. In BlackJack, the likelyhood you will be up a measly 1% is like 93% of the time but each second you stay in, means you are likely to go the other way and lose. The likelyhood you will double your money is like 2% of the time, and the risk is so high because it almost never happens and when you DO double your money, you keep playing anyways til you lose. 

So the longer you are positive, the more likely you are to lose at blackjack with each passing second based on the odds. 

So how does this apply to stocks? 

Well, establish if you can lose the money, and how risky the play is. Right now, I 'got lucky' and doubled my money in AMC by accident. I should sell now, because let's face it, doubling any money in 36 hours is a 1/1000 chance of happening. On the other hand, I am in a positive bull run. I have $2500 sunk into it, for a $5000 total investment as of today. I did my homework and I believe ( I may be wrong) but I believe it will close in the green tomorrow EOD and also on Tuesday EOD and probably get wiped out Wednesday of next week. So, on one hand, I am absolutely stupid for not selling at a 100% win. On the other, I am risking $2500 which I _could_ afford to lose in a very risky bet to let it ride til Tuesday. 

Now, if you are day trading or week trading, there is something called a win goal. You set up your position with a win amount. If you are new, go for small wins, like 3-5% and see if you can do it. See if you can plop down $1k and see if you make 5% back. If you can consistently do this, great. Maybe increase your win goal then to 10% and see if over time you seem to 'get lucky' and average out to a 10% win goal. It's still gambling with this day and week trading but it's 'informed, educated' gambling. 

The third option is to just buy something and leave it there for 5 years long term. DAL, CCL, or those other transportation ones are like that, as well as AAPL. You just leave them forever.

It's also fairly easy to create a basket of diversified stocks on your own these days. So please educate yourself before saying any more stupid things. 

Secondly, VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market) is at a negligible .03%. What both of you and some of your hypothetical studies don't realize is how sizable that difference is (especially as ETF costs have approached 0 over time) due to compounding. If you don't count fees (and to a lesser extent, tracking error) you are missing a huge part of the equation. 

Over 50 years, any alpha you have gets severely eroded. $1 invested at .03% fees depreciates by 1.5% (1 - .9997\^50). At 1% fees, you would lose **40% (1 - .99\^50)**.  

Look at all the charts you linked and start taking the fees and error into account, and you'll see most of the excess returns evaporate.

341,gzpkrpy,2021-05-28,t3_nm50u3,investing,"If you just brought leveraged ETFs like TQQQ. Then that is another story. In order to know whether we should hold it forever, let’s do some calculations. We will use the TQQQ as an example to demonstrate the point.

According to ProShares (the founder of TQQQ), ProShares UltraPro QQQ seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to three times (3x) the daily performance of the Nasdaq Index.

In other words, if Nasdaq rises 1%, TQQQ would also rise 3% because that is three times the performance of the Nasdaq and vice-versa.

Here is the fun part. For the sake of simplicity, let’s assume Nasdaq is at 10,000 points, and you got 100 shares of TQQQ at $100, which would be $10,000 ($100 x 100 shares). Nasdaq rises 10% today and drop 9% tomorrow. So, the Nasdaq index would become 10,010 points (10,000 x 110% x 91%). It would result in 10 points rise. On the other hand, TQQQ will follow the Nasdaq but three time the performance. It would be rising 30% today and drop 27% tomorrow. Therefore, TQQQ price would be $9490 (10,000 x 130% x 0.73%). You are losing money even Nasdaq has 10 points increased. That is called decay. To put it simply, the bigger the single-day volatility, the bigger drop or rise you would experience.

However, we must realize that even though it is mathematically correct, it doesn’t mean it is applicable to all circumstances, which means it might not work like that in real life.

Decay Is Real And Fake At The Same Time

If people are into academics very much, they tend to forget that life is not as perfect as the mathematical formula. Stock markets usually have few ways to perform.
1.	Drop > Rise
2.	Rise > Drop
3.	Rise > Rise More
4.	Drop > Drop More

However, people tend to and love to just talk about situations 1 and 2, which is “drop then rise” and “rise then drop”. They forget about the existence of the other two. In fact, 3 and 4 would very likely happen because the probability is 25% for the four options.

Situation 3 – Rise > Rise More

If the Nasdaq rise 10% today and tomorrow, then it would be 12,100 points (10,000 x 110% x 110%). For the TQQQ, it would be $16900 ($10,000 x 130% x 130%). That is winning by almost 40% more rise than Nasdaq itself.

Situation 4 – Drop > Drop More

If the Nasdaq drop 10% today and tomorrow, then it would be 8,100 points (10,000 x 90% x 90%). For the TQQQ, it would be $5,329 ($10,000 x 73% x 73%). That is losing more than half of Nasdaq itself.

It looks really scary because if you remember the chart from the beginning, if you lose 50%, then you need to gain back 100% to break even. However, we can now notice one very obvious thing, if leveraged products keep rising or dropping, it would have a tremendous result in the price. In other words, it would be more than what the leveraged product promised. But again, that’s just simply based on mathematical calculations, it is not necessarily true in the real world because the place we both live in is far from perfect.

It is nearly impossible for Nasdaq to rise 10% each day for a month or drop 10% each day for a month because Nasdaq or any other index is just too big to fail. You can’t even find one single week in the whole stock market history to drop 10% each day without rebounding or rise 10% each day without adjustment. Therefore, as long as you are not borrowing money to play this game and you decided to hold it until the end, you would be fine.",[],0

That would be throwing away money.

In-the-money call options are comprised of extrinsic and intrinsic value. (Out-of-the-money options are purely extrinsic value.) The intrinsic value of an option is equal to the stock's price minus the option's strike price; e.g., for $12.15 XYZ price, a $12C would have $0.15 of intrinsic value in its premium. The extrinsic value is everything else in the contract's premium. Using the past example, if the call's premium was $1.00, then $0.85 would be extrinsic value to account for the time to expiration and implied volatility of the contract.

So, exercising a call option that still has extrinsic value results in a loss of that extrinsic value. Again using the same example, if you were to exercise that $12C, then you would lose $85. If you instead sold the contract and purchased 100 shares at $12.15, then you would capture that $85 in extrinsic value.

Don't exercise options unless you absolutely know it will be more profitable.",[],0

1) It's really not simplistic to have a ""vested interest"" against leveraged ETFs mate as it is for individual equities mate; I don't hold any bull or bearish positions - stop being lazy with these veiled accusations and support your statements with facts

2) Nobody was ignored. The comment was read and addressed.  I agree with everything stated in the link, or rather, everything in the link supported what I said to begin with  

3) Saying that it is a ""weak point"" to weigh the fees aka cost of leveraging a financial instrument against the benefit of using a financial instrument is one of the most moronic things I've ever heard 

4) Your link neither includes a back-test of leveraged ETFs, nor leveraged ETFs mentioned at all. In fact, I would also agree given today's interest rate environment that using margin is indeed a good strategy 

5) Despite what you say about it being simplistic to find back-tested strategies, every test that shows significant benefits of leveraged ETFs fails to include fees and tracking error. The better case studies (including the one linked prior) all reach the conclusion that the benefits of these ETFs all hinge on fees (which haven't come down) and back-test period. 

6) If leverage is the goal, there are several ways to achieve it, and any leveraged ETF strategy should be comped against those methodologies as well (such as allocating % of your portfolio to LEAPs, margin less interest expense, et.c)",[],0

Short term rates clearly go down in response to negative shocks, and so do stocks. What to make of it? A few thoughts:

* Which end of the curve? Probably short-term rates swing faster in downturns, and stocks are typically benchmarked against longer-term rates.

* Can negative shocks be expected to keep happening? (Never mind the question of ""Can rates keep going down?"" -- IMO the question of the age.)

1) The article plain states that leveraged strategies have lower risk-adjusted returns and negative alpha. 

""There is no free lunch here, though, as the annualized volatility is multiples of the unlevered index, leading to inferior risk-adjusted performance and larger drawdowns""

Further, slide 16/17 DOES NOT refer to a simulation of a leveraged ETF. The calculations here are a proxy of using margin to create leverage - **leverage using margin does not create the same tracking error nor drag that ETFs do**. The issue with margin is that fees here are typically larger than 1%, though historically low margin rates have made it close for a select few brokers. 

2) This article does a more effective back-test (although it still omits tracking error) arrives at the following conclusion - ""Unfortunately there may be a reason not to hold leveraged ETFs for the long term but it has nothing to do with volatility drag. It is because of fees....the return of the leverage = 2 ETF has been reduced to that of a fee-free leverage = 1 ETF. So all the benefits of leveraging have been lost."" 

Equivalent/lower returns at increased risked and higher draw downs equates INFERIOR performance. And yes, there are both 0 fee ETFs (SFY) or negligible fee ETFs like VTI.

3) Don't forget that some of these back-tests don't track dividend error or total return challenges that some leveraged ETFs face.",[],0

This isn't a broad market index. 

It's a sector specific index. 


>So here are some questions I now have:

>1. Is this dramatic skewedness toward just one or two companies unusual in an ETF?

Depends on the sector.

- How much of the American oil/gasoline secure is Exxon/mobile? 

Probably a lot, there's that many refinery gasoline companies.

- How much of the telecommunication sector is AT&T?

At one time they were practically a monopoly.

- How much of the shipping sector is FedEx?
- How much of the entertainment is Disney?

>2. Does anyone care to explain why such a skewness is justified in this case?

Sector funds for sectors dominated by a few companies are going to be not diverse. And the technology sector is dominated by five companies, who barely compete against each other.


>3. What are some technology ETFs that better balances the exposure to each company in the fund, but also have near-zero expense ratios?

One thing I find really interesting reading Reddit is how everyone seems just buy a big pile of stock and then sell it in a big pile.  I don't do that.  I build a position as the company's prospects wax and wane.   If I have a large position, I exit it in the same way.  I started buying NKE in 2010 with 10 shares.  Now I have a couple hundred.  I haven't bought in a while though.  I've never sold a share of NKE but I'm starting to think about it.  

I hear alot about ""rebalancing"" for sector or market exposure.  I don't ever do that.  I ""rebalance"" to increase my exposure to companies with improving prospects, and decrease my exposure to companies with declining prospects.  NKE is still a good company, but it owns pretty much every sports brand that ever existed.  What's it going to do for it's next act?  So that's why I'm thinking about reducing NKE.  OTOH, DKNG looks like a great opportunity in sports.  So I might want to increase my exposure there.",[],1

Thats simply not the case. The best way I can describe it in one line is that Snowflake is a DBA-as-a-Service for data warehousing

Not actually DBAs, but their ODBC connectors and drivers can pair to virtually anything. From 1,000,000,000 row DBASE tables last updated in 1996, SQL, etc. Then links and allows data to be shared, replicated in near real-time, queried, and joined across all of them transparently. Theres not a need for creating the perfect indexes and connectors to get at the data quickly, and you don't have the issues where you wish you could just join two tables in two completely different database systems.


Overall I think they might still be a bit overvalued. But in my opinion they have a much better product than anything else currently out there. I don't really see any direct competition from the big three coming anytime soon, and companies like oracle and IBM are literally still going in the opposite direction, so they don't need to compete on cost but they are in order to get faster adoption.

The price will go up once they get to the adoption level they want, and customers will begrudgingly pay for it. Until then, I'm holding the shares I have. Once I start hearing about them increasing their prices, I'll start buying.",[],0

687,gzqmyk6,2021-05-28,t3_nmtkg5,investing,"This is a 2 parter. Not sure if this is the right place for this, but here goes:

**First**

I made a RobinHood account to buy some of the stocks that WSB had been supporting (GME, AMC, BB, NOK, BBBY). I put my orders in and, as many others experienced, they cancelled the orders with their bs excuses to protect the short hedge funds.

I have filed a complaint with the SEC, but I'm curious - to what degree is there any sort of fiduciary responsibility to those that put legitimate orders in and as result, potentially lost money?

**Second**

When I made the account they gave me a single share of stock, their ""gift."" After the debacle, the very next day I went to close the account but I couldn't b/c I still had an open position. I opened a Fidelity account, and decided to have them request the share be transferred over. I'm very new to this, so I had no idea there was a $75 transfer fee. If I had, I would have just sold the stock outright. Why would anyone transfer a single share valued at ~$4 for $75?

Now I feel that RH *should* have emailed/messaged me via the app something to the effect of: ""We received your transfer request. There is a $75 fee, or you have X amount of time to cancel the transfer, after which, you are responsible for it."" Or words to that effect. Certainly, they have the time to spam me everyday - and still do!! But nope. They just wanted to steal some more, so not a peep.

Is there any legal or other recourse I can take to have the fee waived, reverse/cancel the transfer etc.?

717,gzqsnqs,2021-05-28,t1_gzohwpi,investing,"ETF (Exchange Traded Fund):

You buy into a fund that replicates a certain Index. Which means, you buy the actual stocks of the companies as represented in the index your fund uses. My favorite equity fund, VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) uses the FTSE Global All Cap Index, which includes over 9000 companies, representing around 98% of the worlds market cap. Since Apple represents 2.8% of the value of all stocks, Vanguard buys 2.8% of Apple for this fund. This is also called a market cap weighted or market neutral fund, which is the standard and lowest cost approach.

LETF (Leveraged Exchange Traded Fund):

They too replicate an index, but ""amplify"" that indexes returns (in the negative too), by a certain amount like 2x, 3x etc. The traditional way to get leverage would be to borrow money to buy more stocks than you have cash, also called Margin. So to have 2x leverage, you need to borrow as much as you have cash. Margin has the problem that you can be margin-called, this happens when the value of your portfolio drops too low to cover the loan. So you'd have to sell stocks at the worst time to cover the difference, this can often times lead to completely wiping out the value of your portfolio, even to the point where you lost more money than you invested.

LETF's have the advantage that you can't be margin-called. Instead of buying actual stocks and borrowing money to buy double, they buy future contracts and swaps at banks, that promise to pay the returns with a factor of 2 or 3 for example. This obviously leads to relatively high cost. Especially during highly volatile markets. Due to their nature, they can only replicate precise 2x or 3x exposure if you buy and sell them daily. There is a lot of discussion that this ""time decay"" effect might not be so relevant in certain scenarios and could be viable long term. They also introduce ""counter-party risk"", since you have to trust that the banks who sold those contracts to your fund don't go bankrupt.",['AAPL'],0

Stock futures are higher this morning, with the Dow leading the way, up 0.5% S&P and Nasdaq are up 0.4%. That’s as of 0630. This follows a day of gains for the Dow and S&P, while the Nasdaq was flat. The Russell 2000 rallied 1% yesterday.

Those gains don’t tell the whole story however, as this week has seen a marked reversal in risk appetite. The Nasdaq is up 2% for the week, with the S&P up about 1%. Companies like Boeing, Ford, Roblox, AMC, and GameStop have seen dramatic rallies.

We have a couple of economic reports today that could shed more light on consumer spending and inflation. The Personal Income and consumer spending reports and PCE Core Price Index, the Fed’s preferred gauge for inflation, are out at 0830. Expectations on the PCE are for a 2.9% year-over-year print for April.

We also have Chicago PMIs out at 0945. Last month saw a record (I think) 72.1 reading. Expectations for this month are for 68. Obviously both of these readings are well above the 50 level separating expansion from contraction.

736,gzqvzax,2021-05-28,t3_nmtl1k,investing,"Meme stocks strategyMay 28, 2021
I got into AMC yesterday on the break above the highs from a couple months ago. I’m doing the same with a few other meme and high short-interest stocks which could see rapid gains in a short amount of time on the hype. I already made quick gains on JMIA, SPCE, and BYND. My strategy is always to have a stop loss I’m OK with, take partial profits on any jump up, and constantly raise stops as price appreciates. I also keep my position size small compared to my total portfolio. 

As a part of the general market I think the moves back to meme stocks is because people are frustrated where stocks are still bottoming and consolidating. The crypto correction has sent traders looking for wild gains elsewhere. This is causing rushes into smaller names wherever momentum starts to pick up and it means the moves could be short-lived. 

Markets get more and more wild as a top happens. Then it seems like just another dip when a decline has really begun. At this stage of the bull market while I’m being aggressive when the moment is right I will prioritize safety and honor my stops if things don’t go as I hope. 

Have a set strategy in any stock you buy.","['SPCE', 'AMC']",0

$PTON had $1.82B of revenue in 2020. It currently trades at a market cap of roughly 33B. $FRX / $BODY is on track for $1.1B in revenue this year and is being valued at roughly 3B after the merger is completed.... I think we have some upside here...  
Peloton’s trailing 12 months revenue is currently at 3.692B. Again $FRX soon to be $BODY is on track to hit 1.1B this year. That’s plenty of upside for the short term.   
Long term they are projected to hit 3.3B by 2025.With the integration of all parts of their business (Bikes, Supplements, Connected Fitness Subscriptions Services, OpenFit App, BODi, etc.) the value for each new customer acquired goes up.

This is from my own valuation model, similar to Vanguards but not the same. So it's not ""them"" giving themselves leeway. It's also not me giving myself leeway. It's just the historical accuracy of the model. Yes, +/-4% a year over 10 years is a huge range. There's a really big difference in outcome if we experience the lower range, nominal, or upper range. It's why you have to be really careful reading article's like OP's and taking radical action based on it. You have to consider the accuracy and the entire probabilistic range of the forecast if you intend to use it to guide allocation decisions.

Using margin and simulating a 1% fee (as the article does) is not equivalent to leveraged ETFs and simulating a 1% fee, because margin tends to have both higher returns AND higher expenses. 

This entire time, I'm just asking you to share a back-test w/ leveraged ETFs  counts fees and you've shared 1 article that uses margin and 1 article that concludes that fees negate the returns. For something supposedly so easy to find, you're surely having a hard time finding it - you wonder why? 

All these articles show is the following if we count ""gross"" returns.

There is pretty significant data that shows that the value premium is very pronounced during periods of high inflation, but very neglible or even negative during periods of low inflation or deflation.

If you look at periods where growth have outperformed value:

1. 1930's great depression, a deflationary period. Bad economic conditions put value at significant risk with lots of bankruptcies.

2. 1990's, due to the tech bubble(which later reversed and led to value substantially outperforming in 2000's)

3. 2010's- a period following the great recession. Low interest rates as well as growth stocks being surprisingly cheap. Apple traded at a P/E below 9 in 2013, microsoft below 7 in 2011, Alphabet below 18 in 2011. It's not surprising that growth outperformed.

**1. Why don't explain what exactly you're arguing about (especially now that you've stayed this long)**

Your first comment implied that you've done (or seen) a 20 year back-test of LETF's and the results were ""awful"" and yet you never provided any detail what so ever about your back-test results or what the source is. All the while you **NEEDED** to see back test's which showed the opposite (yet never provided anything to the contrary for us to see).  
**2. Why don't you provide me with your well-researched back test which shows me why LETF's over the past 20 years have awful returns**

""In general the tracking error adds extra volatility to the ETF and there is a volatility drag that results. But due to the serial correlation and the **relatively small size of the drag the effect on the returns is small**""

I assume this was a reference to the graph which showed a back-test of US Equities as a whole from 1885 to 2009 and this illustrated that for this back-test it wouldn't have performed better as a LETF. However the VERY next graph shows a FAR FAR more relevant back-test of the S&P500 from 1950 to 2009 which indicates that a LETF is so far and away better than a non-leveraged ETF there really shouldn't be a debate. Please please please tell me I don't need to explain to you why I don't care about Whole US Stock Market returns from 1885 to 1950 when looking at a back-test of LETF's. If that or the argument about Tracking Error is the hill you want to die on then I'm out hahahah",[],0

Index funds go back to the 70s. VFIAX was created in 1976.

>Do ETFs really beating up active investing

ETFs and active investing aren't exclusive. Actively managed ETFs exist (see ARKK for example).

>Let's say people panic and start massively selling ETFs. Indexs can drops for 50% or even more. What happened when new money stop coming to passive funds?

Not all index funds are ETFs (see FSKAX for example), not all ETFs are index funds.

The funds rebalance as necessary to reflect new market conditions. If index funds drop, so will most actively managed funds and likely many individual stocks.

>Except few years, America has strong bull market for last three decades. It wasn't always like this. In 1930s to 1950s S & P 500 almost lost 3 decades. How ETFs will perform in long bear market?

There are many more index funds than just ones that cover the S&P 500. There's US total market (VTSAX for example). Also there are non-US index funds (SCHF, SCHE, FTIHX for a few examples).

>ETF is passive investment. But you still making an ACTIVE choice when pick up ETFs. Will be world ETF or will be S & P 500. There are like over 100 ETFs.

That's a decision you don't need to make too often.

>1. Buffet with Berkshire beating up S & P 500 and there is no dividend with Berkshire investment. It is tax optimal. Zero cost with provision and on top they performed much better in all crises.
2. Scottish mortgage investment trust outperform S & P as well
