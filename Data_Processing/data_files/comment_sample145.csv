The lawsuits that have been plaguing the news ticker for the last month are complete fairy tales when it comes to their claims about production and the battery fire. If you look into the engineering and current factory and beta status at all it's obviously bullshit. The claim about pre-orders has more teeth, but it's honestly pretty weak as a basis for any actual fraud.

The riskiest thing about this is the fact that it's speculative EV on a deadline for production. The engineering and manufacturing risks are very real and it's going to be a serious challenge to meet deadlines and compete in the coming markets. But lawsuits? I'm not even slightly worried (which is why I intentionally used the lawsuits to invest when the price was held down)

Normally, I wouldn't even invest in speculative EV as I don't trust the industry. But in this case I think the ties to GM, Elaphe, and Camping World combined with the logistical and financial valuation of their current factory set-up gives them a significant leg up.",[],1

I am walking back to my apartment and I am half-cut. I carry with me a slice of sausage pizza, a 6 pack of Lacroix pure sparkling water, and a bar of African Black Soap (for troubled skin). Work is going well, I get good praise from the supervisor for the work I do. And it feels like summer is here. I'll probably move to Brooklyn, I think. 

I get to my building and the night doorman says Hey how's it going

I say Hey

I get to the elevator door and I drop my slice of pizza.

65F Cloudy

I want a life like the cool spring breeze on a gentle stroll down Filbert Street, not the stifling taste of average despair of a crowded, sweltering post office line. A life like the fizzy-crisp pop of a fine Champagne, not the flaccid blandness of a stale Corona. A life like the hop-step of a jubilant child, not the measured gait of a tired, broken man.

I want to dive right into the balmy, inviting waters, not tiptoe forever cautiously around the brittle surface in fear. I want to be the patience and the warmth that thaws someone‚Äôs ice figure called heart, not the cracked window that sucks out the warmth of others. I want a life where abundance means sharing; not an obsessive attachment to material things I do not need. I want to sleep hard and deep on fresh linen that smells like lavender and cherry bonsais. To wake up feeling rejuvenated, intrigued, and eager for every new day, not tired, jaded and weary, mired in numb predictability.

My knights, /u/memetron9000 u/slugk0 u/angrysc0tsman12, u/EnigmaticRiddler, and my men at arms, u/SLOPTART69, u/some-other-guy-1 will follow me into the exciting, endless future.",[],1

During Monday's rally it was only about 15k shares of excess volume that drove the price up by about .50. So to cover the 1.76 you need to break even you only need to buy around 52,000 shares for about $437,000. But realistically if you put in a big order it will most likely start a rally so I bet on the low end you could buy half that many split up a bit and still break even. So best case you are only buying 26k shares for around $219,000.

So for the low, low price of a quarter to a half million dollars you can save yourself 14 grand. Plus after that you will have a whole bunch of UWMC you can use to sell covered calls to morons who make stupid bets based on internet rumors.",[],0

So if it were options I‚Äôd definitely sell at a higher than 35% loss to avoid a 100% loss. I kind of just picked the 35% number without really thinking about it. In general though if near term expiration wasn‚Äôt really an issue like with stocks or leaps and I were down a lot, I think there‚Äôs might be a good chance of a bounce to at least minimize my losses rather than selling at the bottom. Might be a little gamblers fallacy to that though. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gone down so much it can‚Äôt keep going down‚Äù ‚Äî Well actually yeah it can. Anyway I think such a bounce could provide faster gains than reinvesting in smarter positions in a different sector.  

As for best sector right now that I‚Äôd reinvest in? Idk that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm kinda waiting for June for new positions. I pretty much only sell credit put spreads so I want to wait for a good volatility spike which I think will happen in June. I actually took significant losses during the tech crash in February but if I had just held for longer I would‚Äôve been fine. I was at my peak but then lost almost 40% of my portfolio over those 2 weeks.

> Moses saw in vision that the Savior had created many worlds like this earth that were also inhabited (see Moses 1:27‚Äì29). The inhabitants of these worlds are sons and daughters of God and are precious in His sight. The Savior is responsible for these creations and visits them in their times and seasons. Elder Orson Pratt explained: ‚ÄúThe Lord wanted to represent these kingdoms so that we could understand what he desired to impart, and he gave it as a parable, in order to assist our weak comprehensions. ‚Ä¶ Says the interrogator‚Äî‚ÄòI do not comprehend this idea of the Lord‚Äôs withdrawing from one and going to another.‚Äô In order to comprehend this let us come back to our own globe. Do we not expect that the Lord will, by and by, come and visit us and stay a little while, about a thousand years. Yes, and then we shall be made glad with the joy of the countenance of our Lord. He will be among us, and will be our King, and he will reign as a King of kings and Lord of lords. He will have a throne in Zion, and another in the Temple at Jerusalem, and he will have with him the twelve disciples who were with him during his ministry at Jerusalem; and they will eat and drink with him at his table; and all the people of this globe who are counted worthy to be called Zion, the pure in heart, will be made glad by the countenance of their Lord for a thousand years, during which the earth will rest. Then what? He withdraws. What for? To fulfill other purposes; for he has other worlds or creations and other sons and daughters, perhaps just as good as those dwelling on this planet, and they, as well as we, will be visited, and they will be made glad with the countenance of their Lord. Thus he will go, in the time and in the season thereof, from kingdom to kingdom or from world to world, causing the pure in heart, the Zion that is taken from these creations, to rejoice in his presence.",[],1

They need to unwind that slowly to keep the market from collapsing.  Encouraging people to come to oil and commodities is admitting defeat before you've been able to get out of your positions.

If you look at the chart comparing oil price to oil stock prices there is a massive gap recently with the oil price being significantly higher than the stock prices.  The stock prices will start to come up and fill this gap.

Inventory levels are 1% below where they were in the last 5 years for crude, 5% for gasoline and 18% for natural gas in the us.  No big deal right, except, that we are running nowhere close to the number of rigs that we were in the past 5 years making it impossible to increase inventories When faced with increased demand.  We definitely could be seeing mother of all oil short squeezes.

Iran is already selling two and a half million barrels per day on the black market and some people estimate they could get up to 4 million barrels per day to sell if the sanctions between the US and Iran are lifted.  Saying you're going to make oil and actually doing it are two different things they can't just turn all these wells on and get up to that production level in two to three months like some are projecting they can.  It takes months to dig a well from scratch.  Reality check, Iran is already selling everything it has on the market right now and it's going to take them a min. Of 6 months to a year to increase to 4 million barrels a day. Saudi Arabia also has a massive interest in keeping prices high, So will be on the opposing end this.

Oil has multiple catalysts each week that throw it up or down in each direction making it the ultimate target for shorts.  As such, retailers have also picked up on this momentum and no one really holds overnight it's a lot of just penny stock trading at the moment.

It's funny watching everyone stumble over the different reasons why oil is down in a particular day today they said it was due to unexpected inventory increases.  The inventory increase was quite a bit smaller than what was forecasted, which should have been good news for oil.  Alas, We can blame Iran except that they came out and said oh no wait that deal's not going to go through yet.... Well then it's got to be demand....

Unfortunately, oil is the only sector that's has come up this year, which means there's a lot of room to short it and it seems like they're just making up excuses to slow the transition from growth to value stocks.  We've got wars looming, decreased inventories, decreased production. It's only a matter of time before the stock prices catch up.  If citadel goes under I think you'll see massive increases.",[],0

3078,gysbhtd,2021-05-20,t3_ngfiu9,wallstreetbets,"I also tried to DD these a little bit and here is what I came up with.

LBRDA - Though their revenue did go up, its still quarterly revenue of 243MM on a company with a market cap of over 30 billion.  The reason the market cap is so high has almost nothing to do with the new revenue.  The main driver of this stock's price for the foreseeable future is due to the fact that they own 26% (as of the last 10Q) of the stock of a much larger company - Charter Communications.  This stock was worth about 36 billion as of the last 10Q, so with a 36 billion dollar asset, its not hard to see why the market fives this company a 30 billion market cap.  I like the company though you can expect the stock price to simply mirror whatever Charter's stock does at least for now.  Anyhow, maybe a decent company but the revenue change is almost meaningless to the stock price (for now).

BeiGene - Their product revenue doubled last quarter from about 50 million to about 100 million.  In addition there was a 500 million payment, (booked as revenue because that's what it is) for a ""collaboration agreement"".  I didn't research exactly what the collaboration agreement was because I'm not that interested but its probably for another company to sell and market their drug in some other part of the world, or for another company to use their drug (pehaps with another drug) as part of product they will market. The good news is that the sales did double in 1 quarter and someone thought enough about the company to pay them 500 million to market or use their drug.  The bad news is that this is a one time event and without alot more info its impossible to put a real value on this company, but don't think its worth 6 times more money due to this - its a one time event.

NRG - From the most recent 10Q; ""On January 5, 2021 (the ""Acquisition Closing Date""), the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Direct Energy, a North American subsidiary of Centrica. Direct Energy is a leading retail provider of electricity, natural gas, and home and business energy related products and services in North America, with operations in all 50 U.S. states and 8 Canadian provinces. The acquisition increased NRG's retail portfolio by over 3 million customers and strengthens its integrated model. It also broadens the Company's presence in the Northeast and into states and locales where it did not previously operate, supporting NRG's objective to diversify its business.""  This is why the revenue went up so much. I find this one very interesting as the stock price has gone down since the acquisition (probably due to a nearly 1 billion dollar loss from the storm).  This company may do very well with this acquisition going forward but there is so much more to look at and understand than just the jump in revenue.

Anyhow, you may have 3 decent stocks here (more by luck than brilliant stock screening), but there is a lot more to finding good stocks than simply picking ones with huge jumps (usually temporary) in revenue.",[],0

3847,gysdoh5,2021-05-20,t1_gyrqym8,wallstreetbets,"Higher delta options are actually lower reward and lower risk. The delta of an option is a rough estimate of the odds of an option expiring ITM. An ATM call will have a ~50 delta, and it has roughly a 50% chance of expiring ITM. A deep OTM call will have a 10-30 delta, and it has lower odds of expiring in the money. 


If you spend $500 on options, you will be able to achieve a higher total delta with cheaper options. Also, if you buy just one option and the underlying increases by $1, the higher delta call option will increase by a larger dollar amount, but the lower delta call option will increase by a larger percentage (usually). People on WSB trade deep OTM calls because they can easily multiply in value by orders of magnitude if the trade goes your way. For instance, with GME, someone on here bought a deep OTM call option for $6 (total contract price) and sold it for $2,000. Someone with a deep ITM call option might have paid $2,000 for it, and would have made maybe $20,000 (this number is made up, but you get the idea). The deep OTM calls went up 100x+, while the deep ITM call options may have only gone up 10x. If someone was crazy enough to take that $2000 and buy as many deep OTM GME calls as they could, they would have made ~$660,000 (using the made up numbers). On the other hand, if someone bought an $800 call on GME, they would have lost their entire investment, while someone with a deep ITM call would possibly have some intrinsic value left. GameStop is an extreme example, but the point stands. If you look at what DFV bought on GME, they were all long term, deep OTM call options. That is how he had 1000x returns at the peak of GME. 


If you are trading 0DTE or weekly options like OP, buying OTM options are much riskier, as the option is 100% extrinsic value. If the trade goes against you or stays flat, or even goes up slightly, you could lose your whole investment. If you buy a high delta option that is 0DTE, and the underlying stays flat, you will lose the extrinsic value of the option but you will retain the intrinsic value of the option, as it can be exercised for a profit.",['GME'],0

Mortgage companies make money when delinquencies go up via loss mitigation activities. 
Mortgage companies make money when rates slowly rise via mortgage servicing rights. 

The only way mortgage companies really lose money is when they make big bets in the direction of the market and they‚Äôre wrong. For example, they think rates will slowly rise so they buy a bunch of mortgage servicing rights, and then there‚Äôs a sudden dip in rates. Now all the loans will refinance before they make the money back on the Msrs.

When I say ""you"" below, I am really meaning me - this is my pep talk to me (and to anyone else who likes hearing pep talks).  


I say to myself:  
A single share of GME is the savviest risk/reward investment you will ever make. A chance to hold the cheaters and market manipulators accountable, collectively with our single voice, or commitment to stand together and demand accountability, and reform, and justice. This isn't about the money. I would rather live in a world where capital and investments were managed with fairness, and transparency and where cheaters don't win, than keep the value of one (1) GME share in this crooked fucked up world where cheaters are winning the game and refereeing it too.  
This is the price of a Stars Air Ambulance lottery ticket or a Children's Hospital raffle, a Donation to your favorite political party or church or community garden. An evening of entertainment to the biggest show of 2021.  
All it takes is one (1) GME share. Buy and Hold my (diamond) hand. Let's stand up for justice and accountability. Let's hold not for money, but for accountability and justice and a better world for everyone.  
We are standing at the precipice of another 2008 Market Crash. The same pieces of shits and their pals who overleveraged and cooked the books and committed illegal acts behind closed doors back in 2008 are here again.  
If we stand together, even when it is scary and the price goes down or they threaten us, or lie to us, then we overcome. We can shine a light on these dirty deeds, if we stand together.  
Apes are strong together. Holding hands together. Facing the precipice. Facing the monster in the dark. Together we are strong.

Stocks only go up


*This economic data looks grim,* I think to myself. *This is the right move.* I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 6/19 SPY 200p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.

I come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&P 500. 2700. Out of its bear market.

I hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. ""What am I-"" 

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he asks.

""Huh?"" I respond, confused.

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he demands, louder this time.

""I, uh... the coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's going to cause-"" **WHAM!** One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.

""It's priced in,"" he says coolly. ""So why did you short the domestic market?""

Dizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&P has climbed back to 2850. *Impossible*, I think to myself. ""Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 20 percent!"" I manage to answer. **WHAM!** Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.

""Repeat after me: stocks only go up,"" Powell demands.

I say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary *guh* escapes my mouth as it falls agape.

Powell frowns and continues, ""I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?""

I feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, ""GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-"" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.

""Stocks only go up,"" Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.

The first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.

""Stocks only go up,"" I say.",[],0

Scarcity of a resource.  Whether it is engineering talent, patents on a product or capability to deliver a vehicle... its stock is considered valuable and bought up.  New shares aren‚Äôt issued often and the last split I was in was something like 1:5

So just like the price of a commodity doesn‚Äôt dictate value, neither can the core metrics.  We can look at HD, LOWE and even AAPL demonstrating value, but getting hammered after earnings due to weaker guidance.  

So people are betting on future opportunity along with a scarcity of stocks.  

I exited at $750 myself, and based upon current market factors, would peg it at less than $500 right now.  If the market gets cut by one-half, massive more printing of more USD, or more bad news from China, that valuation would decreased.

7556,gysz5pg,2021-05-20,t1_gyr7l96,wallstreetbets,"Well, it‚Äôs a simple matter on how the market works. Not to be rude, but how long have you been trading? Stocks go in cyclical patterns, up and down, up and down, depending on many factors (mostly fundamental), but also the overall market, interest rates, inflation, technicals, etc.

Right now if you do a free cash flow analysis of AMC, debt, growth, income, etc, you‚Äôll see that the stock has a fundamental value of around 5 dollars aprox (it has always traded in that range even when it was actually going well pre-pandemic, now the situation is much worse).

The retail craze has made ‚Äòmeme‚Äù stocks such as GME and AMC completely diesregard any fundamental or technical analysis. It‚Äôs just a simple ‚Äúmass psychology‚Äù experiment, if people think it could go up a lot, they will buy in, and as long as this keeps going on, it goes up. But it‚Äôs also a classic case of the ‚Äúprisoner‚Äôs dilemma‚Äù, when if a single piece ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù, everything goes down, because the ‚Äútrue‚Äù value of AMC is much lower. For example, many pieces ‚Äúbroke‚Äù yesterday and that‚Äôs why it came crashing down - everybody wants to make their profit and don‚Äôt wanna end up be holding bags, since trading is definitely not a team game. When somebody wins, BY DEFINITION, somebody must lose. 

And it‚Äôs not bad to take profit, many people who had bought yesterday at 9 dollars sold at 15 to make more that a 50% profit, this is an insane ROI. But any quite of speculative bubble (and AMC is one, nobody is even doubting that) eventually goes back to reality as people don‚Äôt wanna get caught in the crash and want to actually make a profit.

So that‚Äôs the simple truth - when a stock is overvalued, it eventually corrects back to its true price. This happens in every single stock in the market eventually, be it good companies such as APPL, AMZN or GOOG (a good company is one that has a great discounted cash flow model, healthy growth, and a unique advantage over competitors), or shitty ones like GME or AMC.","['GME', 'AMC']",1

Software developers write programs for a platform, they will usually pick the most popular platform, reinforcing the value of that platform over time. This makes it more difficult for new players to enter the space.

As an example, see how Apple was not able to get a good market share until the industry switched to using webapps, and the issue of platorm dominance switched to the browsers (With firefox now being almost unusable since developers only support chrome).

For these reasons, it's normal to expect super-normal profits for a successful hardware company.

We're not going to have cookie-clicker apps on our cars, we'll have entertainment systems, and GPS, etc, but there is already an established, mature industry around providing these subsystems for cars. We don't have the platform-dominance effect.

Your little slogans don't change the facts, Teslas are not as much of a leap forward as iPhones were compared to the older generation flip-phones. It's still just a vehicle that gets you from A to B.

I don‚Äôt like the guidance on PLUG, so I‚Äôm trying to find a better charging station play to make a Bull case for. You‚Äôve obviously thought this through, so I‚Äôm simply writing this for the other redditors who will never read it.

The latter may be muted because of hyper-inflation and the government‚Äôs interference with printing money, buying assets (even junk bonds) and keeping interest rates at zero.  I guess I‚Äôm more idealistic, in that I believe the market‚Äôs purpose is to provide capital for businesses to start and grow. I think a great deal of investment is still long term buy and hold, but the speculation / trading has increased dramatically, both institutionally and retail, through online trading, and of course the explosion of derivatives trading, not to mention crypto.",['TSLA'],0

Risk checks help us to identify orders that don't quite make sense in the context of where the stock is currently trading in the market, such as a $1,000 limit sell order for a stock currently trading at $5. This means that your order may be canceled if the price of the security moves significantly away from your limit or stop price and is then seen as too aggressive.""

Apparently Robinhood has a $5 price target for GME because they let me place a $55 limit order on my 1 free share of MGI (similar percent).

8708,gyt66zw,2021-05-20,t3_ngp2r1,wallstreetbets,"A good product does not mean a good business model. SNDL seems like they want to be the 'fine wine' of the cannabis market while other companies are competing to drive down prices with less potent, but apparently much cheaper to produce products and strains. 

&#x200B;

It's great and all that they want to make the most potent product possible but if an eighth of pretty-good-but-not-the-best weed costs $40 and an eighth of their product costs $50-$60 (just spitballing these numbers) they are assuming that consumers both care enough about the enhanced quality of their product to shell out for it (I think most people on average would just get the cheaper weed and simply smoke more) as well as trust their brand.

&#x200B;

I would much rather they had come out and announced they were consolidating their product line to cut costs and streamline production. 

&#x200B;

In my opinion they should focus on maybe 3 high-end strains total: one Sativa, one Indica, and maybe one hybrid. When I care about getting the best bud I'm not going to be looking at a bunch of different strains to try something new, I'm going to stick to what I *know* is good. If I know that SNDL is the best product and I want a Sativa I am most likely going to arbitrarily pick a strain and then stick with it if it was as good as advertised. Someone else might arbitrarily pick a different strain and do the same thing. Now you have to stock a multitude of products in order to keep your customer base happy when most likely they both would have been happy with the same choice if they had just so happened to pick it first. Other than those they should also sell similar strains at a mid-grade level quality that would be able to compete in pricing with their competitors. 

&#x200B;

When it comes to Vape Carts *that's* where you can open up your product line a bit more as from my experience people *love* trying different flavor carts from brands they trust. They wouldn't even need to grow additional strains they could just have their 'vanilla' strains in cart form and then run the flavor gamut from blueberry to fruity pebbles. That being said they are down significantly in sales from Q4 2020 in this sector so it might be better to just nix it altogether and focus on the only market sector in which they were *almost* able to compete with their Q4 numbers

&#x200B;

These 2 categories contributed roughly $11.5 mil in sales, Concentrates and Oils contributed about $680k. IMO it just doesn't make sense for an unprofitable company to be in these sectors. Not only are they seeing only a pittance in returns by way of sales, there is additional overhead associated with the processes of making the oils and concentrates. Literally spending more money to make less.

If you are long congrats. However if you are gonna tell me about their amazing tech & innovation fuck off!  UPST is just another overvalued, Ai, SaaS, Payment High-flyer who forgot it‚Äôs 2021 but IPO‚Äôed late last year under the shadow of ABNB & DASH however just like the ladder two GOLDMAN is also their Godfather (took all 3 public) and GS takes care of it‚Äôs babies.  Compared to it‚Äôs more celebrated peers UPST was of to a slow start. IPO‚Äôed at $20 (the low end of the range $20 - $24), hardly drew any buzz and post IPO sat around for a few days kinda lost. 

GOLDMAN TO THE RESCUE: Once Goldman shoved a stupidly high valuation which the market accepted for ABNB & DASH then it focused it‚Äôs attention on poor little UPST and started to drive interest for the shares (part of the GS starter kit when you select them to run your IPO which founders & round investors love.  They need to make sure to pump the price hard before lock-up expiration *THIS IS KEY.

RECAP: UPST, went public at $20 in Dec the week after the other two and once public had a $1.8 Billion valuation and already trading at a rich valuation (just earlier in 2020 it has been valued around $800MM).  

TODAY‚Äôs VALUATIONS: Fast forward; today UPST is valued over $10 Billion trading at a whopping $135 per share Est PE: 200X PS: 40X PB: 30X (regardless of future potential growth these are disgustingly high valuations) oh JUST OVER 40% OF THE SHARES ARE STILL LOCKED!  

TRADE / LOCKUP EXPIRATION / JULY: Lock you for UPST is scheduled for early July which will increase the float by 40% and this event will trigger pressure on the shares (round investors selling, in creasing the supply) and mixed with a higher interest rate environment and stupid high valuations WILL CUT THE CURRENT PRICE BY AT LEAST 50%. (You know very well every single 2020 high flyer was cut in half this year. UPST is no exception just delayed). 

PROOF:  Goldman was the investment bank for several other similar IPO‚Äôs and applied the same formula.  Check to procure movements, IPO, ramp up, expiration lockup followed by substantial decrease of share prices.  SNOW, DASH, ABNB, BIGC, FROG, PLTR.

Ahahahahhahahah how the fuck does that line up with your headline. 

It's fucking may 20, one whole fucking month before summer and they still haven't launched trials and you think they're gonna sell vaccines by summer. 

In case, the writers of Fool and OP never learned anything on Sesame Street. After 1 comes 2, and 3. Perhaps you're learning from the wrong Count Vlad.

AND then a whole world's worth of regulatory approvals hoopla. Good fucking luck. Maybe summer of 2022. Also keep in mind they aren't 1st (Pfizer), 2nd (Moderna), 3rd (Astra Zeneca), 4th (Sputnik V), 5th (Sinovac), 6th (JNJ), 7th (NovaVax), 8th (Ocugen/Bharat).
