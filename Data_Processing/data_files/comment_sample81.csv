Today session low was 24.10 but we were hovering at 25.80 strong during market and post market. Price hasn't dropped since Thursday's major bull run.

Institutional investors definitely have skin in the game. Volume of 659 million. Some candles had major lift that needs millions to do so

Since the trading day did not lose much ground from the previous day, the only way shares would trade lower is heavy shorting at around $34ish today and buying back lower and repeat.

All charts identical today for all ""meme stocks"". They were ready and they just wanted bullish calls to expire.

Another catalyst would be states like NY actually legalizing.  That would grow their customer base.

But even if whatever you call ""synthetic shares"" is something else that does confer voting rights, the corporation would have to know that they exist first in order for holders of such shares to be counted by the corporation as voters - because remember there is no such thing as not voting, you vote for management by default or against it, or some combination on specific issues.",[],0

1673,gztkotl,2021-05-29,t3_nnagy5,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately, you only have a couple of choices. First, if you like the stock and you feel good about its prospects going forward you can double down on the stock at this point which will reduce your cost basis and allow you to sell the stock at a price which is lower than what your initial cost basis would be if you did nothing. Secondly, you can sell some covered calls in the options market for a strike price at or a little higher than where you bought the stock at earlier. This will allow you to collect a premium for your shares which is yours no matter what happens with the stock price. However, if the price of the stock reaches your selected strike price before expiration the buyer of your covered call has the right to have your stock called away but has to pay you for your stock at this given price. So, in the covered call senerio you will collect a premium for your shares and the price of your stock if it gets called away. Hopefully, this would help you at least break even or maybe even make a little money. Also, if the stock never reaches your strike price before expiration you get to keep the premium paid by the buyer and you can do it all over again. Do this on a high volume day which drives the option price higher. Good luck",[],0

Many people don’t even realize we are off the gold standard, if things like gold and silver were stop being manipulated, and shoot up in value, it would expose the true value of the dollar, and people would quickly lose confidence in the economy. This would lead to almost a reverse run on the bank, where everyone start buying whatever stores of value aside from the dollar that they can, as fast as they can. Basically what the smart people and large companies are doing now, but when the masses start doing it things get pretty wild. Most average people are so sleepy that they actually think the dollar *is* backed up by *something*, so when they find out it’s not, and that it’s failing, they will certainly panic.

But when I asked if I could get a discount on the premium if I were to buy 300-500 oz, the answer was usually ""no"" and ""we'd after to order it... we're empty."" Only two brokers were willing to reduce their premiums by $1-$2 per oz. If you've seen the recent /SIN21 chart (Silver June 2021), you'll notice a huge increase in volume in May. From what I gathered, there are lots of ""regular folks"" buying tons of physical silver on the rumors of pending inflation. As we all know, markets move on emotion, news, and what the big funds are doing. I don't know what the big funds are doing. I'm not up-to-date about the silver news. But when I see the average person stocking up on physical silver instead of toilet paper, and during all this time CNBC has attacked anyone who mentioned ""inflation"" or ""correction"", then it's a momentum I can't ignore. I'm not saying silver is ""going to $100"" or whatever. I don't trust big funds. I don't trust the news. However I do notice when average people (like me) suddenly change course and make significant changes to their lives.

When hedgies short stocks they have to buy the shares back from sellers to cover their position and pocket the difference. If we don't sell then there are no shares for the hedgies to buy. Eventually with strong volume buying the hedgies sh*t their pants because they have to cover at a much higher price and possibly go bankrupt. High interest for borrowed shares also come into play.

Most brokers will email you a link for your proxy-vote. A few EU/Asian brokers might abstain by submitting blank votes. Those still get counted towards the total of votes received by the AMC board.

When the AMC board ends up with a lot more votes than the 450 million outstanding shares it will be up to them what steps they take. But they'll have proof of naked shorting activity.

You have the “right” to push a single dose of narcotics, but when frequent flier comes in weekly with a script for enough norco to put down a pack of elephants 100 times over for an entire month, the pharmacist makes a judgement call not to fill. Even if it’s a valid real script, if he fills his, he could lose his licenses (Atleast in California). 

Not only that, my friends cvs is next to a pain management clinic, so they have to constantly check the state database to see if a patient has already received a max allotment.  

Occasionally I have lunch with him and so I go into his cvs. Every single time he’s been in an argument with one person or another because he refuses to fill a narcotic script. Sometimes it’s because one was filled last week or other times it’s because he feels that the script is fake and doesn’t want to deal with liability. 

On the other hand, you make a judgement call in an emergency situation, that’s what you are trained to do. Give a drug seeker 100 norcos or 10 doses of Dilaudid and let him walk away and see if you’re still a medic in a months time.",[],0

Had to sign non disclosures and shit and was paid under the table. We also created an algo to spoof the offer and bid, to essentially control the stock as we pleased. Our code was also applied to derivatives. We were limited on computing power so we cut the algos were we thought it may be unnecessary, such as far otm options once they were 3-2 dte. We weren’t really used to derivatives, since we ran this program on otc pieces of dog shit. I once stopped BofA from a 26MM margin call using only two mobile devices from a fucking subway. I thought this was easy. However, we never thought so many people would been excuse me, but— “retarded” enough to essentially crack the code of our algo and work around its controling the stock price by simply “yoloing” their life savings into furthest out of the money calls. I went to the lab today and all of our machines were gone. Everything was gone. There was only a note reading— “dead men tell no tales”.

This shit is going down down down.

-@Kevin

I posted a DD on a different wallstreetbets sub a few weeks ago for shorting peloton. I was considering updating it and posting it here again on the main wallstreetbets sub. I’ve been tracking the number of available bikes on FB, CL, and the number seems to be trending up. But it will take a few more weeks to get a good sense of where that is heading. I haven’t posted this on the yahoo finance board because it’s just such a pain in the ass to post on there and make it clear what you’re trying to say. 

I’m also tracking the comment volume on r/pelotoncycle in the New Buyer Thread. The trends on that are a bit mixed. Comment volume was headed down until recently. But the overall trends for the popularity of the subreddit r/pelotoncycle are heading down. The same can be said for other social media accounts for peloton. Other metrics I’m also looking at like App Store ranking, website traffic, etc are already compiled on various sites so I don’t need to track them. But again, those trends point towards slowing growth. 

Now, of course you don’t need to know all of these things to have the view that this shit stock is headed down. I personally wanted to track these metrics to confirm that I’m at least in the right ballpark when it comes to timing the drop. I do think that “investors aka speculators” are nervous and will bail quickly if the growth narrative changes. It’s my expectation that the slowing growth will be confirmed in the next conference call, and especially when they give projections for FY 2022. 

Of course, things could also go the other way. The execs are the biggest cheerleading group in the world.  They skirt saying anything negative about the business and try to be vague around things which could potentially be bad. I can’t say if it’s fraud or not, as I’m not an expert, but they skate a very thin line. Nobody knows for sure when the stock will bang on down to where it should be.

I’ve went back and forth on actually sharing this stuff here because I don’t think it’s necessary for the stock to drop. There is also no guarantee that the post gains traction. Of course, back in March of last year being a bear was all the rage. At the end of the day, people are here to make (mostly lose) money. So I could see people hopping on board if it was well written and compelling. But what does that accomplish? It would make your borrow rate go up and puts more expensive. Great for short term profits, but bad for long term profits. 

By the way, people on here love pictures, charts with big trend arrows, and they need things spelled out very clearly. Most won’t read. And actually, most of them hate hate hate bears and will probably never consider shorting. You’d have to convince them that the company is destroying something they value. Perhaps child murder is enough of a reason, who knows.",[],0

Tesla was shorted because its valuation was disproportionate to its financials. People commenting that it’s not a safe investment are doing so because its valuation is disproportionate to its financials. Any company whose valuation is disproportionate to its financials will get shorted. The shorters are not commenting at you, and you’re turning a stats problem into a team sport like a cultists.

> Is Tesla $800 right now? I’m talking about buying it at the current $600ish valuation it is now.

What analysis did you do that led you to the conclusion that it was worth more than what you bought it for? What math went into that?

> If Tesla was $800 or $900 and I said to buy that would be me telling you to buy at the top, but I’m not. I’m saying to buy when it’s low.

Nobody’s going to win here. In closing your bud can hand out drugs that if used inappropriately could kill people.

3865,gztqrwa,2021-05-29,t1_gztl7xd,wallstreetbets,"Ah, I thought you disagreed with the sentiment. Regardless, prices for everything don’t go up naturally given inflation, or the degree of increase will vary wildly. This depends on the level of inflation observed, and where easy money is put into the system. In an investment sense, money shifts to safe havens. Therefore prices of risky junk bonds or stocks might actually go down as investors seek safe shelter. In other words some prices will actually drop as inflation shifts consumer or institutional $$$ between sectors. For ex, consumers might buy less purple dildos and more silver! Hehe 

Hope this makes sense. The idea is that some goods are indicators of inflation and some are not at all. You seem to understand the illusion of paper fiat and this makes me happy. Cheers GB",[],0

If we want to eat the rich we need to turn our attentions to the little company and I’m talking the small businesses that are building and thriving in the OTC land of pink sheets real penny stocks. Big hedge fund investors always say oh don’t invest in penny stocks they are scams well that is absolutely false back in the 90s when the PennyStocks were hot and the tech bubble was happening big corporate flooded the pennies with scam companies yes and then they outed them as well to cause panic within the PennyStocks causing massive sell offs and fear of the market. All this was caused on purpose to prevent the middle class from having a chance. But you know what started as a penny stock and came out of that bubble and survived to move on? Apple and Microsoft. They don’t want you trading pennies cause they don’t want the middle class to get ahead but the PennyStocks were made for the middle class so that we could grow and develop new businesses and so that the middle class could get ahead by making long term investments into companies that value their shareholders not pump and dumps. Big cooperations also don’t want those small innovative companies to become competition for them but look history repeats itself and these pennies have been working on their companies and have been developing innovative technologies for years they are making their moves and they are ready to help America into the future we need just start doing some research and you will see I won’t name any specific ones but there are so many amazing things happening in these companies and guess what they are only valued at .04 or .50 or some even .001 because everyone is wasting money and pouring it into companies that don’t need your investments whatsoever you are just lining the pockets of their CEOs when they dump their shares on you and the rebuy later and they do it again and you guys keep funding them. And guess what the sec will be removing every non reporting stock here in the next month or so making the entire OTC full of legit and growing small businesses there has litterally never been a better opportunity than now to eat the rich. Also you can’t get these stocks on robinhood or else many of you would already be on this movement in history. Where the middle class takes back America. Idk just my thoughts man,['AAPL'],0

This would make it prime for a big squeeze due to illegal short selling, and market corruption creating synthetic shares). 

GME also has it's shareholders vote on the 9th June which is expected to be way over 100%. My personal advice is hold shares for now, but move to the stock with the highest vote count over 100% when the results are in, as this would be the best chance of a squeeze and will be the catalyst for other stocks to squeeze following it.

4832,gzttm41,2021-05-29,t1_gztso06,wallstreetbets,"SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE

Processed soy is particularly bad. Whereas fermented, organic soy in small amounts (like natto) does not pose serious health risks, eating soy protein isolate will definitely take its toll on the body.

Some effects of soy include decreased libido, mood swings, depression, and several others.

This study from Harvard found that men consuming the equivalent of one cup of soy milk per day had 50% lower sperm count than men who did not consume soy. That includes even counting other factors like age, caffeine and alcohol intake, etc.

JUST WAIT. THERE’S MORE.

This study found that soy stimulated the growth of estrogen-dependent tumors found in breast cancer. And this one found the same thing.

This study found that,

“…this pilot study indicates that prolonged consumption of soy protein isolate has a stimulatory effect on the premenopausal female breast, characterized by increased secretion of breast fluid, the appearance of hyperplastic epithelial cells, and elevated levels of plasma estradiol. These findings are suggestive of an estrogenic stimulus from the isoflavones genistein and daidzein contained in soy protein isolate.“

Soy is high in phytic acid, also known as phytates. These phytates prevent the absorption of minerals like iron and calcium (among others). This can be particularly harmful, especially for children.


Additionally, soy is high in phytoestrogen (source). This can block normal estrogen, wich leads not just to hormonal imbalance, but even breast cancer.

Note: this is why my periods were so heavy, painful and irregular when I was a vegetarian as a teen.

YEAST EXTRACT AKA MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE (MSG)

MSG hides under many names and yeast extract is one of them. MSG is an excitotoxin, i.e. it overstimulates the nervous system.

If we want to eat the rich we need to turn our attentions to the little company and I’m talking the small businesses that are building and thriving in the OTC land of pink sheets real penny stocks. Big hedge fund investors always say oh don’t invest in penny stocks they are scams well that is absolutely false back in the 90s when the PennyStocks were hot and the tech bubble was happening big corporate flooded the pennies with scam companies yes and then they outed them as well to cause panic within the PennyStocks causing massive sell offs and fear of the market. All this was caused on purpose to prevent the middle class from having a chance. But you know what started as a penny stock and came out of that bubble and survived to move on? Apple and Microsoft. They don’t want you trading pennies cause they don’t want the middle class to get ahead and they definitely don’t want those small innovative companies to become competition for them but look history repeats itself and these pennies have been working on their companies and have been developing innovative technologies for years they are making their moves and they are ready to help America into the future we need just start doing some research and you will see I won’t name any specific ones but there are so many amazing things happening in these companies and guess what they are only valued at .04 or .50 or some even .001 because everyone is wasting money and pouring it into companies that don’t need your investments whatsoever you are just lining the pockets of their CEOs when they dump their shares on you and the rebuy later and they do it again and you guys keep funding them. And guess what the sec will be removing every non reporting stock here in the next month or so making the entire OTC full of legit and growing small businesses there has litterally never been a better opportunity than now to eat the rich. Also you can’t get these stocks on robinhood or else many of you would already be on this movement in history. Where the middle class takes back America. Also might want to look at the short interest that’s been happening in the OTC as well 😘,['AAPL'],0

PM won’t protect you from downturns in the economy.  PM do best when you have negative real interest rates(IE - 10 year bond is currently 1.75% and inflation is tracking at 4.25% = real interest rate of -2.5%) or when the public looses faith in the financial system.  PM actually don’t protect you from inflation in the short term but do in the long term.  They are the only investment I know of that has no counter party risk.  And I see a lot of counter party risk out there.  I am also a value investor and I don’t see much value anywhere except for a few things and silver/silver miners are one of them.  And they happen to be one of the best defenses for inflation which I think is likely.  

Read William Bernstein Deep Risk-he goes into various scenarios and how best to protect yourself.  Ray Dalio Big Debt Crises is good to get a feel for debt bubbles and how they usually play out in various countries.  

Depends on what type of collapse.  You can collapse down and up too.  If the fed raises rates and causes a recession/depression - not sure PM do that well(Volker in the 1980s) If we have a stagflation event like the 70s, they will probably do great.  08 - PM didn’t do well.

The infrastructure is actually there for H2 via pipelines.  Its quite brilliant actually that they can tie into existing NG infrastructure.  At one time in the 1800s America used Hydrogen as a fuel source.

These times are amazing for what the future can hold.  Im quite optimistic that one day everyone will have all the power they want very cheaply.  Batteries are great and portable, but I have some reservations about wide scale adoption (worldwide)  They are disposable, prone to danger, made from materials that are unsustainable.  At least in its present state.  No doubt there will be millions of battery operated vehicles in the next decade, but I think ICE can still and should be a viable option.

Think of an apartment complex.  Hundreds of people needing to charge at the same time (for work or school) it would be a disaster if they dont get things figured out.

Also, I hope H2 can be made locally and tie into the grid.  That is somewhat of a pipe dream but wouldnt it be cool if you powered your home and made your own gas for driving?  While feeding back into the grid for others.

H2 incidently has been around longer than battery tech.  Check this out (bottom of the page is the oldest H2 cars):
https://www.hydrogencarsnow.com/index.php/1807-1986/

There is a major misconception that H2 is some a new and novel concept.  But its been with us for centuries.  Decades ago, car manufacturers tried to make it a thing but incidently the oil people you spoke of kept it from being mainstream.

Every competent human being should be able to cook from the internet. The fact is, people are buying these meal kits. The question is not whether or not this is a sustainable business model, I’ve written at least a dozen times to look at hellofresh which is not only a ten bagger after a few years, but is actually fundamentally sound as well.

The question is whether or not Blue Apron can escape bankruptcy or not. Do they sell the business to a larger competitor. Do they refinance the debt. Do they die. That’s the only thing in question. They very well might die, but it has nothing to do with the viability of meal kits.",[],0

Do not tell me that there are safe stocks, as even the S&P 500 index abs blue chip companies like Disney got cut in half.

The guy didn't realise that DFV had sold anything, ever. And thought that he had just randomly bought another 50,000 shares with cash that he had on hand (or something idk).

Dec 31 - Jan 5
DFV sells 1000 calls (100,000 shares worth) and buys 40,000 shares. (may have sold 600 calls and excersized the rest. I don't remember) 

Jan 13 - 14
DFV sells 1000 Calls at the $20 strike

Jan 22-25
DFV sells 200 Calls at the $12 strike

Jan 27
DFV sells 300 Calls at the $12 strike

Feb
DFV buys 50,000 shares

April
DFV excersizes 50,000 shares worth of call options and buys 50,000 shares.",[],0

If you will excuse just a tiny bit of my snobbery I have a small critique about any canned coffee. Coffee has a lot of volatile aromatic compounds. As soon as espresso is extracted, the volatiles start evaporating. the espresso also starts oxidising as soon as its extracted. Although the espresso/coffee drink is sealed inside the can, by the time it starbucks or other brands goes from extracting the espresso to actually sealing the drink away, a lot of damage is already done.

Not because they're new, or because they spam the daily threads with unoriginal bullshit all week long, but because they're supporting the antithesis of wall WSB means to me.

You see, classic wallstreetbets was a place for autistic burger flippers and office workers to engage in extremely speculative high-leverage stock gambles. It was a place where regular internet trolls could come to engage in hard-core ruthless capitalism for the chance of making tendies. Regular people could cosplay as a coked up 80s stock broker.

Part of the beauty of the community was the ruthlessness of it all, and the solidarity behind that ruthlessness. We were all well aware that we were communicating with other autists who were also trading super leveraged options positions, sometimes on the other side of the same stock. The bears teased the bulls on red days, and the bulls called the bears gay every other day. We all knew what was on the table, and everyone was competing against each other. 

Then these GME kids flooded the sub. They don't want to take highly leveraged positions on random companies. They just want to hold shares. They don't want to take a gamble in the market, they want to take a strategic position on a specific company to guarantee a short squeeze for profit. 

Now putting aside all of that boomer shit, the real major offense is the desire to work as a collective. These guys just want to have a common enemy in ""the hedgies"". 

The beauty of the WSB community was that we don't make enemies or work together or work against each other. IDGAF if anyone else's MU calls print, as long as mine do. And if your MU puts print, I can celebrate your gains while you celebrate my losses. The tendies aren't in the profits you take, they're in the risk you take.

Wu Tang Forever. Short $SQ till the day I die.

-Saw a certain Friday DD.  If you know, know.  Didn't like what it said.

-OIP showed us a few weeks ago what the bots over on subreddit simulator act like.  Eerily similar to here.  You ever get in conversations where you're not really certain the person you're talking to is even directly responding to what you wrote?  Not even just bad logic or differences in opinion..  Like, the words just don't make sense as a response.  

-I went back a few months to read how we were all talking about GME and our potential to move markets, when it was clear that GME was going to blast the fuck off but BEFORE the squeeze.  We were still in the 40-60 range.  We got a visit from an actual hedge fund manager at that point in time, telling us we were headed in the right direction.

How many of the apes around here are just bots?  We never really moved on from ""the two stocks.""  I know lots of people here made money this week, but...

1) how much of the diamond hands sentiment is just to ensure retail plays its useful idiot role for HF's to make money on low liquidity stocks, and to ensure they can liquidate into the strength of frenzied buyers.  I.e. the big boys realize gains at the top while retail buys the top and holds it all the way down 

2) the thing we were so giddy about, the strength of retail, is never going to happen if retail at large is fixated on two stocks that aren't very important, keep all their liquidity locked up, and drown out other potential plays.

The traders are making bank and leaving newbies holding the bag. All these complicated intricate theories are speculation at best. They sell you on something you don’t understand and convince you to buy at the top of a parabolic rally. They will keep saying “that wasn’t the squeeze” when there wasn’t and won’t be a squeeze.

Add up all the open interest for prices higher than the closing. Multiply X 100 for total shares.
Then divide by the weighted average of the deltas of those open interest strike prices to get a rough number of how many shares had to be bought for Hedging.

Then take out 50% because not all options are sold by market makers. Or pick your own %. 

(Then realize that MMs don't hedge in real time all the time. Oftentimes they buy shares the next day, it depends on the risk of their overall portfolio. But let's assume they did hedge today all day)

Normally it pisses me off when people complain about old wsb because most of the time it's also newer accounts with hardly any skin in the game. You did sum it up well though on what this sub was supposed to be. One of my first successful options trades was Lumber Liquidators I'm sure you remember that shit. After that I was hooked. To be fair the ape tards did take most of the craze to their own subs so it's not as bad but there are also users on the other side talking out of their ass saying the squeeze is over and that gme is overvalued. However I look at the price today and it can't be true, yet they're on their high horse calling apes stupid. Again alot of those users barely have skin in the game yet they are loud as well. I think the answer is to enforce rules on the sub to keep everything related to options trades, no more shares. Make an exception for theta gang since they're still in options.

Do you understand what dilution is? Do you realize how it could potentially impact a company that doubles the number of share outstanding every time the stock market gets an influx of liquidity?

Using phrases like ""easy money"" when describing stocks that are less than a dollar per share is absurd, and a clear sign of somebody who is either trying to scam others, or currently getting scammed.

Add to that, when I posted this in February, later that day my Twitter was hacked by some IP in Russia, and then immediately linked to an Onlyfans account. I can only imagine their intent with that Onlyfans account was, or what it could've possibly had to do with this, but it doesn't take a mathematician to put two and two together.

Anyways, I'd love to see Sundial perform well, but it seems the company is shorting itself. Open up any database on current and historical options trades (I suggest Fidelity, they don't bullshit you with the Greeks so you'll have to find that elsewhere or just do it yourself, but they give you better historical data in a less nonsensical format than I've seen any else) along side the sec's SNDL filings and try to put them together. You'll see before any big announcement (usually of another shelf offering), a shit ton of ludicrously otm options are sold, then their a rise in price, and a return to the old trend towards zero.

You must have a committed a shit ton of money to the company, because you're acting like your life depends on their success. What does arguing with an ""internet rando"" get you here if you're so sure that I'm dependent on their failure? I have no position in the company whatsoever anyways.

I own no positions in the company, but I love arguing, and I love wasting time on a Friday night. What do you get out of this?",[],1

People tend to resort to alternative measures of currencies for protection against instability/inflation.  I honestly wish we had more charted history for cryptos to compare the 2008 recession for stocks, precious metals and crypto. I am curious to see how cryptos respond.

&#x200B;

. . . and yes 2022 very likely. I pray I am wrong. 

&#x200B;

JUST MY TWO CENTS.. This is not financial advice or anything of the nature. Just an APE's analysis.

Lumber prices higher, meaning cost to build higher, meaning higher housing prices, meaning people assuming more debt for the same home. I am seeing lenders being more tolerable to risk, and allowing these people that would be able to afford a 300k home borrow for a 450k home. This would remain stable if the work remains stable.

The issue: I am seeing people that are holding jobs that are rather temporary (Contract Labor) in the industrial arena. These same people that have been on these long term projects that are wrapping up. There does not seem to be more work following these projects in terms of work to continue gainful employment for these people in the same manner as it was. I am also seeing another side of the arena in regards to the oil fields and these workers. The new EO from our current administration has halted a lot of the mom-and-pop outfits that were employing these workers in the oil fields. Again, I do not see much flexibility in this work reopening. I am also seeing the religious congregations trying to lend a hand to the point of handing out free food boxes to help these families struggling.

Now I am not speaking ill things about any of these unlucky souls, but they do not have much of an education as means to finding better employment. I was one of the crowd at one point being I obtained a degree for a job that no longer existed in abundance. A majority of the same unfortunate ones do not have a great accumulation of savings from their income to be able say they will be able to effectively re-education process in a new field. REASON being they spent it on new vehicles, new houses, etc. I mean who can blame them - we all enjoy the better things in life where we can. Who honestly enjoys working on an older vehicle that is deeming itself as being unreliable due to use? Who honestly enjoys paying more for rent/lease than what a mortgage payment is?  Who honestly can say they do not like to have nice shirts, shoes, pants, etc to look nice? 

The only issue is when they assumed this debt and purchased these nice things - they assumed their income would remain stable. WELL . . . IT DOES NOT LOOK PROMISING - to say the least.  One can say they will unload the debt by selling their vehicles and houses - but what happens when they cannot unload the debt completely due to depreciation will create a snowballing effect.

I do think we will see a uptick in stocks as well in real estate arena. This is thanks to the increased revenues and asset values. I do think we will see a uptick in brick-and-mortar retail thanks to reopening. BUT I am questioning what will be the end result of this bubble effect. We all know what goes up - MUST COME DOWN. The question is when...

The OP raised the flag on inflation. Well the Fed operates on the assumption to counter inflation they must raise interest rates and reverse repos. I believe they reconvene in July? The government has a similar approach measure when it comes to Taxes. Which is already in discussion. The banks were ""begging"" for countermeasures to inflation. so - how will the fed and DC implement countermeasures?

I foresee a tax hike along with higher interest rates. When the Corporations and business with the money  to spend get charged more to proceed (Taxes and Interest,) they tend to hesitate and take their plans elsewhere, i.e. other countries/states. UNLESS it is subsidized with tax breaks and ""free"" money..

Which is in talks in DC now for infrastructure spending, etc... I pray it succeeds. This would put the labor force I mentioned prior back with means of gainful employment. BUT when have we known DC to act rationally in recent time. There is no guarantee they will be able to recover.

\*\*\*\*\*

I have included some links for verification to this thought and for others to start their due diligence. I am still trying to find the report from one of the various government entities I found with the 3.4 million people at least 30 days past due on their mortgage.

But research and looking at balance sheets and knowing what the numbers mean and keeping up with the news is all key. And, personally, I think that everyone should build up a good foundation of index ETFs (VT, VTI, RSP, whatever) before adding on individual stocks and definitely before starting into options at all. Whether you’re a gambler, a trader, or an investor a good stable foundation that represents at least 50% of your portfolio is going to make the whole thing much much easier. 

In my opinion. 

Blind faith in shit said on the internet is not the way though.

If you want a long entry on high tide you should be fine in the $7.50-9 range. The bought deal that just closed sold shares to institutional investors at a premium at $9.16. High tide is hard because it’s current valuation is stupid low so it might suddenly pop or keep trading sideways. If you get the chance to buy at $7.50 I wouldn’t hesitate the support there is very strong and has been retested for months. I would just watch and wait for the penny stock flippers to sell after the listing. Just yesterday was the perfect buy in price. Don’t fomo in an opportunity is bound to present its self.

I would also be prepared for the dilution debate that keeps persisting by uneducated investors. I won’t dive to deep but dilution is what has fueled high tides growth and the ceo is the largest shareholder, therefore it’s in his best interest to keep increasing shareholder value.

This thing is still live and hot. A lot of cynical people on here who act know better are going to look like fools once again (just like they did with GME). I could of sold for a profit today but didn't and will be loading up some more at the very beginning of next week. Bet you a lot of people who sold today are also coming back next week to push. This is just the beginning. It took a lot of dedicated people to get this far and you can bet your ass they will see this through if they haven't sold by now. Billions are at stake and those on the other side of this will try to discourage through all forms of manipulation over this long weekend. Chin up and stay the course.

8639,gzu33i3,2021-05-29,t3_nndcm2,wallstreetbets,"Fridays are at the mercy of the Options Gods. Options close out on Fridays. Weeklies close out every Friday, obviously, Monthlies close out mid-month. Market makers delta hedge the stocks, so as the underlying approaches the strike price the market makers  approach 100% fulfilment of the options. So for every option that's ITM or ATM, there are 100 shares owned by someone.

Thing is, most options contracts don't get exercised. They either expire worthless or get sold back to the market maker, and the shares assigned to fulfil them are then sold. This means that the higher the option activity on a given security, the more likely it is to dump on a given Friday. This was *really* obvious today. That movement in the second half of the day on a Friday is pretty predictable in that it will happen, but the extent is less certain. In general selling ahead to buy back on the dip isn't worth it - for one thing it's a wash sale so any losses don't count, and for another selling shares is a taxable event so you need to be pretty confident that the value will dump more than the value of the tax you would pay on your gains.

I've simplified this quite a lot, but the tl;dr is that if you still like the stock don't worry too much about drastic price changes in the second half of friday trading.",[],0

Whole Foods even today doesn't have anywhere close to RAD's revenue. So to build out the infrastructure of what RAD already has in place would take Amazon many many years and twice the money. Why when could buy the whole operations. Merge them with Amazon Pharmacy and still place them inside Whole Foods. Along with their existing location.

I HAD EDITED THE POST EARLIER THAT WAS EXPLAINING THE SAME STUFF JUST VERY OUT OF ORDER AND HARD TO UNDERSTAND  
If you guys will take possibly 5 minutes to read what's below you will have a great understanding of what is going to happen to AMC. ITS GOING TO BE FUCKING INSANITY  
You guys seriously don't know what's about to happen, this has been setup since the first squeeze in February and if you DON'T read what's below you WON'T know what to do with your stock. YOU WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY SEE 100% TO 500% GAINS POSSIBLY MORE  
Basically in February when AMC had its ""short squeeze"" the hedge funds were fucked, right, they bet billions of dollars on like a couple dollar per share shorts so when that went up to $10 to $15 to $20 per share, the hedge funds were fucked, right, they had to cover they're shorts and it would put them hundreds of billions in debt. however to cover a short you can either pay it off, or borrow more shorts form the brokerage, they lend out short shares that are expected to be paid back. usually a company has hundreds of millions of short shares available. so when it had that squeeze back in February the hedge funds had to cover their shorts which was billions of dollars, but, they didn't have to cover ALL of their shorts because AMC will MAKE hedge funds pay a fraction of the shorts that they owe (usually when the price reaches highs and brokerages get scared) and then let them borrow the rest. and that's what they did. they kept borrowing shares so that they didn't have to pay the hundreds of billions that they owe. however after the squeeze since the hedge funds still had most of their shorts to cover since they borrowed even more instead of paying them off, they were still trying to get the most out of debt possible, and to do that they had to keep shorting it. WELL MOTHERFUCKERS IT IS TIME. THEY HAVE JUST BEEN CONSTANTLY SHORTING IT FOR MONTHS. THERE ARE NO MORE SHORTS AVAILABLE TO BORROW. THE HEDGEFUNDS ARE HAVING TO PAY PAY BECAUSE LIKE I WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER YOU CAN EITHER PAY OR BORROW MORE AND THERE SIMPLY ISNT ANYMORE TO BORROW THEY HAVE TO FUCKING PAY THE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THEYVE BEEN PUTTING OFF FOR THE LAST 3 MONTHS. AND BETTER YET THE STOCK HAS TRIPLED THIS WEEK AND THE HEDGEFUNDS HAVE PAYED CLOSE TO 0% OF WHAT THEY OWE. THEY HAVENT EVEN STARTED TO PAY YET.

THEY'RE SCARED FOR YOU TO SEE THIS

FOR ALL OF YOU MOTHERFUCKERS IN AMC THIS IS FOR YOU  
If you guys will take possibly 5 minutes to read what's below you will have a great understanding of what is going to happen to AMC. ITS GOING TO BE FUCKING INSANITY  
You guys seriously don't know what's about to happen, this has been setup since the first squeeze in February and if you DON'T read what's below you WON'T know what to do with your stock. YOU WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY SEE 100% TO 500% GAINS POSSIBLY MORE  
Basically in February when AMC had its ""short squeeze"" the hedge funds were fucked, right, they bet billions of dollars on like a couple dollar per share shorts so when that went up to $10 to $15 to $20 per share, the hedge funds were fucked, right, they had to cover they're shorts and it would put them hundreds of billions in debt. however to cover a short you can either pay it off, or borrow more shorts form the brokerage, they lend out short shares that are expected to be paid back. usually a company has hundreds of millions of short shares available. so when it had that squeeze back in February the hedge funds had to cover their shorts which was billions of dollars, but, they didn't have to cover ALL of their shorts because AMC will MAKE hedge funds pay a fraction of the shorts that they owe (usually when the price reaches highs and brokerages get scared) and then let them borrow the rest. and that's what they did. they kept borrowing shares so that they didn't have to pay the hundreds of billions that they owe. however after the squeeze since the hedge funds still had most of their shorts to cover since they borrowed even more instead of paying them off, they were still trying to get the most out of debt possible, and to do that they had to keep shorting it. WELL MOTHERFUCKERS IT IS TIME. THEY HAVE JUST BEEN CONSTANTLY SHORTING IT FOR MONTHS. THERE ARE NO MORE SHORTS AVAILABLE TO BORROW. THE HEDGEFUNDS ARE HAVING TO PAY PAY BECAUSE LIKE I WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER YOU CAN EITHER PAY OR BORROW MORE AND THERE SIMPLY ISNT ANYMORE TO BORROW THEY HAVE TO FUCKING PAY THE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THEYVE BEEN PUTTING OFF FOR THE LAST 3 MONTHS. AND BETTER YET THE STOCK HAS TRIPLED THIS WEEK AND THE HEDGEFUNDS HAVE PAYED CLOSE TO 0% OF WHAT THEY OWE. THEY HAVENT EVEN STARTED TO PAY YET.

When they are reported it carries with it a requirement to deliver at a cost of 130% of the market price.  The count of FTD’s is cumulative and shows the number of FTD’s at that point in time.  So if the number is 1M on May 10th and then on May 15th the number is 250K, that means 750K were delivered between the two dates.   They are not additive.  Synthetics are absolutely legal in the options trading environment.  They are not legally allowed in a shareholders long position.   How do they get there?  I don’t see FTD’s as the instrument.

If anything this will only make the bear trap more dangerous.. The real party hasn't even started yet. You didn't see a massive sell-off AH. This thing is still live and hot. A lot of cynical people on here who act know better are going to look like fools once again (just like they did with GME). 

I could of sold for a profit today but didn't and will be loading up some more at the very beginning of next week. Bet you a lot of people who sold today are also coming back next week to push. This is just the beginning. It took a lot of dedicated people to get this far and you can bet your ass they will see this through if they haven't sold by now. Billions are at stake and those on the other side of this will try to discourage through all forms of manipulation over this long weekend. Chin up and stay the course.
