50,gysy5ty,2021-05-20,t1_gyqrw6s,algotrading,"You've said it: it's a complicated problem, but I think my preliminary results are pretty promising!  


So, in the past year I have been working on this with a 3 step approach:  


**1 - Reviewing the literature**

I've read a lot and reviewed a good part of the literature out there (started from Seyhun, Muzea, Cicero, Alldredge...) and came up with some of the key takeaways to define what I deem to be a ""significant transaction"" (i.e. when to buy in, filtering out the noise). Point is that academic literature is not interested in researching and developing a trading model, but rather to investigate the potential policy implications to spot and limit illicit insider trading transactions. As a side note, I can tell you the SEC is way more ahead in this compared to what EU authorities are doing.  


**2 - Tweaking the definition of ""significant purchase"" and populating the database**

Here's a point I really struggled with: I am not a quant and I have a limited experience in R. Somehow I managed to scrape all the data I needed from [http://openinsider.com/](http://openinsider.com/) and started to populate a database. After a while, I realized that the definition I previously came up with, was not so accurate. I can tell you some few things I now pay attention to in filtering out the noise:  
\- Don't focus on big companies (little price misallocation on average + compensation packages are more significant, meaning they don't buy in that often + I suspect ""insiders purchases"" policies are much stricter, but this is just a gut feeling)   
\- Disregard directors and 10% owners (e.g. funds) transactions: these are usually not significant. You want people that are dealing with the day-to-day business that know pretty well the sector they are operating in  
\- Pay attention to mixed signals, especially if  the owner of the company (CEO and 10% owner within the same person) is stubborn enough to buy in when everyone else is fire selling. Don't rely too much on the shares hold that are reported on EDGAR: it is not always accurate.  
\- Look at price patterns, insiders might eventually know better than anyone else what's the fair price of the company, but the market doesn't always reflect it in the short term. To put it differently, monitor the stock when there's a ""significant transaction"", but do not rush if the price is freefalling.   
Needless to say that these are just a very few details I pay attention to and that the list is not at all exhaustive. 

Anyway, after having scraped the data from openinsider I downloaded stocks' price from googlesheets and I am currently studying the price behaviour before and after what I define a ""significant transaction"". To give you few numbers: roughly 70% of the stocks I picked went up more than 10% in the 6-months period (even in years where S&P was flat) and the average time they took to reach it was roughly 40 days. Wait, not all that glitters is gold.  


**3 - Engineer and backtesting**  
Engineering the strategy is what is giving me headaches -  assuming my preliminary results are reliable. I don't know how many stocks I will be buying the next month, so how do I allocate my capital? When should I sell them? Should I start implementing some technical analysis? Which financial instrument should I use?

Finally, as you might guess I have been dedicating quite a considerable amount of time to it and I still have preliminary results, still something I would not be comfortable to trade on the basis of. Plus, I did not manage to backtest it properly: while I am an intermediate user of R (been using quantstrat and quantmod), I still find it hard to backtest a potential strategy through R. If anyone more expert is willing to join in on the project, that would be amazing!",[],0

80,gytgt8d,2021-05-20,t3_nguul3,algotrading,"SEC filings are in fact slightly delayed, in my research I often lag fundamental data to account for this. I just completed a research project where I used macroeconomic features from FRED. The monthly data is kept pretty up to date, though I think real time updates are probably a bit optimistic as economic releases are also sometimes delayed (think CPI, which usually has a 1 month delay). In terms of security data, Compustat has high integrity data that is regularly updated, and for this reason commonly used in my field, though again real time is tricky. As per an earlier comment, a market data provider, which won't be cheap, is likely required.

A question you should ask is do you really need real time updates? How often are you expecting to trade? If you are trading on fundamentals or macro data, those do not change daily so trading on them daily does not make sense. If you are expecting to buy and hold, for potentially more than a month or two, there may be cost effective ways of getting your data.",[],0

113,gyu753b,2021-05-20,t3_nguul3,algotrading,"Ok this is really big undertaking, something that has sucked up all my free time for last 5-6 years.

First you need to break the problem into two distinct phases. 1. Strategy development & Back Testing 2. Real deployment.

For the first part you can use Fred for Macroeconomic data & Yahoo finance for daily stock data. For fundamental data I would not recommend SEC because it’s a pain to work with and also even though there has been a lot standardization in recent years there is still too many variations in what each company reports and how they breaks downs their business. For fundamental I have been using SIPRO from AAII but also looked at intrinio and they seem to be pretty good too.

One additional thing that you’ll need to keep in mind is to get rid of the survivorship bias. Because if you only have the firms that survived till now then the system that buys shit companies probably will make a killing because they “survived” and you didn’t account for the ones that went kaput. Yahoo data won’t have any delisted companies, I use premium data and you can buy the delisted history from them. Additionally because ticker symbol tend to be reused and the companies change them all the time after mergers and things....you’ll need to create a mapping between the stock price data and fundamental data that is point in time. Using some fuzzy matching on name, industry and ticker I was able to solve the mapping for about 80% of delisted tickers.

On the infrastructure side I use python and for long time was using SQLite, one database file per ticker with tables for daily, 5 minutes and fundamental data. It made any cross-section analysis very hard, because I needed to read everything into python first. Last year I added historical Options data and at that point I moved to a 6 machine Citus Cluster (Postgres variant). The data is now split over 6 physical machines but looks like a single logical DB with ticker being the shard key. It’s an order of magnitude faster to both read and write.

Let me know if you need any further help, it’s a hard project.",[],0

Compustat/crsp rely on something called PERMNO, which is a company's permanent identification number, which takes care of changing names and tickers. Also the two databases never take out companies that are delisted unless for some reason you want them excluded (i.e. if you're studying bankruptcy the delisting for the wide variety of reasons outside of financial distress may not be useful).

Compustat/crsp also provide a wide range of fundamental data points, that get as detailed as you want (such as very specific line items on an income statement, just remember all companies have different income statements so there will be a lot of NaNs for more specific line items).

it's randomly generated hypothetical price fluctuations, but the point being that it doesn't seem like EMAs would provide any signals of future price fluctuations because if the price changes slope/trend/whatever the EMAs lag to the extent equal to their sensitivities; because price influences EMAs but not the other way around, I don't think they would reveal anything in terms of future price fluctuations. It was an exploratory analysis, and the gist I got from it was EMAs just look nice on a plot but don't serve much of a purpose. Maybe I'm wrong though.

This is a myth created by many blogs/news media. TQQQ is best to buy when there is a dip and hold until top. I do swing trades with TQQQ and SQQQ back and forth.

Like yesterday and today I bought SQQQ expecting some change in \^NDX few days.

In fact, I bought TQQQ on Mar 8th (avg $80) and sold after 12 days appx $108, a nice gain.

Theoretically, TQQQ can provide better returns than QQQ or SPY.

Just look at TQQQ price on Jan 2, 2020 (buy) and TQQQ Dec 31, 2020 (sell), you get 100% appreciation. In between, market corrected 30% during Feb-Mar 2020.

Another case, you may be amazed,  buy TQQQ on Jan 3rd, 2011 Monday and Sell it now. The appreciation simply exceeds Amzn or AAPL or MSFT buy on Jan 3rd, 2011 and sell it now. Check morningstar comparison for it.

Here is the chart I created few weeks back for 10 year comparison, TQQQ gave 6000%.

What are you talking about?  This is the description of TQQQ direct from ProShares' website ([link](https://www.proshares.com/funds/tqqq.html)).

>This leveraged ProShares ETF seeks a return that is 3x the return of its underlying benchmark (target) **for a single day**, as measured from one NAV calculation to the next. Due to the compounding of daily returns, holding periods of greater than one day can result in returns that are significantly different than the target return and ProShares' returns over periods other than one day will likely differ in amount and possibly direction from the target return for the same period. These effects may be more pronounced in funds with larger or inverse multiples and in funds with volatile benchmarks. Investors should monitor their holdings as frequently as daily. Investors should consult the prospectus for further details on the calculation of the returns and the risks associated with investing in this product.

> This leveraged ProShares ETF seeks a return that is 3x the return of its underlying benchmark (target) for a single day, as measured from one NAV calculation to the next. Due to the compounding of daily returns, holding periods of greater than one day can result in returns that are significantly different than the target return and ProShares' returns over periods other than one day will likely differ in amount and possibly direction from the target return for the same period. These effects may be more pronounced in funds with larger or inverse multiples and in funds with volatile benchmarks. Investors should monitor their holdings as frequently as daily. Investors should consult the prospectus for further details on the calculation of the returns and the risks associated with investing in this product.

Prospectus provides sufficient information to the investors, as per law. 

But, practically TQQQ gives better returns holding many years, except peak cycle (recession cycles..which someone identifies). 

Go to morning star, compare TQQQ returns vs AMZN, AAPL, MSFT...etc for last 5 years or 10 years holding. Except TSLA, no other company exceeds TQQQ returns. As I said already, people should avoid buying TQQQ when market is extreme peak (which causes recessionary period).

Yes I understood what you meant by large stop losses.  With a large stop loss, one would be betting on price recovering eventually, but your equity curve will go through large drawdown dips along the way.  These contribute to your MAE and will tank your Sharpe ratio. So a Sharpe above 2 does not translate to large stop losses. 

( MAE = maximum adversarial excursion. This refers to your unrealized loss ).

Again, no offense, but sometimes it is good to go back and revisit the things that we think we know. I have to do so almost every day, and I am better for it.

>  obviously the math is correct

And clarified that people interpret the math wrong. 

There's a negative sign in front of the (~strictly positive) volatility decay term. You can clearly see from the equation itself that this implies a downward-opening parabola on a risk-return plot for varying amounts of leverage (neglecting the risk of ruin and some other largely irrelevant details). But that merely implies there is an optimal amount of leverage, not that the optima is at 1x. 

The myth is that the levered fund will necessarily underperform on long time periods. As I stated, I can find any number of pop-finance articles which make that claim. That is, the myth is (implicitly) saying that the optimal amount of leverage is 1x, and shooting past it will necessarily decrease expected returns, as you will traverse down the right side of that parabola.

**But this is not the case.** The optimal leverage is often >1x. E.g. it is 3x for US equities since 1950. 

The truth is that volatility decay is exactly what also enables levered funds to *overperform* on long time periods, as the ""underleveraged"" (i.e. 1x) funds are not able to sufficiently capture the *upward* volatility.

Try to visualize as if you're teaching your strategy to a kid who knows nothing about markets and then break it down into intricate steps that dont rely on human intuition but pure cause and effect. Now simultaneously learn to code and how you can translate those basic human instructions into a computer instruction based on snippets of code.

This. OP's doing a credit spread options strategy, it honestly look far from 'extremely successful' under examination in that context.

The posted results are cut exactly between the start and end of the last decreasing volatility trend, and I mean exactly - literally the day after and the day before we had volatility spikes. This is the ideal regime where you make money with this approach.

If he didn't carefully crop the dates to make it look better, the results would likely be more typical where you see a **\~20%** gain per quarter as par for the course.

The problem with these strategies is that while you're making \~20% a quarter, around once a year you'll also completely wipe out your position out. You're basically gambling everything on avoiding price shocks with massive leverage. It's like playing Flappy Bird with perma-death.

Who knows though, it may have far better returns than normal. A strategy like this with a minimum **\~120% yearly return**, even with a yearly total wipe out of your position will still very slightly exceed the S&P 500. You just bet half your account on it at a time.

That's the thing with these approaches though. What's the wipe out rate, and long term return? Overall, given the generous time crop it really looks like OP is just getting the market rate of return with extra steps. You can't know until you test it over years though.",[],0

642,gz09fuw,2021-05-22,t3_ni1ww6,algotrading,"From everything I've read here, this seems pretty straightforward to implement, but here are few ""gotchas"" I'd be looking out for if I were you:

- Others are right about being wary of infrequent, but massively offsetting losses. I've experienced this personally and seen it happen to others with credit spread strategies. That being said, I hate the attitude on this sub of telling everyone ""too good to be true"" without a specific flaw to point out so if you think you've got something valuable, keep at it 
- Because of the above, your risk management is hugely important. It's always hugely important but strategies with expected high win rates can lull you into a false sense of success and bait you into being too aggressive 
- Backtesting this strategy accurately will be hard because historical options data is expensive and is understandably not feasible for many retail traders to invest in. There are workarounds but even a ""perfect"" backtest isn't as good as long-term, live trading results
- I don't know what kind of response you've gotten from others to collaborate but be selective when picking a partner. You want robust, user-friendly code, especially if you're not a developer yourself because the financial consequences of unforseen issues that you don't have the ability to fix on your own could be huge. This is especially true because Robinhood has no official API so if you're sticking with them, you have no official support. Be skeptical of anyone who's willing to take just your strategy as payment. There is a reason most freelance developers take payment in cash upfront and not a slice of profits for a ""totally killer app idea, bro""

That actually makes sense.  Futures trading happens in a clearing house separate from stock trading.  Under the hood brokers have to sweep funds from the brokerage account into the clearing house account.  Brokers tend to hide this behind the scenes from their users, but it can get a bit complicated.  Eg, say you have 100k in free margin in your stock account and you only do a small trade on /VIX or /BRR or similar (some sort of high volatility futures trade) and so your broker moves over, say, $500 extra into your commodities account under the hood.  Say something crazy happens and the futures you're holding spikes super crazy.  The clearing house will auto magin call you for not having enough in your account and it's rare (maybe impossible today) but your broker can not transfer funds over fast enough so you can get margin called, despite having 100k of free margin.

Anyways, long tangent aside, because it's two different accounts with two different balances under the hood, features like OCO are possible, but it's very hard on the broker so many opt out of more advanced features like that.  Usually how it works is you'll have OCO but for stock only and futures are not applicable.  That's how, eg, Tastyworks does it.  They have features that do not get disabled, but if you try to do it on futures it fails.",[],0

Some of these can be developed to a point where they could be reused and metatrader has a marketplace where people can share their ""bots"" which are called expert advisors. Some are free some are paid for. 

With any bot or code that's not your own I'd say you risk it not working as expected. Also given how changeable markets can be bots performances can be mixed and go from doing well to not doing well. In my opinion (take with a pinch of salt cause I am 100% no expert) bots need to be maintained, updated or scrapped over time.

My conclusions were that it doesn't really seem like EMAs would reveal any predictive information about future price fluctuations because prices influence EMAs but not the other way around, thus anytime the price dramatically changes course, the EMAs lag behind in proportion to the size of their moving windows or number of samples or the method for calculating alpha or however your EMAs are calculated differently, and even the most sensitive EMAs (i.e. the shorter EMAs or the EMAs with smaller windows or samples or whatever) would still follow the actual price at a delay; even the crossing of EMAs or the whether they are above or below the actual price doesn't really seem to reveal anything in terms of predicting future price fluctuations.
