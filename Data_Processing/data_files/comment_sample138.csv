5,gz4a4qu,2021-05-23,t3_nhnzq9,investing,"How is it possible that a company's TTM free cash flow is consistently less than its current liabilities, but never requires financing? For example, consider CoreCivic Inc. (CXW).Take a look at their annual free cash flow at the bottom of this page:https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/cxw/financials/cash-flowNow compare that to their annual current liabilities on this page:https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CXW/corecivic/balance-sheetEach year since 2017, free cash flow has been less than current liabilities -- not by much, but still less. In other words, the company isn't generating enough cash to pay off its liabilities in time. But if you go back to the cash flow statement and look at net financing cash flow, you see a significant outflow of cash every year. So the company is not only not borrowing money, it's actually paying off lots of debt and buying back stock. Where is this money coming from? How are they meeting their liabilities?",[],0

Then, when the stock starts to go down you can add more shares at a discount.  It's kind of a similar concept to the Weakest Link gameshow strategy where the contestants ""bank"" their money after they have performed well by answering questions and earning additional money.

The market events causing the stock to go down that much, would be market events putting the dividends in jeopardy.

I would also be too afraid to miss the rebound in growth stocks., by putting my money in value stocks that likely had a weaker drop and a more moderate rebound. Of course, I keep these stocks in my portfolio, because I believe they won't go down as far before something bad happens.

I have some T, AT&T. It has a near monopoly on several utility services many consumers rely on on an expansive network. They can take a small hit in a major market event, but they will maintain revenue better than others. Right now their dividend is just below 7%. Long-term they're going to have problems, they're at risk to losing parts of their business to technology innovation, but they're going to bring in a great deal of revenue over time as it happens.

Of course, in 2008 T didn't fall near as hard from the peak as the overall S&P 500 did, which is the problem with selling assets and buying T and missing the rebound. The S&P 500 rebound after 2008 was much stronger than what T experienced.

My defensive play would be to hold money in defensive stocks constantly still giving me something before the bad times and after a major crash reinvest it into something that will rebound at a higher rate. To me it is a risk hedge in my portfolio for the bad times.",[],0

This is a retirement account that has certain tax advantages (Taxes that you will pay the government). It will allow you to invest and grow your money and when you reach the age of around 65 you can start using this money for retirement. 

With a Roth IRA, you contribute after-tax dollars, your money grows tax-free, and you can generally make tax- and penalty-free withdrawals after age 59½. With a Traditional IRA, you contribute pre- or after-tax dollars, your money grows tax-deferred, and withdrawals are taxed as current income after age 59½. 

Some other options are a 401k. A 401k is an employer-sponsored retirement account. It allows an employee to dedicate a percentage of their pre-tax salary to a retirement account. 

These funds are invested in a range of things like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and cash.

IMO there's alpha to be made in the market which is why a global firm like T Rowe has an edge. No offense to any locals there...but it seems that in aggregate Hong Kong investors are pretty easy to exploit. In general you'll see lots of performance and bubble chasing.

The only thing moving the stock price is buyers and sellers, that is it, and of course options as well as short sales etc. it’s really just a game to buy as Low as possible and ride the high and sell high leaving the rest as bag holders, because when you sell high someone has to buy that and they are the ones who lose. But why does good news need to make a stock go up or bad news make people panic sell. It’s not like you actually own a piece of the company nor do you care how the company is actually doing. A day trader also isn’t gonna be flipping stocks that pay dividends often or anything so really it’s just a game where you can gain an edge using TA. So once again why the hell does any news matter??

And investing in a company like XOM makes it worse due to the decades of misinformation, climate change denial, and politicking that the company is responsible for that has undoubtedly worsened the climate crisis. 

I also agree that the world can be harsh and that entertainment is necessary - but cigarettes are a source of relief for people insomuch as the big tobacco industry has created, developed, and propagated an addictive product and strategically embedded itself in cultures around the world to convince people that they're necessary. I will argue that cigarettes are simply bad, full stop, and the world would be a better place without them. 

So taking a step back from discussing the necessity of these companies and products, my original question is about our investment agency more than the existence of the companies: At what point do we as investors disqualify investment in these companies based on the morality of their business regardless of how stellar their divs might be?

My argument is that we shouldn't invest in tobacco or oil companies as a proxy of collective demand that (a) tobacco companies go bankrupt or shut down such that we move on from a world with addictive, cancer-causing tobacco products and (b) oil companies invest their profits in renewable infrastructure, cleaning up the messes they've made in the environment, and decarbonize/divest from continued oil infrastructure development.

198,gz4ues9,2021-05-23,t1_gz4hy50,investing,"Take a step back and ignore the short-term volatility. Let's look at the very long run. And let's look at a very small example, that we can easily make sense of. 

Lets say I own an ice cream shop. It's in a pretty hot region, near a landmark, and it's in a good spot. The shop nets $100,000 in profit, and business is pretty stable year-to-year. I want to sell my business. What's it worth to you? Well, you're going to do some calculation or another, but the calculation will mostly focus around that $100,000 profit per year, because your goal is to make a profit. The yearly profit will determine your payback period, the net present value of the future cash flows, etc. You come up with a number. If I issue 1,000 shares, each share is worth 0.1% of the valuation you came up with.

Now let's say some big news came out. A local politician just decided the landmark next to my business is very culturally relevant, and the government is going to issue grants to bring school children from around the state to this landmark on field trips every year. The legislature just voted on this 10-year grant and it passed. I'm expecting my customers to grow by 50%, and my profits to double. Guess what? You better revisit your previous calculation, because my business is now a lot more profitable. It's not more valuable BECAUSE of the news, so to speak, but everyone now KNOWS it's more valuable, because they have this added information about the future. Therefore, people are now willing to pay more for my business, because the calculation from the previous paragraph is adjusted.

Maybe then news comes out that global warming is accelerating and the hotter summers are going to increase my sales. Or maybe news comes out that the building next door to me is being torn down and a competitor is opening up a ice cream shop. That's going to hurt my margins, which hurts my expected future profits. As soon as the new information becomes available (ie ""news""), everyone readjusts their expected future profit of my business, which changes how much they're willing to pay for it. 

The same applies to publicly traded companies. With stocks, you are benefiting from the future profits because of dividends. Even without dividends, you also benefit from reinvestment in the business because you own a share of those assets. For example, if my ice cream shop had $100,000 in the cash register, and a $500,000 building, it would be worth more than an equivalent shop with no cash and only a $200,000 building. Therefore, as a business builds up its assets (and its profit-making potential) it becomes more valuable. So even if the shop doesn't pay a dividend, as it continues to grow larger, your share grows in value. 

Lastly, lets address the concept of people being ""bag holders"". Just because someone buys a stock from you that you purchased cheaper, doesn't make them a bag holder. A lot of companies have been around for decades, and continue to grow and profit. Many people have bought and later sold them and made money in the process (and collected dividends). As long as the business continues to profit (and/or grow), it can keep becoming more valuable and keep providing benefit to owners. Unlike a ponzi scheme, stocks don't have a limit on their growth. It's not a zero-sum game. Sure some people ""lose"" by timing things very wrong, but overall, in the long term, the large majority are winners. It's not a 50/50 split, there are significantly more winners.

So, who are the ""bag holders""? Really, the bag holders are the ones who overpay for a stock, expecting future profits, and then those profits don't actually materialize, and the business declines in value because people aren't willing to pay as much if it's not going to earn as much money for them. So how does one prevent from overpaying? Well, one important factor is in making sure to adjust their valuation based on all relevant information. When the news hits that a competitor is moving in next door to the ice cream shop, you should quickly downgrade the amount you'd be willing to pay for the shop, or else you risk paying for large profit margins that everyone else now knows won't exist, due to the competition. That seems natural. It's also called ""reacting to news"".

Of course a lot of day-to-day news is white noise, short-term, CNBC filler material. But, signifant news does significantly impact price, and for good reason.",[],0
199,gz4ufbm,2021-05-23,t1_gz4knxe,investing,"No. I recently had a similar conversation with someone that was basically saying, anyone who owns a total market fund own those stocks too.

If investing in a tobacco company is morally wrong to you, then don't invest in a total market fund either. If you can live with it, then why not have dividends too?",[],1
200,gz4ufwd,2021-05-23,t1_gz4k6p6,investing,"Part of a value investing strategy is to be in value before the crash and not take as big of a hit as having been all growth. Take advantage of that stability.

If I can vaguely use NASDAQ as a proxy variable for being more growth focused and DJI being more value focused, which is admittedly imperfect and not without some merit, you can look at how they performed in the '70s.

Going into the recession, the NASDAQ took deeper losses initially that would take them longer to recover from. Once the market bottomed out in late '74, DJI out-competed the NASADAQ for about 1.5 years, then the NASDAQ greatly out-competed DJI well into the '80s.

A play that has investments in DJI before that crash, that would switch to the NASDAQ after the rebound takes shape would out-compete staying the course with one or the other.

If you had cash on the sidelines once the market started rebounding, the DJI would've been best for a short time... then NASDAQ was better for far longer.

Basically a more stable, dividend generating company that can keep more of their sales during downturns won't fall as much initially. It didn't fall 60%

So I wouldn't have become a strictly value investor for a decade. I'd maintain a typical balanced portfolio and learn how to adjust in certain conditions to your advantage.

207,gz4v2jj,2021-05-23,t3_nittdv,investing,"Trailing stops are a really bad idea in crypto. The market will almost always shake you out of your position right before it takes off. A better option is to set multiple take profit orders on the way up. eg. at every 20% increase, sell 20% of what you have left. This will halve your profits vs. perfectly timing the peak, but the odds of you doing that are way less than 50% anyway, so it makes sense.

I had a pleasant surprise with take profit orders on the stock market recently. It's a bit different in crypto because the market is open 24/7, but it still shows the nature of a take profit order.

I had a take profit set for $4.20. The market closed at $4.10 and then there was some overnight news. In premarket the next day it shot up to $4.80. When market opened, my shares sold for $4.80 - not the $4.20 I had specified. Because a take profit order means ""sell to the highest bidder after the sell price rises above x"" A stop loss by contrast is ""sell to the highest bidder after the sell price drops below x"" So, when you get shaken out, even if your rolling stop is 10% above previous high, if there's an extreme event (which are not uncommon) your trailing stop loss can shake you out for somewhat less than the 10% below the high, because you may well be taking best offers in a rapidly falling market.",[],1

You are heavily focused on the day-to-day price fluctuations. So if the value of the company is based on the long-term, why does the short term matter? Well, let's say we found out the next 5 summers were all going to be cold and rainy? That would really tank the value of my ice cream shop, right? Maybe 50%? But we don't forecast that far out. Let's say we found out an El Nino event was going to make for one bad year. That might cut say 10% from my shop. But let's say we're far out, and the likelihood of El Nino is only 50%, so it only dropped my value 5%. Then say we get a little closer to summer and the forecast gets a little more certain and we get 60% chance of El Nino. So my business drops another 1%. So that 1% weekly shift in value was just due to a slight adjustment in the long-term expectations. The markets are constantly trying to refine those expectations for the future. And as they fluctuate, you will see volatility.

Short-term news can also have an effect. If a heat wave is headed towards my shop, maybe my value with tick up a hair to account for all the extra profits I'll make in those two weeks. Irrelevant in the long run? Yes. But a 1% change is also irrelevant in the long run, so it's on the right scale. Say miraculously heat wave after heat wave hits, and my value ticks up a hair each week, week after week. By the time summer is over, I've increased the value of my business 10%, and the price has steadily been climbing, at 0.3% per week, as the good news kept rolling in. So as small changes to outlook occur, so do small changes in the price occur.

Because investors are human, you also get irrational behavior, like exuberance, or fear, which can play a role. However, keep in mind that ""exuberance"" means excitement for future profit. And ""fear"" means fear of not having future profits. So investors are still reacting to the value of the business, as best they are able. And sure, you can get some speculative games. Let's say I think Tesla sucks, but I anticipate lots of less savvy investors will be tricked into thinking Tesla is great based on the next earnings report. Maybe I'll buy in to try to ride that wave up, and get out before it crashes? Certainly a dangerous game, but some people may play that game.

Another human factor (sort of) is how much cash investors have sitting around to invest. Mail everyone stimulus checks and lock them down so they can't go out and spend it, and guess what?

What I've been looking at doing was finding a cheap crypto (less than a penny if I can get it) so I could buy more. Sia something looked promising. But I was debating putting a decent chunk in to try to double my money.

1 cent to 2 cents I feel should be possible within a month. But back in April it briefly went to 6 cents, and that even better.  

I know there's risk, so I'll probably start with $100-200 max to see how things work out.

I think a counterargument would be that the collective demand of consumers has voted on many of these things, and at least some investors are simply choosing to embrace trends that they have no personal control over.

For example, the move to SUVs is basically erasing all emissions gains from small cars and electrification, [based on energy predictions from the IEA](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/14/suvs-will-ensure-oil-demand-grows-for-decades-warns-iea). I have no interest in them and think they have made driving worse; but I have no control over the mass of consumers. Consumers are literally voting with their dollars for a *more* carbon-intensive lifestyle. At some point people are just going to say ""if you can't beat them, make money off them"" (which sounds like something from the Ferengi rules of acquisition).

One interesting take I saw on Bloomberg a few months ago was that XOM was facing a confluence of problems (IIRC, can't find it again - I think it was a Kara Swisher piece) from declining refining profits, shareholder demands to maintain the dividend, and pressure to move to renewables (but no money to do so effectively).

At the most general level, you make money on stock in two ways: 1) Dividend and 2) the price of the stock share increasing in the stock market.

The dividend is a cash payment to the stock holder. They are usually issued monthly, quarterly, or yearly. The dividend percent list is the total annual amount. In this case it is 6.93%. That means they are going to give shareholders 6.93% the value of the share of the stock during the year.

That is quite high. Typically it is closer to 0.5-3%.

The value of the share of stock can decrease or increase over time, regardless of the dividend.

Most growth stocks don't issue dividends. They are usually growing their business and put the cash into growing their operations. It is more common with value stocks. They are usually established companies with less room to grow, but they have a profitable business. Their stock prices might not go up as quickly, but they can issue dividends to the shareholders from their profits. Some people choose to reinvest dividends back in the same stock, so the amount people have invested in the stock grows. 

One warning, because most brokerages prominently report unrealized gains on the stock price, it is not showing gains you've made on dividends there and if you reinvest dividends it can make your unrealized gains percent be diluted from your original investment. The new reinvestments haven't had time to change in value and are averaged into the percentage.

This is because the underlying value of the companies didn't significantly change, but the value of the currency they were denominated in did.

""And even with Neves’ recent spate of acquisitions, Farfetch’s strongest selling point has always been its marketplace-style platform. The retailer enlists boutiques around the world to list their stock on Farfetch; in exchange for a base of 25% made from sales, they receive much greater exposure than they could hope to achieve on their own. For customers, this means nearly unfettered access to hundreds of different stores at once. The approach allows Farfetch to take on zero of the risk that comes with stocking its own products while culling sizable percentages of every purchase made on their site. “[The format] helps give you the benefit of having a super broad assortment without Farfetch having to take risk,” Yurma says.

Throughout the pandemic, Farfetch has been able to play hero for some of the boutiques on its network. “In many cases for these boutiques, and some of the small brands, we were the vast majority of their business if not the only source of business for a period of time,” Neves says. That’s true for folks like Marta De Megni, the owner of 519, a high-end shop in Verona, Italy that sells Rick Owens and Ann Demeulemeester. “In this special moment, being in Farfetch has been a blessing for me,” she says. 519 doesn’t have its own website—when you click the shopping buttons on the store’s online home, you’re redirected to the shop’s Farfetch page—and De Megni relays that the core of her business comes from her physical store. Farfetch helps offset that. “It helps me to sell every day and to be sure that my business can still be alive even if people coming into the shop are less than before,” she says."" (https://www.gq.com/story/farfetch-future-of-shopping)

As discussed in that article, the company has been making purchases and will likely continue to add other layers to the site - they've discussed going into beauty recently. In 2019, they bought New Guards Group (including a partnership with famed brand Off-White) and the infrastructure that came with that:

""De Giglio describes NGG as a one-stop shop that is able to connect its umbrella of brands to manufacturers, producers, embroiders, zipper providers, scent laboratories, or even marketing firms. NGG realized early on that the future of fashion was built on instantaneous rewards. The same emotional gotta-have-it-rn response that See Now, Buy Now (RIP) and the Zaras of the world are predicated on. De Giglio says the systems he’s put in place makes it possible to produce high-end T-shirts, sneakers, and leather goods in just three—three!—weeks. “It’s like luxury fast-fashion,” he told BoF. The process that makes luxury fast-fashion possible is grueling: four shifts of factory workers keep manufacturers humming 24 hours a day seven days a week. Some of these companies will also deliver product overnight.

Farfetch then is porting over the process that makes it possible for Off-White to play in the fast-paced age of Instagram. Soon, Farfetch will be able to create its own brands using this same system.""

Additionally, Farfetch has been working on offline, as well with the ""Store of the Future"" platform: https://www.voguebusiness.com/consumers/inside-the-new-browns-london-flagship-farfetch-store-of-the-future

Comparisons are made to Netflix in the articles above and in ways that's accurate: Netflix was an aggregator of other people's content and eventually used that platform to deliver more and more of their own. Farfetch will likely mostly continue to be primarily a luxury fashion tech platform (and luxury fashion being a segment where a lot of sales are still done offline) with selective purchases (like sneaker/streetwear seller Stadium Goods) that gradually continue to build out its own brand relevance in fashion. 

There was also the Alibaba/Richemont partnership last year where both made a significant investment: https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-farfetch-investment-alibaba-idUKKBN27L2Z7

It's not a huge holding but Farfetch is something that stuck around after the selling of a lot of the aggressive growth names in my portfolio in the second half of last year and early this year.

That's also not universally correct, see for example Nano or Iota.

Also, yeah ALL currencies, not just crypto need a way of handling the settlement of transactions and distribution of currencies which needs energy and costs fees.  
In theory it's true a centralized solution can be more efficient, although in practice the existing solutions often aren't that efficient because banks don't operate purely digitally nor are they optimized for efficiency or cost.  
So in practice the most energy-efficient cryptos are about as or more efficient than Visa.

It's true that cryptos tend to encounter some problems as they grow, but that's true for any new technology.

Historically, as the global reserve currency, USD has been long-term one of the currencies that has [best kept its value](http://www.miketodd.net/encyc/dollhist.htm) over the long term relative to others. IIRC the last time I looked into this, only CHF had done better, and it wasn't much in the difference.

So ultimately what you are taking on is the inherent risk in investing in equities. And you diversify away from the US-specific risk by investing in a world fund.

Not the half that isn't US. The half that isn't US, their stock prices will bounce around in their local currencies and will be converted back into the currency the fund is denominated in (typically USD).

If you have something like VT (or the EU UCITS equivalent), it is going to hold for example Maersk, which is listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen in DKK.

Maersk's price is going to bounce around in DKK, but the fund will convert this to USD at the day's exchange rate to calculate its NAV.

If you have 1,000 shares of Maersk, they are worth ~17m DKK which is $2.78m today.

If a USD-denominated ETF holds 1,000 shares of Maersk, they are worth $2.78m.

If you continue to hold those 1,000 shares of Maersk, they are worth whatever they are worth in five years, in DKK.

If the USD-denominated ETF continues to hold those 1,000 shares of Maersk, what are they worth in five years? Exactly the same, because they are the same thing, that the fund is denominated in USD makes zero difference.",[],1

There is not a maximum % that they increase rent, but they have to be competitive.

402,gz5hhcn,2021-05-23,t1_gz4hy50,investing,"I'm surprised no one answered, go ask in an advice thread I guess, but my own answer:

The market ""prices in"" events. That happens all the time and they often start pricing in an event long before you or I even imagine the event. The difference is that they don't just say, hey in the next 5 years, there's a 100% chance of a merger between boost mobile and Sprint. No, they say it's a 23.62% chance that a deal happens next year, 12% chance 2 years from now, 30% chance it gets blocked, etc. 

Then those percent chances are reworked as more news becomes available. Headline: ""they're in talks"" triggers the 12% 2 year shifting to the one year column, so it's now ~40% chance of a deal this year. So maybe the price jumps a bit that day. And say the deal would Bring the stock price from $20->$30, well on that day, it might have already been $22, and then with the news it would jump to $24/25. That way, when the final deal does, or does not happen, they are basically halfway between the two outcomes. 

Mathematically, this is how the news is supposed to affect stock prices, and sometimes does. But most times, corporate finance doesn't get the percentages right, ignores a lot of different kinds of outcomes due to unimaginative predictors, think they may have heard an inside tip, might be distracted by Covid, or by politics. Etc. 

This is why small cap companies can be mispriced more often than large cap, because it's often not worth the money and time to research the company well. And with more money in passive investing, that gives active funds less total funds to justify in each individual stock holding, further compounding the issue. But, computers are a force multiplier, so that helps one predictor get more done, but again one predictor will have biases, so it's a small offset.

It has $160B+ in debt and just sold their media division. HBO max is a bust (I’m a consumer but it can’t compete). 5G is going to be stupid expensive and they’ll do anything they can to compete with T-Mobile and Verizon…which for T means they’ll just take on more debt at the expense of the shareholders while continuing to pay their CEO 300x their average worker.

If you use the current exchange rate, the price will be the same on both the USD and EUR denominated stock exchange. Suppose you buy 1 share and wait a few years. If you then want to sell, the price on both exchanges will again be identical when taking the exchange rate into account. 

Did it matter in which currency you invested? Not at all! The prices on all exchanges are related 1 to 1 by the exchange rate.

Regarding my personal situation: I've consistently beaten the S&P 500 index CAGR since at least 2009.  However, I'm a very different situation because of my background in finance and the amount of capital I have.  It takes me very little effort to find massively undervalued securities in otherwise solid companies, even in the current market.

There's a volume of professional expertise and years of professor-led instruction that you can't substitute with going down the same checklist 5, 10, or 5000 times.

Gas stations were out of gas by day 2 (the ones who were still operational with generators). Some looting, but that was crushed quickly by law enforcement. If you did not have a physical means to transact, you were out of luck for a week. I'm not saying this is where gold or silver would come in at all, but this is where having physical cash is important (if you hoard physical goal and silver, you should always have physical cash as well despite the 2 asset classes seemingly being in conflict with each other).

Summer 2020 race riots. Law enforcement told township residents that there may be stretches of time during that one day/night where it was the worst, where police may be unable to respond in a timely manner or respond at all. The department advised everyone stay indoors with the doors locked, and have a plan to defend themselves if need be. Half of the police force was sent to a neighboring town where rioters were attempting to loot and burn down a new mall, a Walmart, and Home Depot. Police had created a thin ""hold the line"" perimeter against the rioters and it was barely working. Rioters managed to set a portion of the mall on fire, you could see the smoke from my house. Rioters began to wander to the neighboring towns with thinned out police forces. I could hear rioter gun shots popping off in the distance throughout the night (I decided to stay up all night to protect my family). They attempted to loot a 7-Eleven 5 mins away but the 2 owners had already positioned themselves behind the counters with an AR-15 and Mini-14 drawn at the front, yelling at the rioters to not come in meanwhile the crowd kept getting larger and larger. Repeated calls to 911 to get police over were unsuccessful. The rioters broke 1 window and then when they saw what they were up against they left and looted further down the road. Adjacent township there was an attempted murder of a police officer, a borderline ambush set up by a rioter(s). They caught one of them.

The former didn't end up being as bad as other regions (NYC had a breakdown with looting in many pockets but then again they were hit much harder than we were), but the latter event above was truly an eye opener of how quickly the whole system can break down.

Definitely don't think it's a fraud, it's just a very aggressive growth fund that never dials their bullishness on hyper growth down at all. She sells big, high quality into downturns and builds up more into smaller, more speculative positions where she already owns 10%+ of the company.  As long as growth bounces, great. If there was a more sustained downturn in growth, might be problematic. There's already been some minor selling of concentrated positions lately (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-22/cathie-wood-is-trimming-her-biggest-stakes-as-ark-funds-stumble)

The one thing that I do think helps them is that I do think that there is a generation of investors who is interested in investing in what they are excited about for the future and I don't think any fund sort of is the face of that more than Ark - which has been helped by their marketing. The funds are down a lot but there really has been very little AUM outflow - still a net inflow YTD. If growth continues to fare like it has lately there may be outflows in the months ahead but  I really do think that a lot of younger people invest primarily in themes they're excited about and if growth underperforms a lot of them will probably stick with the growth playbook rather than try to adjust.",[],1

Stock brokers don't like this because they make money on trades, not investments.  It's boring.  The gains take a long time to be realized.  

I ran some projections on dividend spreadsheets for my 401k, and it was around 15-20 years that the dividends would start to out pace my yearly contributions.  After that, however, they took off.

You can realistically find a 5-7% return on a dividend portfolio and still maintaining a diverse spectrum of exposure.

I will make the bold assumption that you're living in America. From the terms I see in the comment, it feels like you're coming at it at a very academic angle, like betting on the bounce back or something.

Geo-political risk here is at an *ACCELERATION* point. Hong Kong news right now is ridiculous. Let me give you 2 examples. 1. Chief of secret police in Hong Kong was suspended on prostitution charges (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Choi#Career, see the references) 2. Mayor of the city is announcing that a civil servant exchange program with mainland. (https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3133100/hong-kong-send-more-civil-servants-across-border-greater, SCMP is subtly pro-china media btw)

People in local forums are so into American markets now, a lot of people my age have given up on local stocks; and even the city itself?

Answering your question: How long is that drag gonna last? Hong Kong is seeing a wave of mass exodus. People are withdrawing their pension money because they are actually at the working ages but fleeing the city. Again, people my age are constantly talking about emigrating. Capital is leaving the city, not coming in. How will equities here produce good returns in the long run?

Stocks did go up briefly earlier, but it's slowly falling back down. I think it's pretty clear that the brief surge was to BUY UP local conglomerates like HSBC (at a loss), as a political move, so to obtain a substantial majority in key industries, to further silence employees in the future.",[],0

To your point about the price dropping after dividend payment, but my understanding is that typically this cycle plays out for dividend paying stocks:

1) Stocks rises prior to strike date to ""true"" value level as everyone tries to get in on the dividend payment
2) Strike date elapses, and money rushes out as the ""dividend is already secured""
3) Over the course of the next dividend cycle, stock price will rise back up as dovetail with Point #1 and reset the cycle

Growth stocks are generally considered less-risky than value stocks. Companies do not set a dividend %; they set the payout amount and the yield is determined by the stock price. 

The dividend on stocks like T are high because the market is pricing in their lack of growth. Generally, value stocks are considered riskier because companies that are growing (growth stocks) are in a better position and may outcompete them.

The main risk of growth stocks is when the market prices-in too much growth.

One great example of this is Apple. A few years ago, the market did not have a lot of growth priced-in and it was trading at 12 P/E because the pivot to services was much greater than expected.

Not accurate...

From July 1984 to now, T share price is up **505%**.  A $10,000 investment would be worth $50,500. Alone over 37 years not great, but dividends do matter...especially for value oriented stocks.

Using a dividend reinvestment calculator, a $10,000 purchase in July 1984 would be worth $1,399,977,44 today, if left alone.

So you end up with 140x your original investment. It is an annualized return rate of 14.5%

Now in the last 10-20 years, results haven't been so good. Anyone who initially bought in between '98 or '01 made a bad investment. After that, it is still been getting annualized returns near 7%, if you reinvest the dividend.

T has some real challenges ahead. They are getting extra competition and needing to adjust to technological innovation affecting some lines of their business. But they can't be short-changed that badly...

You're using a split stock chart incorrectly. The reason the raw price of the share drops when it is split, is they issue the shareholders 2x or 3x the stock depending on the split.
