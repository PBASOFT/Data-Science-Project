They'd essentially make a prescription drug that you wouldnt get high from, and didnt need a clinic for. It would target inflammation in a specific gene in your body that would then treat the bodily aspect of whats causing your depression.

-Gross margin of 37% in Q1 2021, compared with 33% in Q4 2020
-Cash and cash equivalents of $12.4 million as of March 31, 2021
-Strong brand performance, with approximately 747,927 Branded Units sold in Q1 2021 (a 44% increase over Q1 2020)

-Revenue for Q1 2021 was $9.9 million, compared with $4.7 million in Q1 2020 and $9.7 million in Q4 2020. The primary driver of growth was strong demand in the Company's core markets of Colorado and Oregon as well as the consolidation of wholesale revenue. Similar strength in the Company's emerging markets also contributed to growth, as did the successful launch of new products including Lunchbox Alchemy CBD.

-Gross profit of $3.71 million (37% gross margin) in Q1 2021, compared with $2.85 million (61% gross margin) in Q1 2020 and $3.16 million (33% gross margin) in Q4 2020. In 2020 sales were primarily comprised of licensing and packaging revenue. This represented lower topline revenue but higher gross margin percentages, with lower gross profit dollars. With the consolidation of our operations in our core markets2 we are now generating higher topline revenue with lower gross margin percentages and higher gross profit dollars. The increase in margin from Q4 2020 is a result of fully consolidating the economics of our Colorado manufacturing partner from December 31, 2020.

-Adjusted EBITDA (LBITDA) of ($0.96 million) in Q1 2021, compared with ($2.7 million) in Q1 2020. The reduction of the Adjusted EBITDA loss is primarily attributable to an increase in revenue and a reduction in operating expenses. The increase in revenue in Q1 2021 of $5.23M which represents a 112% increase can be attributed to the Company's consolidation of its core market operations as described above.

-$12.4 million of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2021, compared to $6.5 million at December 31, 2020. This includes proceeds from an oversubscribed private placement (the ""Financing"") for aggregate gross proceeds of $11.9 million, led by cannabis-focused private equity firm Merida Capital Holdings.",[],0

298,gzmyee5,2021-05-27,t3_nm51cw,pennystocks,"Full report here and I just placed a DTC alcohol order with SPONF!

Just Placed a DTC Alcohol Order for SponsorsOne (SPONF) Doc Wyler’s Infused Lemonade  
   
Good day everyone,  
   
SponsorsOne Inc. (OTC: SPONF), (CSE: SPO) a company that works with brands to build and manage communities of influencers within the social realm, a DTC distributor of alcoholic beverages, and a developer of hemp cigarettes.  
   
Current price     $.031/share  
   
SPONF has been a development stage company but is now selling a product. The company shares may be looked at differently once the company reports revenues. The last available financial report is from the period ended 12-31-20, so new financials could come anytime.  
   
SPONF has already taken purchase orders for Doc Wyler’s Infused Lemonade. As they build the Doc Wyler’s distribution network, the purchase orders keep coming and, you can buy Doc Wyler’s Lemonades online. We know you can buy online because we did. We bought the Tequila Infused Margarita Lemonade.  
   
Doc Wyler’s is available on the Great American Craft Spirits Website. The transaction was smooth and easy but there were fees for adult verification and shipping. The fees were not unlike you would pay for Doordash or Uber Eats (except for the adult verification fee), but our Doc Wyler’s order is coming right to our door.  
   
The company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, HS Brands, Inc., to develop and distribute hemp cigarettes. On March 30, 2021, SPONF secured a five-year purchase and manufacturing supply agreement with a six-generation tobacco cultivation and processing company for their pre-rolled hemp cigarettes. The absence of nicotine and the additives found in tobacco cigarettes could be a deterrent to smoking.  
   
The SponsorsCloudTM platform and associated applications & products continue to be developed towards commercial readiness   The on-going maturation of the social media market is creating many opportunities for new ways to leverage social media and build value utilizing social media. Also, the convergence of social media and digital media is a trend that is creating much opportunity. SPONF is strategically positioned directly within this convergence.  
   
The company has the three verticals mentioned above as potential streams of revenue. As we said earlier, SPONF shares gained to $.11/share just on the announcement of entering the DTC alcohol sector. What do YOU think could happen when they start to report revenues?

My outlook has only improved. They actually turned PROFITABLE in Q1. Net profitable. That's extremely rare in the world of OTC. Their debt is nearly paid off and they're very cash flow positive.   


They're the biggest steal in all of OTC at the current price. It is absurd. They had to enter a ""quiet period"" (No PR'ing new information etc) as part of their uplisting process and unfortunately this has made them an easy target for shorting and hence the share price has been battered down from .20 to as low as .055 recently.   


I and numerous others have been continuing to add to our existing holdings through all of this.

To go along with them I have some Cruz Cobalt $BKPTF simply because they share some board members with Spearmint and a bordering property in the Clayton valley. They have been nothing but down since I bought, but have been holding this bottom for a couple months now so might be a good time to buy in (or in my case average down).

550,gznii5a,2021-05-27,t1_gzmxl1a,pennystocks,"The insight is different depending on the person/situation/things going on in your life. IMO the main thing is more an intensification of feelings that may be dulled in everyday life. 

For example, in my head I know that I should take good care of my body, or put more effort into relationships that I care about etc. but many of us let life's distractions get in the way. When these topics cross your mind on psychedelics, the feelings of wanting to improve these certain areas of your life (as well as most feelings) are amplified X1000. All the little excuses you use to rationalize not doing them disappear, and you know in your soul that you can and will do better and can't believe you were so indifferent about whatever it is previously.

For me its not usually that I'm confronted by some ground breaking revelation that I had never realized before (though this can happen as well), but more that it almost forces you to think about issues in your life with emotion/feeling/energy so intense that it tends to stick with you even after the trip is over. 

Sure, some people do everything great and don't need the kick that psychedelics can give you, but many in todays world are often numbing/excusing/procrastinating their problems away to some degree, and this intense burst of emotional energy can sort of snap you back to what is important.",[],1

579,gznlboq,2021-05-27,t1_gznbd0o,pennystocks,"Royalties are paid as a distribution. However you are allowed to take depreciation on the wells as a tax deduction.

The distributions are considered ordinary income and taxed at your marginal rate. You can calculate the depletion ratio on PBT and similar royalty sites but let's assume you invested 100k in July 2020 and sold end of year. Your depletion write down would be roughly $2200 as a deduction on your tax return to offset the marginal rate.

However that's not typically why funds purchase the royalty, they purchase it for the short term high yield return on the royalty payment. This can be seen today with the price being slightly down on ex-div date which is normal for a slight selloff on that date for any equity that pays a dividend or royalty and new buyers come in and sellers allocate. I am also not playing the equity for a long term monthly distribution payment but instead allowing the monthly payment yield to pop and the underlying equity to rise so that I can sell my stake to a buyer looking to capture that higher dividend in Aug-Sept. I do plan to hold some shares long term for the distribution payments but it will be equal or less than my profit on the shares as I move to rebalance and allocate my capital to other holdings.",[],0

Shell companies often have large amounts of authorized shares to avoid hostile takeovers, then sell those shares to the company they're doing the merger with. In this case, Hempacco is coming in and has already said no plans for dilution (meaning moving those authorized shares to outstanding shares) for at least a year (and at that point, to use for acquisitions), and in fact announced they will buy back 300 million shares (remove them from the outstanding float). 

So when the details of the reverse merger were announced, and were perfectly normal by any other OTC reverse merger standards, people who obviously have no idea what they're doing heard 75 billion shares and panick sold. 

I'm always amazed at the amount of people trading in the OTC that have no clue how any of these things work. Anyhow, it's on sale and nothing that made people start buying in the first place has changed, so it's a good time to get in.",[],1

Others may do it to pump the stock and depending on their “DD”, I think most are lazy (a simple link to an article or a graph) or a clear copy/paste. I associate these users with how they respond to questions: they repeat the same thing, they recite the link (no added substance), or they backtrack and say do your own DD and I’m not a financial analyst defense.

1) Al batteries have been known, as well as their ability to be fast charged in a laboratory environment. So much of their statements are already known.
2) In my brief search it is unclear if they will be able to scale it from the bench to production. As with batteries with solid electrolytes, e.g. QS, many companies claimed to have made breakthroughs only to back track wlonce they determined it is much more difficult to scale at manufacturing levels. 
3) Al batteries in the laboratory typically have much shorter life cycles, the number of times they can charge and recharge the batteries. I didn't see any explanation of how they overcame this beyond a conclusory statement that it is comparable to Li. 
4) There are no details regarding what they use for the cathode or the electrolyte. These are what determine energy density, life cycles, heating during charging, etc. 

I will be watching this closely, specifically but am concerned it is an empty statement pump/dump. Need more info on manufacturing.

It looks like the research they conducting involving the sepsis treatment through macrophage Polarisation is good enough. It has a lot of potential, especially because the direct cause of death in covid cases are due to sepsis that results from uncontrolled cytokine storm. This was published last year, so if they have gone so far as to enter clinical phase, I would certainly invest in THEIR stock, but it may be rather far in the future until they can actually implement the method. As for psilocybin, I’m still not sure. Because the research article is a very specific protein structure that they are dealing with. It is not some substance they can extract from mushrooms. They actually design it specifically. Otherwise, they lose the ground for application altogether. Investors need more convincing link between psilocybin and the sepsis treatment or treatment for other diseases if you want them to invest. But if you like the shrooms why not buy their stocks.

1000,gzoux7x,2021-05-27,t3_nmgwj9,pennystocks,"I would start doing more DD on the companies you are looking at. First glance should probably be a 1 year chart so you can see if the companies have already run way up.  CSLI for example has lived below 1 cent for most of the last 5 years and it is probably going back. MAXD has the same pattern with just a lower price. GRNH looks better but still is 5x the price it has been at for most of the year. When you see penny stocks that are in positions like that they likely are going back down unless they have a some fundamental changes to their business that would justify the increases. 

Another thing to keep in mind, depending on when you bought, these micro stocks were all running on volume but since February virtually all the micro caps have been drifting down. Lower volume and no real business models means you are going to lose money. That seems to be turning around a bit but you definitely want to look closer and see if these companies have any value. Add more time to your DD. You spend a lot of time earning the cash you are investing so at least take a decent amount of time digging on tickers to weed out the scammy ones that are probably going to go down. 

Lastly, if you see a stock that is being pumped by a lot of people, you probably have already missed the run but this is also when you want to vet the information yourself. Don't just trust the poster and confirm details yourself. It should only take about 10 minutes to blow off questionable tickers and if they get past the initial check then definitely dig deeper to see if you can see news or other catalysts coming that will move the stock. If you do, then consider investing. 

You can expect a lot of bad decisions until you get more experienced. Just work at it and it will get better. There rarely is a reason to rush into any stock so if you see it has already moved up a lot, take more time to see if you should buy it. You probably wanted to be in before it moved as in penny stocks a lot are just pumps with no value.",[],0
