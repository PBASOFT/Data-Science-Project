If you want to invest in real estate long term (which is wise), you need to look at REITs and what type of property they rent. I recommend against going into residential because there will likely be some pull back once the rental moratorium ends. I also recommend against mortgage REITs because they are in a ugly place right now. 

I am bullish on healthcare reits and senior living though you need to be careful about the management. Lots of scum in the stock market and REITs are no different. Id stick to the tried and true big dogs with long histories of performance like Ventas, Welltower or National Health Investors. There are other good ones, just saying to do your DD.

Safer because a car that stops and calls an emergency number when the driver isn’t paying attention to the road will protect the driver and those around him, both in cases of legit issues (sleepiness, health problems) and more critically from the fools who think is fun to abuse the system.

You are mistaken because the car already does that while driving itself. If you fall asleep at the wheel, the car will beep loudly, turn on the hazard lights, and bring the car to a complete stop. Although, it doesn't make a telephone call AFAIK.

>more critically from the fools who think is fun to abuse the system.

Trying to outsmart a bad actor with physical access to your device is futile. If there was a camera system, in addition to all the other systems, what would stop the abuser from setting up a screen in front of the camera that plays a video that tricks the sensors? Or removing the camera and replacing it with a Raspberry Pi that sends a false video feed? A motivated individual will always be able to beat the system. It's better to improve the driving safety systems for everyone than to try to outsmart the bad actors.

>lacking this monitoring system and given the frequent abuses, your Autopilot will eventually be made illegal.

Which is why traditional cruise control is illegal, because it gets abused and people crash and die? The argument that a system must be 100% safe or 100% foolproof is flawed. Drivers are still responsible for what their car does, even if they are ""not at the wheel"". Someone engaged autopilot, and they are the pilot-in-command of the vehicle. No one is advertising a fully autonomous driving system, at least not today. 

In Q1 2021 Tesla reports one accident for every 4,190,000 miles driven with Autopilot. The NHTSA reports an accident every 484,000 miles driven for traditional cars. It's a safety system and it works very very very well.

Autopilot, as it is today, would only be made illegal in a world where driving manually is also illegal. I doubt that will happen in my lifetime, but it would be fantastic if it did! Every car on the road would be fully self driving and the crash rate could be virtually zero. Autopilot drives 9x better than a human does, and keeps getting better.

390,gyx9pxf,2021-05-21,t3_nhnnui,stocks,"Let's check out the numbers comparing it to one of the maddest gambling   
countries in the world: UK - a country where online betting is legalized  
 and they gamble much more than other European countries.47% of Brits have gambled in some way in the last 4 weeks.On  
 average, Brits spend £2.60 per week on gambling, totaling over £135.20   
per year. According to Businessfirstonline online gambling accounts for   
38% of the total gambling market. However that is the total gambling   
market including casinos, sport betting etc. Exchanging the currency   
would result in 180$ per person and now the online percentage would be   
around $68 per person. In 2015 sports betting made 45% of all online   
gambling in the UK, so we now have around $30 per person. The US has around 320 million people. Multiple $30 with 320 and we get 9600 million spend in the US on Online Sportsbetting.Which would be 9.5 billion for the whole industry in sales. In the UK profit margins are:William  
 Hill 4.5% and Playtec is negative but has around 5% operating margins.   
These have several offline branches as well, so we say 12% is profit   
which is extremely generous over the long run due to promotions and   
advertismentTaking the theoretical size of 9.5b   
of online sportsbetting and applying 12% (which is very generous) would   
result in around 1.14b in revenue. Even if it would be double it is   
still a low number. Average P/E ratio of   
InternetB2C betting sites was 15.6 from 1999-2016 according to Credit   
Suisse, that would result in an industry that should be around 16b for   
online sports betting.Draftkings is valued at 17b  
 so in terms of online sports betting it is getting bigger than the   
theoretical industry of mad gambling Brits with US numbers. So while the

433,gyxcma3,2021-05-21,t3_nhnwg4,stocks,"Purely anecdotal here, but from where I sit, Beyond Meat seems to still be a niche product whereas Oatly has already crossed the through to that liminal space between niche/mainstream (perhaps you could even make a case that it is a mainstream product by now).   
  
Already 3 years ago, I started seeing Oatly in coffee shops in Shanghai as well as being sold through online retailers. And I'm not just talking nth wave trendy coffee shops--even my local corner spot went through cartons of their barista edition each daily despite charging the equivalent of an extra 50-80 cents for it. Half a year ago, I migrated to Hamburg and see it everywhere here as well. More so than in Shanghai, it also has premium retail space in the supermarkets with a wider portfolio of products (they're not solely making plant milks anymore, it seems). So in an average retailer here at least, I feel like Oatly has more skus and moves more product than Beyond does.

Literally everyone else out there trading today is more experienced than you and therefore most will be probably do a better job than you, at least at first. 

Therefore you are most likely to perform below average up front, will probably lose money, and will therefore be gaining experience in a very expensive way. 

Investing in index trackers allows you to start investing right away and guarantees you an average return. Literally average, half the money invested in your chosen index’s shares will perform worse than you and half will reform better. At the same time, you can try your hand at paper investing and still learn. When you know what you’re doing, you can move into the markets trading individual stocks. 

It’s your choice to make but bear this in mind, right now the market is at its peak, or very close to its peak. Valuations are crazy. You’re probably picking one of the worst years out of the last century to start investing because there’s so little upside.

To make a parallel, imagine you’ve never ridden a bicycle before. Tomorrow will be your first day. You’ve never even sat on one or managed to keep your balance. But tomorrow you plan to jump into a race, your first time on the bike, and everyone you’re competing against has raced before at least once, most of them for years. Would you bet thousands of dollars on yourself to win that race? Or even finish in the top half? No of course not. You’ll finish last. 

Learning to ride a bike is much easier than learning the stock market.

I bought IBM at the beginning of February and my position is up 21%. Anyway, I would suggest roughly equal amounts of money in FNILX, VTV, V and KO (or something else you choose). When you have a little more money, choose another company in another sector and keep building from there.

You can't DCA down from your paycheck long term because there's never enough $ from a few paychecks to change the cost basis when your portfolio is older than a few years. 

What you need to think about is why you are cutting loss.

If your argument is self-driving tech is going to go the way of fusion and flying cars as being always '30 years away', then fair enough, I respectfully disagree. Just look at the level of investment into this technology vs flying cars...

If I replaced my words with ""driving assistance systems"" it wouldn't be the same argument though?... Obviously driving assistance systems are coming (since they already exist).

I do agree that advertising anything as 'self driving' right now is careless. In aviation there is a metric of intervention miles which is a measurement of how often an automation system has to be interacted with by a human to prevent an incident, this is measured in millions of miles typically...

Fundamentally, humans are terrible drivers. It is by far one of the most dangerous things we all socially agree to do. It really isn't that much of a stretch to think that a computer could out perform a human in the task. Maybe there would be a statistical trade for certain accident categories.
