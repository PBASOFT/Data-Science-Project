And this is the example:  


""Joe Taxpayer earned $35,000 in 2020. He pays 10% on the first $9,875 income and 12% on the income that comes after that. His total tax liability is $4,003.

If Joe sells an asset that produced a short-term capital gain of $1,000, then his tax liability rises by another $120 (i.e., 12% x $1,000). However, if Joe waits one year and a day to sell, then he pays 0% on the capital gain.""  


According to the article, ""short-term capital gains for assets held for less than a year are taxed at ordinary income rates""  


Here are the rates for 2020 income tax:

* 10% on income up to $9,875
* 12% on income over $9,875
* 22% on income over $40,125
* 24% on income over $85,525
* 32% on income over $163,300
* 35% on income over $207,350
* 37% on income over $518,400  


If Joe produced a short-term capital gain of $ 1,000 (which is lower than $9,875), isn't it true that he should have paid 10% of $1000 (equals $100), instead of $120?

You realize CN and CP also use trucks. So they too would be using these electric trucks or self driving trucks.

How are things at the $2 billion deli?

Hometown International, the mystifying New Jersey deli company that is valued at nearly $100 million on the stock market — despite running just a single deli — has ousted its CEO, according to a financial filing. 

Paul Morina, a local high school principal and renowned wrestling coach in the area, was removed after a vote by majority shareholders, according to the late Friday filing.

Morina owns about 1.5 million shares of the Paulsboro-based company, which are worth more than $18.5 million based on the company’s current stock price. 

Shareholders of the company also ousted the company’s only other executive, vice president and secretary Christine Lindenmuth, who works in her day job with Morina as an administrator at Paulsboro High School.

Here is the filing, from last Friday. It is not quite accurate to say — as the New York Post’s headline does — that shareholders fired Morina. It’s more that they demoted him. He lost a lot of titles:

On May 13, 2021, the Board removed Mr. Morina from all officer positions he held with the Company, including President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer of the Corporation, effective immediately as of such date. 

But he still runs the deli:

Mr. Morina and Ms. Lindenmuth remain principals of the Company’s operating subsidiary, Your Hometown Deli, LLC.

See, Your Hometown Deli is a deli in Paulsboro, New Jersey, that occasionally sells sandwiches, mainly to curious financial journalists. Hometown International Inc. is a U.S. public company, with a basic market capitalization of about $100 million and a fully diluted market cap of about $2 billion, that is some sort of mechanism for taking a foreign company public in U.S. markets and that also happens to own the deli. The $2 billion public company is now run by Peter Coker Jr., a Hong Kong-based financier who was already the chairman of the board and a major investor in Hometown International, and who “intends to devote his full time to seeking a business combination for the Company,” as the company said back in March. It makes sense that the mergers guy in Hong Kong would run the $2 billion company that’s in the business of merging with an Asian company, and the wrestling coach in New Jersey would run the local deli in New Jersey. Sensible division of labor! It was always weird to have the New Jersey wrestling guy in charge of the Asian merger company! Also it’s weird that they’re the same company.

The deli has had some other good filings recently. Yesterday it disclosed that its quarterly report will be late, “because the Registrant needs additional time to complete certain disclosures and analyses to be included in the Report.” The relevant quarter ended on March 31, before Hometown became famous, so the problem is not that they sold so many sandwiches to so many financial journalists that their accounting systems couldn’t keep up. I assume that, given their recent scrutiny, everything just needs to be lawyered a bit more carefully than it has been in the past.

Also here is an April 30 filing in which Hometown “disavows the price of its publicly quoted stock on the OTC Markets under the trading symbol ‘HWIN.’ Management is aware of no basis to support the Company’s stock price, based upon its revenue or assets.” I am not sure I have ever seen a company “disavow” its stock price before, but I suppose it makes sense. The filing accurately notes that “there has not been, nor is there, significant trading volume in the Company’s stock,” so it’s not like anyone is particularly getting ripped off by the deli’s weird stock price. It’s just a weird artifact. Still, probably best to disavow it.",nfgipo,[],0

288,2021-05-18,investing,"Passive investors say not to pick an outperforming mutual fund or ETF because you don’t know that it will outperform in the future. However, they look at market returns from the past to predict or expect returns in the future. Just because businesses have grown at a rate of 10% annually since 1926, why should investors expect 10% in the future?

It seems illogical to have your retirement rely on a system that is based on past performance from only the past 95 years. If a 20 year old starts investing today until retirement at 65, that’s 45 years. 45 years is 47% of the S&P 500’s existence, yet people say there’s enough evidence to expect a certain future return. If we had 1,000 years of historical data showing that the S&P returns 10% annually, I think that it would be ok to say that 10% can be expected for a 45 year window of retirement investing.

Saying that 10% returns can be expected in the future because thats what’s happened over the past 95 years is just using past performance to project future results. The passive investor frequently says that it does not make sense to expect certain future results because of past results.",nfhan1,[],0
371,2021-05-18,investing,"So, I've been doing a lot of research while i wait for my bank to connect to fidelity. Did my best to pick high performing ETFS. In my research, I come across a lot of recommendations for Vanguard this or that.  


So I decided to do a test on the portfoliovisulizer website. with the following, VTI, VXUS, and BIV (interm term bond)  


The results only showed results back to VXUS start date of Feb 2011. But when compared against the Vanguard 500 index investor,  using 3 portfolio allocations, of 40-30-30, 60-20-20 or 80-vti/ 20- vxus, The final balance underperforms the index by 3-10%   


So I get that perhaps the vanguard ETFs are great for people who dont want to do much work figuring out what to pick. (I just spent about 3 days comparing various ETFS), but they aren't the best options out there as the internet makes it seem, at least based on my limited knowledge and comparisons the last few days. Many other similar ETFs by other companies outperform vanguard if you just take some time to look.   


My strategy if you are interested:

I dont have a lot to invest personally, but my strategy is to seek funds with high dividends.  I think I'm going start off with $2000, maybe more. 

For the first 1000 I'm going do a somewhat simpler portfolio which is more or less an overall index. Not sure every security is represented, but the ETFS I have picked are mostly better than Vanguard options. 

The second, 1000, I'm going with funds based on sector strategy. (tech, health, energy, etc) plus a few others that I think will be growing as we bounce back from this pandemic. Again, tried to find high performance from past years, and high dividend funds.   
   
Only downside to this, is I will have 38 funds to manage.   
But 10 funds, have dividends over 3%,  another 8 between 2-3%  


I couldn't run all my picks on the portfolio analyzer site with a free account, so I split them pretty much with the two strategies above at 1000 each (carried a few over due to fund limit of 25)  


But I plan to contribute 100 monthly (50 toward each strategy in my simulations. Removed a few stocks that didn't have data for 10 years, but in the test my sector portfolio beat the benchmark by about $700. My other portfolio was below the bench a bit, but close.   


So, I'll keep rebalancing to see if i can get better numbers, or perhaps stick to what I have since the future is unknown.   
 But its been an interesting experience. who knows, maybe ill have something else completely different if I have to wait much longer for Fidelity to let me deposit.",nfi5jg,[],1

>!Disney!<

>Not every business had the opportunity to transform/expand in the wake of Covid. Some businesses were well positioned to capitalize off of the pandemic and their stocks rallied as a result (DOCU, SPOT, ZM, etc...), however they are not all the best picks moving forward into 2021-2022. Still good picks long-term, but if we are comparing the possible return over the next 12-24 months, I believe they will be outperformed by the more cyclical stocks that will benefit off of the reopening. Disney was a weird one in that they were able to put their park operations on pause and focus on the expansion of their streaming services. They now sit at the helm of a huge content library in a world where streaming services are taking over the entertainment industry. Having this characteristic IN ADDITION to the incredible pricing power they have in their park and cruise-ships is largely what makes this stock/company so attractive to me right now.

&#x200B;

**Disney's income streams ---->**

|Disney +|HULU|ESPN+|

|21st Century FOX|The Parks and Cruise lines|Linear Networks|

&#x200B;

>**Some technical analysis I believe is relevant** \- Over the period starting 2010 and ending 2015, the stock rose roughly 3x to highs of about $120/share from the $40 range. This was after a long consolidation period lasting approximately 10 years where the stock was unable to leave that $40 level. Once the stock was able to break out of the range it was in however, it rose in a nice bullish trend above the weekly 50 day MA for nearly 5 years. I noticed that it has now been in a consolidation period for about 6 years after reaching the highs of $120 in 2015. The highs of $120 were temporarily broken in 2019 with their expansion efforts and made highs of $150. Then Covid hits and the stock crashes to lows of $81. After recapturing the weekly 200 MA and consolidating for awhile along that $120 price level the stock broke out and posted new all time highs of $203. We are now coming back down to test for support along what was once a level of resistance (realistically could go as low as $150 before reversing). This is a pattern that plays out time and time again and seems to be in line with the company's growth as well as the growth we can expect to see over the years to come. I expect the growth spurts are closer together for a number of justifiable reasons. We are likely entering into another period of growth as they continue to firm up their streaming services and open their parks back up.

Disney's stock has shown solid growth in terms of EPS over the past 10 years, showing a small retracement in 2019 due to their various acquisitions and investments into Disney+, the expansion and continued development of HULU and ESPN+, and the integration of 21st Century FOX.

&#x200B;

>I am certainly not an expert at valuing companies. I tend to spot trends and have a knack for thinking ""long-term"". I try to think about what might happen as things unfold. The overreaction the market saw in 2020 is being paid back now as the tech sector pulls back and attempts to find its footing. 2020 earnings were all over the place depending on what company we are talking about, but there were obviously some big winners. Most of the companies who saw huge earnings hikes will likely continue to grow at a reasonable rate in 2021 relative to the growth they saw every year prior to 2020 - still investors will sell stock after seeing earnings are down from 2020. How anyone could expect growth like that to be sustainable is beyond me. I figure it is just a bonus for these companies and they will be able to use the extra income to develop faster or combat inflation/economic troubles moving forward. It is not a gauge for future growth. 2020 was an anomaly...With this being said, Disney stock has been able to perform well over the past 12 months due to what I would call ""safe speculation"". Earnings were down big but the company is a behemoth - people know about Disney. Investors trust that the park will open back up and they will continue to do what they do. While a number of ""pandemic plays"" will be struggling to show revenue/growth anywhere near the levels of 2020, Disney earnings should be decent and should begin to level back off and stabilize. I believe a number of good companies will drop on good earnings this year until things level off.  
>  
>The company currently has a market cap of 308 billion. Keep in mind I said I am not expert at valuing companies. But with that being said, I do believe it is undervalued. Netflix alone is CURRENTLY valued at more than 215 billion with about 208 million paid subscribers. An article was released in Jan of 2020 stating that Barclays was valuing Disney+ at more than 100 billion alone. The service has added over 70 million paid subscribers since then, now totaling over 100 million paid Disney+ subscribers. The company anticipates around 230 to 260 million subscribers by 2024.  
>  
>Their direct-to-consumer segment includes HULU which has not been a huge profit generator, though I can personally attest to the fact that I would not even have Disney+ if it were not for HULU. Disney+/ESPN+ is not necessarily a package I would be interested in. The addition of HULU makes it worth it for me. I was already paying for HULU and figured it made sense to add the other 2 services for not much more $$$. Disney has agreed to take over the remainder of HULU from Comcast in 2024. I am interested to see what they do with it then. 

What is pricing power and why is it important ? Pricing power simply put is a companies ability to raise their prices over time for their services. Not only is Disney continuing to offer more and more value to their customers, but they also run a number of theme parks with attractions that are confined to Disney alone. A tourist could not simply choose to go elsewhere for their Disney amusement park needs. Disney is the only place you can see Disney. We all know the feeling of walking into an airport or an amusement park and thinking ""welp, today I am going to be overpaying for everything"" - but that's just how it is and we accept it. In an inflation economy, pricing power is absolutely key and this company has it! They are also continually reinvesting into their brand which has helped them maintain strong momentum over the years. 

This is a statement taken from a write-up by JPMorgan on pricing power -  **""Pricing power is one of the key attributes of a quality compounder. A key difference between a compounder and a cyclical company is that the compounder has the ability to sustain revenue even when demand in the economy contracts""**",nfipvu,[],1

672,2021-05-18,investing,"Notes from Toyota Motors (TM) 2020 full year Earnings Call (13 May 2021)

Why do you care? Good question, automobile manufactures have gotten higher multiples (at least for a short time) based on producing, or moving closer to producing Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), and sometimes just by pretending they will change their name to emphasize Electrical terminology, and of course having a company named after the people who discovered how to make electricity work gets really high multiples (doesn’t work for utilities named after Edison though). Toyota has been reluctant to move into the BEV space, did this change? Will they rename themselves after Alessandro Volta? Let’s find out.

First, I really want to thank the modern world that can take spoken Japanese from multiple speakers and convert that into written English so cheaply that I can read it on the internet without a paid subscription to anything! It’s a wonderful time to be alive!

Oh, I guess it's fashionable to add a disclaimer so the black helicopters don’t come and lock me in a bank vault without my reading glasses or something right? Fine, I make my living breaking big atoms into little atoms so nothing I say or type should ever be considered medical, financial, legal, or romantic advice. Good enough? Let’s go.

I can’t find an old blog post I read in the 2009–2011-time frame to give credit, but it was pretty insightful, the blog author did a word search for “customer” in both the Amazon and IBM earnings call, and showed how Amazon (huge number of times saying “*customer*”) would be a better investment because that’s where their focus was compared to IBM which had very few hits for “customer”.  I haven’t checked, but I think Amazon has had slightly better returns than IBM from 2009-present.

CTRL-F for “*customer*” returns **53 hits** for TM, things like:

>“And Toyota is always listening to customers, always trying to develop products that are suitable for every part of the world. And we have to remember that the goal is not electric vehicles. The goal is carbon neutrality. And even if we have the best technology, if it's not chosen by customers, it will not have the impact of reducing emissions and that's the reason why we've chosen to have a full lineup, and we've invested in all of these technologies.”

Compare that to **their competitor**, the largest automobile manufacturer (**by market cap**) most recent earnings call shows just **10 hits** for “*customer*” with things like:

>“we had not yet begun customer deliveries”  
>  
>“what we obviously opt to do is to refund customers their deposit”  
>  
>“continue to accumulate bitcoin from transactions from our customers as they purchase vehicles”

Quite a difference in company philosophy!

Starting off with the prepared statement, this company is a beast! Their fiscal year begins and ends in March so this is for the entire Covid year without the benefit of the Jan-March 2020 pre-Covid or the reopening time after vaccinations ramped up, this is the worst possible time period and the sold 9.087 Million vehicles (96% of 2019 numbers) under the Toyota/Lexus name and an additional 7.646 Million consolidated vehicles (85.4% of 2019 numbers).

Quick note, they use the term “electrified vehicles” to include Hybrid (HEV), Plug in hybrid (PHEV) and battery electric (BEV) and Hydrogen Fuel Cell electric (FCEV). The sales of electrified vehicles were 112.3% of 2019, which I think were mostly HEVs.

They went through all the various gains and losses to operating income (currency exchange rates, marketing, cost reductions) and overall operating income went UP by 10 Billion (JPY not USD). Then announced the dividend at a payout ratio of 29.8%. Announced a resumption of share buybacks (had been suspended during the pandemic) of up to 250 BILLION (JPY). Also, a five for one stock split will happen on September 30 2021.

Next the future projections, consolidated 113% of 2020, Toyota/Lexus 105.6% of 2020, and expected 2.8 Million electrified cars 129% of 2020 (29.2% of vehicles sold will be electrified). Again, a breakdown of predicted expenses with an overall prediction an operating income increase 365 Billion (with a B, in JPY)!!

Next, they took questions. First question wanted more detail on predicted finances which they answered, then a very detailed discussion of the plan:

>“By 2050, we are to realize carbon-neutral. That is our target. The new vehicle CO2 is not the point. Transport use -- this overall cycle of CO2 use will have to be made neutral. That will be the point. So at this point, rather than restricting or limiting the types of technologies to be used, in order to realize carbon neutrality, various options or various technologies will have to be addressed. We think that will be the most important point and that is where Toyota is putting its entire efforts in. More specifically, we at Toyota has HEV, PHEV, battery EVs or BEVs or FCEVs”

From later in the call, but I wanted to move it here since it explains how they define the term:

>“What does carbon neutrality actually mean for the automotive industry? Carbon neutrality for the automotive industry means achieving zero CO2 emissions in all processes throughout the lifecycle of manufacturing, transporting, operating, fueling and/or charging, and recycling and disposing of vehicles.”

Then they discuss very specific breakdown of anticipated sales of electrified vehicles by region by 2030 and:

>“And globally, this will add up to 8 million electrified vehicles, including hybrids, out of which battery EVs and FCEVs in total would account for about 2 million units. That is our plan. Of course, ultimately, the choice is up to the customer. But at this moment, this is what we are forecasting.”

Followed by a detailed discussion about the scope of the challenge for future battery production and:

>“at the moment, Toyota's supplied power is 6 gigawatts hours. And in order to realize these numbers, 180 gigawatt hours is necessary; in other words, 30 times the current number. So if you translate that into EV production lines, currently, we have two lines, but that will have to be more than 60 lines, that is more than 30 times. So we will make aggressive investments so that we can realize that. And in addition to that, for battery development or basic units will be reduced, and we will work with alliance partners for procurement so that we can procure the necessary goods. And in addition to that, for battery EV development, compared to the current situation, 15% to 30% reduction in development lead time is to be aimed at. “

And

>“So for the investments, electrification case, digitalization, roughly speaking, on an annual basis, we are currently making an investment of JPY 1 trillion. This year, compared to the past levels, we intend to increase investment by 20%”

Did you notice that number, Trillion! I ran out of fingers and toes to count how many zeros that was.

Next the BIG question: “**how do you see the supply demand forecast for semiconductors**?”

Well:

>“The supply demand situation still can fluctuate and we cannot sit back and relax yet, but we are not forecasting a major impact by semiconductors”

Compare that to **their competitor**, the largest automobile manufacturer (**by market cap**) most recent earnings call:

>“yes. This quarter, and I think we'll continue to see that a little bit in Q2 and Q3. So Q1 was -- had some of the most difficult supply chain challenges that we've ever experienced in the life of Tesla and same difficulties with supply chain, with parts -- over the whole range of parts. Obviously, people have heard about the chip shortage.  
>  
>This is a huge problem.”

Am I just cherry picking, trying to sensationalize something for clicks? Well, here is **what Ford had to say** in their earnings call:

>“The semiconductor shortage and the impact to production will get worse before it gets better. In fact, we believe our second quarter will be the trough for this year. We have worked to do to get our industry footprint back to firing on all cylinders or maybe should I say fully charged. Overall, though, I'm proud of the progress we made as a team, as our underlying strength at Ford improves”

Then another important question “you also showed the outlook for carbon neutral for 2030, and you talked about 6 million, and your plan was to increase carbon-neutral vehicles and PHEV. And could you share with us the reason why you believe customers will be choosing those vehicles?”

Remember the customer! Here’s part of their answer:

>“And for 2030, for one thing, as Mr. Kamisawa mentioned in his own question, the battery EV, its prices and availability of infrastructure on the global situation is not likely to progress significantly. That's one assessment. And with respect to hybrid EV and plug-in hybrid EV, those are easier for customers to choose and use.  
>  
>But I would like to add further to that question about the Japanese data. We are focused on connectivity or connected. And through connected network, we obtain information and data on vehicles. And even in the case of hybrid EVs or plug-in hybrid EVs, especially in urban areas, the distance traveled by electric mode is quite long. And probably, we can share with you later on, but in the urban areas, generally speaking, there is some difference between urban area and suburban areas, but in urban areas, even in the case of hybrid electric vehicles, about 50% of the times, it is running on the electric mode.  
>  
>And in the case of PHEV, of course, there are differences in conditions, but 70% or 80% of the times, it is driven on pure electric mode. So hybrid EVs or plug in hybrid EVs, not just their performance and also the data that we can obtain through connectivity, and also, we use information we obtain from navigations. And using that, depending upon where the vehicle is located, the EV mode ratio can be increased or decreased, so adjusted. And those can be doable in the future through hybrid vehicles as well as plug-in EVs. So we would like to make contribution to the environment in a sustainable manner as well as practical manner.”

So the first hour of the two hour call was intended to be focused on the financials and the second half on the future (more long term plans) for electrification, batteries, data and Woven City. The questioners wanted to focus on all that stuff right away, so they answered the questions.",nfl8th,['TSLA'],0
778,2021-05-18,investing,"Is it Possible that Michael Burry (Scion Asset Management) Purchased Tesla Puts as Part of a Credit Spread?

One bullish option strategy is to buy put options and write a put option with a slightly different strike price to gain a premium on the options sold while hedging their position with the slightly cheaper put options. [Explanation here](https://youtu.be/sZrMhrmhDCQ). The goal is for the options to expire worthless.

Are fund managers able to write options without reporting them on the 13F and is it possible Scion is doing a credit spread? This might be apparent if the options transactions were located and there was accompanying writing of options at the existing strike price with the same expiration date.

Wondering if this is possible  - though it makes sense that the put position is bearish given TSLA's current overvaluation.",nfm85a,[],0
801,2021-05-18,investing,"Hey guys,
I have a question regarding ethics. My mom gave me an initial investment of $235,000 USD. She knew I knew what I was doing because I grew my account from $15,000 to $100,000 in a few years. She gave me this money expecting an ROI of 10-20% within a year, but I was able to grow her initial investment to just under $1.2 million in 7 months. After realizing this profit I offered her $750,000 USD while I keep the remaining profit to buy a rental property and continue other investments. She argued how that is her money and she will give me $50,000 USD. I don’t think that is morally right as if I hadn’t invested she would still only have the initial investment. I would like to get a few other people thoughts on this. Thanks!
F.Y.I I am only 19 and in college so $50,000 is still a lot of money.",nfmc9y,[],1

I'm not sure if this is agains the rules but it really is a fantastic watch

This was an AMA done with Wes Christian, a lawyer who has been an advocate for financial reform for many years. I don't want anyone to dismiss this due to the fact that the whole Gamestop situation started it. 90% of the AMA was about some of the illegal things that are being done behind the scenes in our markets namely naked short selling, ""kicking the can down the road"" on fail to delivers, and some of the legal actions that be undertaken. These types of situations not only affect stock price but theoretically affect the actual governance of companies via the proxy votes (I was surprised to hear that 100%+ voter turn out was seen by Wes many times, and he even mentioned 200%+ on occasion not including all the people and institutions that don't bother to vote.) There are rampant issues in our markets that may not seem to affect the average investor like myself, but pose risks that I think everyone should at least be aware of. The only purpose of this post (and I'm sure there will be others) is to spread this information to as many people as possible because that's the only way to speed up actual reform that will benefit us all in the long term",nfo809,[],0
