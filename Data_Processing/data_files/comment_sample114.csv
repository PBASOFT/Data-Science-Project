Id keep all the lazy parasites at the bottom and be rid of the parasites at the top. Id rather slave away to feed lazy people than slave away to feed the greedy. Without the greedy, im quite certain the rest of us wouldn’t need to work half as much and live a comfortable life.

they drive the price down, invest during the bottom of the dip (which they control by selling en masse and creating FUD), and then create new laws regulating it to make it seem ""safer"", releasing new greener tech, new alt coins, banks begin accepting it under strict regulations and ""low"" fees,  which brings people back in. three years from now at the all time peak of crypto to date, they do it all over again. each time chipping away at the core of the crypto ideal by adding new laws and increasing the difficulty for the average miner or investor to make a profit, leaving massive manipulation (much like the stock market) in the hands of the rich and ultra rich. all the while we are drip fed stories of lucky teens turning lunch money into millions. 


the crypto market will not die. it will become something far bigger than we can imagine. a tool for the wealthy to increase control, and dogma, as they slowly peel away the masks of the anons, requiring ID and banking info, a list of every transaction. all the while sewing division and elitism amongst the coins communities.

satoshi nakamoto created in a way, a financial atomic bomb, its in our hands to decide as a community if this is the threat we will face together, by owning the majority, hodling, communicating, doing our DD, and recognizing the tactic, and countering. or laying back, selling at loss and succumbing to FUD.

NASDAQ was hit the hardest 2000 and 08 mess but S&P and NASDAQ well the whole market took a larger shared blow this last year from covid. Btw, 2014 and 15 was the global market sell off which all hurt the entire market.

317,gz4nqli,2021-05-23,t3_ni1z8t,StockMarket,"Ok I'm back. You asked me to compare vs your initial target. Again, I will lead with my last comment which is that since none of us know your intended goals, financial aptitude, or desire to actively manage a portfolio, then we cant provide any meaningful recommendations.

For example, I would have very different feedback depending on whether or not you intend to actively manage the portfolio or just buy and forget for 30 years. Specifically, there are certain opportunity sets based on the current market climate (value, international/emerging, small cap) that look very appealing compared to broader market exposure, and doing an overweight tilt in those directions \*could\* yield alpha. BUT, in the same way that current dislocations have made those opportunities attractive to buy, at some point in the future they will be more attractive to sell -- if you don't want to (or cant) manage your portfolio actively, then it doesn't make sense to tilt like that and holding broader market funds is definitely the solution. 

Let's make a few assumptions....let's assume you have a decent understand of markets/economics, intend to maintain moderately active as far as managing your portfolio, and have a high risk tolerance, and maybe most importantly you don't need this money within the next 5-10 years for a major purchase, emergency, etc.  

Given the above, here is my feedback:

\- Way too much s&P exposure. While it feels good now because it has been going straight up for 20 years, the s&P is at record valuations by almost every metric. And yes I know, interest rates, and this and that and \*insert excuse here\*. The fact is that price and time are the two largest determinants of return. If you buy at a bad price it's going to be ugly. Historical 10yr equity returns at current valuations are around 1-2% real. S&P has basically become a large cap tech index -- listen to any intelligent market commentary right now and basically everybody agrees that large cap US tech is the most richly valued asset class right now. No thanks. 

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/xyk4Lmzq/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xyk4Lmzq/)

\- International developed and EM are currently way cheaper than the US. Personally I have 60% of my 401k going into international markets right now (10% going to s&P although I do have another account about the same size with much more US exposure). There are lots of good ETFs to get broad exposure that range from simple (ie: IEMG, or VXUS) to more complex (IVLU, EYLD). Technically, EM chart is looking beautiful right now too. As you can see in the first chart, US has basically gone parabolic since 2000....as you can see below, EM has been range bound and is JUST starting to break out. 

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/8YMv8wlX/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8YMv8wlX/)

\- Value. Not much to say here besides the fact that buying cheaper assets while everything is inflated seems like an obviously preferential option. Value has been DEAD for the last 20 years but these sorts of risk factors have historically always mean reverted. This first chart below is vanguard value index (vtv) vs ndx (nasdaq)....basically value vs growth. Value has underperformed growth by around 70% since 2005. 

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/KOft8Cme/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/KOft8Cme/)

\- Buy equal weight instead of cap weighted. This is just something to think about generally as it does make a difference. Small caps have a different return profile than large caps (generally higher but more volatile) so if your goal highest growth possible, then you would want to hold equal weight indexes (instead of cap weight) and effectively overweight small/mid caps (that ""overweight"" is on a relative basis compared to the cap weight benchmark). 

\- The value factor is proven to exhibit itself more strongly in small cap stocks. In this moment (as size and value risk factor have been out of favor for 10-20 years), it's looking like small cap value will have a pretty strong run of outperformance over s&p.

\- Why are you holding gold? I assume just to diversify or inflation hedge? Why not also buy a commodities index and/or TIPS? I like metals/commodities right now but this is definitely a VERY cyclical asset class and will require some degree of ""timing"" or sell discipline in the next 3-5-10 years. Generally, the cyclicality of these assets is what causes them to underperform equities on a long term basis, but that doesn't mean that there aren't periods of opportunity (like now). 

&#x200B;

I realize that was a lot that I just typed up there....and a lot of reference to fairly dense academic concepts. My point is just that there are a lot of good opportunities in the markets right now but you need to be slightly contrarian if you want to take advantage of them. 

If I were to make very quick recommendations:

\- take 30% of the 64% s&P exposure and put it into a int developed ETF 

\- opt for a value tilted s&P etf instead of just the s&P (there are tons of options). 

\- Add small cap value US Tilt (SLYV) 

\- If you really want to go out on a limb, look for small and or value funds for the international exposure Ie something like EYLD or AVDV. 

&#x200B;

If you want to lean more on any of that, do some googling on risk factors, Fama-French factor investing, etc. Also, this guy Ben Felix provides the best videos (that I have found) on these acemic concepts.....he has a TON of really good content and breaks down the pillars of academic investing theory.

I have never known states not exercise more power over people when they could. And unless we suddenly exist in a stateless world, this idea of blockchain being a future we should want is a bit terrifying. 

&#x200B;

Unregulated currencies are likely to remain niche, and regulated currencies are likely to allow for monitoring on a level never before seen. Every $ you will spend will be observed, recorded, and used to measure what kind of person you are. Every decision will be measured against known predictors for obedience and compliance, and where your decisions are seen as subservice, you will either be denied access to things, or will have to pay more for the same thing. A sort of collective wide cronyism will be tacitly supported by reward ""good"" behaviour, and punishing ""bad"" behaviour.

It'll be dressed up as for our own protection, as reductions in liberties always are. We'll be told it reduces tax evasion to zero, that it makes funding for crimes close to impossible, and that if you've done nothing wrong, you've nothing to fear.

This isn't a lecture, but from experience. I made some mistakes with stocks, and was usually glad for not averaging down. I only averaged down with DMYD (SPAC) who became GENI, once they started winning major contracts. I only averaged down with GAN once they produced some numbers that mostly matched their guidance, having refused the previous QTR when the results were dreadful, and was prepared to jump ship with a 40% loss had another QTR of dreadful results occurred. I've lost count of the ""small"" bets on speculative stocks I eventually sold out of because most went nowhere or went down double digits.

Its changing in crypto to be sure.... but its still mainly buying the concept of future potential of what might be delivered to the market place once the road map goals get fulfilled. 

I see crypto as more akin to angel investing. Where you take on increased risk to get in early before a working business has been created and in exchange for that increase risk you can get high profit returns. But that risk might play out as out of 12 projects, 10 go belly up for a variety of reasons but 2 hit it out of the park and make it worthwhile. 

The biggest problem with crypto is a LOT of people invest in projects based on the name/whatever is trending on social media or some other vague concept they have that governs how they choose a project to put their money in! With zero understanding what the project is or if it has a hope in hell of delivering anything! 

Would likely have better results writing all the names on the ground, cutting a chickens head off and wherever it drops YOLO your life savings into that 1. 

Full disclosure, I've invested and continue to hold in about 25 crypto projects and say as someone willing to invest in the sector that its a train wreck in so many ways!

I have started to invest in crypto in 2015 when i was just a kid, excited about the technology behind crypto. I knew nothing, i was a noob. I made insane amounts of money and i lost it all. I experienced the whole rollercoaster. And I've learned a lot. I learned to manage these swings, to do my DD and to be confident in myself, my decisions and to accept the consequences. After years of trading crypto, i found out about stocks and compounding interest and ETFs, the usual stuff discussed on this sub. Coming from crypto to stocks was such an easy and smooth transition! I am very grateful that i started with crypto, took all the risk when i was young and inexperienced, lived it all, pumps 10000% in a few months and dumps of 99% in a few days. Then i got into stocks, now knowing exactly what i am doing for a change. And it is so damn easy. I see people freaking out when they're 50% down on their portfolio and i just chuckle and remember warmly my wild time in crypto... I accepted that i can't time the market. I know how to do a solid DD. I buy companies that i believe in. And i hold. I didn't sell anything during the covid crash, in fact, i threw more money in the market than usually. I love dips now. The bigger the better. Because i know my DD and current price of a stock doesn't matter to me too much. I know where a company is heading (after my DD) and that if i think that a stock is worth 100 now, will be worth a 1000 in 10 years, but tomorrow drops to 50, that is a great thing happening to me! This dip just multiplied my future profits, i love it! So, all I'm saying is that i started trading crypto without knowing anything and it was the best lesson i could have asked for. It led to me being confident and i dare to say good in investing in various areas, including stocks and crypto. And yes, i still hold a lot of Bitcoin and ETH since when i was a kid. And even after several ~90% dumps, those are still my best investments. And if you want to know my opinion on those now, well, lets say that i do not intend to sell those for ANY price within next 10 years. I wouldn't sell a single BTC even if BTC was now worth 10 million dollars. I'm not trying to push any investment. I like crypto as well as ETFs and stocks.

The point of crypto is that it will be used one day instead of real money is it not? I belive it will and I belive only bitcoin and etherium have a chance at that at this moment in time and so I belive only those two have ""long term value"". Doge, ADA, etc... all of those wont see adoption and wont grow as much IMO. 

But the thing is that if what I'm saying is true, the fact still is that these crypto currencies are seeing a 10%+ price movement per day so daytrading is extremly profitable... IF YOU'RE LUCKY. Because day trading these crypto currencies IMO, is no different to gambling at the end day and new investors don't see that.

 There are so manny new investors in crypto IMO that's an obvious sign of a bubble (one of manny signs). All my friends got into crypto in the last 2 months.

I mean no hate to him or anyone who dosen't know absolutly every term there is in the stock market. We all need to keep learning and improving I my self have no ide what I'm doing half of the time. I just think anekdotes like these make it obvious that we are in a huge bubble.

I remember back in 2010-2012 how everyone was just trying to figure out what the whales were doing to know a bit earlier when to buy and sell. If you Google Bitcoin Whales you will have a ton of results about them. Not that I claim every article is true, but whenever someone owns a majority of something and is uncontrolled, then this will lead to manipulation. Just look at the ""controlled"" stock market, how much manipulation is still going on there.",[],0
511,gz57v8k,2021-05-23,t1_gz56u8o,StockMarket,"Im really not a expert mate by ANY stretch! 
 
I just had exposure to the stock market prior to crypto so I transferred the same metrics over when researching what I'm looking to invest in. There are a HEAP of good books teaching what to look for when doing your Due Diligence with stock picks, its really no different in some ways with crypto. Get past the hype and drill down into the substance (if there is any at all). Its just a different asset class at the end of the day that is still in its infancy so carries increased risk as its not a mature sector with all the information easily accessible. That means you have to do more ""leg work"" yourself to find the good in the many, many, many bad projects.   

Happy to message if you want but please take it all with a grain of salt and always Do Your Own Research! I won't give tips on projects I like but happy to help where I can with the process of researching. 

In a nutshell though, learn to research stocks (lots of great books teaching this)..... and apply the same skill set to crypto projects.

594,gz5f0su,2021-05-23,t3_nj14zc,StockMarket,"I'm fairly new to the market but realise people only ramp what they hold to try and bid up the price. Do your own research is always good advice. One tactic I use is to think of something where value could exist and then do some research as well as seeing what more experienced traders are saying. If it stacks up I will buy. My best buy is one I found this way. It's an energy stock called peabody energy. The ticker is btu. Don't be put off when I tell you it is a coal miner. Coal is hated right? Sure, that's why btu was 45 dollars five years ago and about 6 dollars now. Yesterday's fuel? Sure, that's the narrative in the West, but in the east they are building new coal fire stations today lots of them in China and India. Coal miners like btu suffer because banks won't touch them... But this is good for btu because some miners went bankrupt leaving more market for btu. Heard of the commodity supercycle? Well coal is the last commodity to join it, but prices of coal are now at a high. But this is not reflected in the btu shape price... Yet. Because   pension funds don't want to be seen in fossil fuels, that means small investors can take advantage of the high coal prices by buying the coal miners while they are still rock bottom but about to hit it big on coal prices. Don't take my word for it, look up btu on twitter and on peabody energy website. Smarter guys than me say its going to 30 dollars in the next 2 years.

638,gz5jptm,2021-05-23,t1_gz56nue,StockMarket,"There are fundamentals behind crypto as well. And to make money, due diligence for that specific crypto isn’t definitely required. At its most basic, Bitcoin has become to all of crypto, what gold is to the dollar. But Bitcoin is just a single coin of many. Yes, there are coins who’s value is purely based on “hype”, and yes supply and demand is the number one value correction for crypto but, there’s only a handful of legit coins that can be used the same way Bitcoin can. Some coins are earned by allowing your computer to be a node on a blockchain. Some coins are used as “exchange” coins which allow you to acquire coins that aren’t listed on a major app. Some coins are used to allow instant fee-less transfers to the other side of the world. Celo allows you to take your countries currency, turn it into Celo, and send it to India in the space of a few minutes. The person in India can then change it over to their own fiat. The idea of crypto is to remove the financial institutions ability to control and monetize it, for the most part. It’s not for everyone, because it is very volatile but, it is still in its infancy. It will become more stable as time carries on. This will be the way our grandchildren make their wealth. It’s a way that anyone, who does their research and doesn’t expect to get rich overnight, can provide themselves a level of comfort that stocks can’t provide until much further down the road. Stocks are ultimately more controlled by the “guys up top” than crypto. And there is value in long term investment in crypto, if you’ve done your DD. The problem is you shouldn’t be checking your money and selling the next day. With stocks that happens all the time because a company goes under or doesn’t show enough growth. If you look at any worthwhile crypto, over and extended period of time, they follow pretty much the same graph pattern as stocks. It just happens much faster and on more of a macro scale.",[],0

Trying to compare BTC to stocks is a strawman that will get you nowhere. BTC is being used more of a store of wealth, like gold, but better in almost every conceivable way. The ability to keep and store unconfiscatable form of money is something humans were never able to have prior to BTC. It's something I can take with me anywhere in the world by just memorizing my private keys and maintain full custody. It's also value that I can transfer to anyone in the world, peer to peer with no intermediaries, almost instantly on the most secure network ever created. It's censorship resistant, so I can send/receive without being blocked by opposing or corrupt interests. Our traditional financial system based on technology from the 60s is no match for BTC. The days of waiting 5 business days for ACH to clear will be remembered like the way we remember fax machines. The days of having to drive to a Western Union or a bank (9-5 weekdays only) and paying 20% fees to send remittances are over.

The fact that you're unable put a price on one of the most revolutionary inventions in human history is a problem derived from your own ignorance. Metcalfe's Law can be applied to value BTC, where its valuation is proportional to the square of the number of nodes (users) in the system. You can choose to continue living in the stone age, but BTC network effects grow by hundreds of thousands daily. All across the world, especially in countries with hyperinflation and failing economies, people are seeking refuge in cryptocurrencies. It's easy for privileged sciolists in first world countries to shit on BTC as ""speculative"", when it's actually serving underbanked people all across the globe as we speak.

Your last paragraph has to be one of the most ridiculous things I've read in months. Imagine thinking fiat currencies have ""fundamentals"". They're backed by literally nothing, and monetary policy is a joke. Have you looked at the M1 money stock chart lately? It looks like a backwards L. Fractional reserve banking is also not a thing with BTC. Every BTC can be accounted for. It's also laughable to think you actually think that digital currency is a poor means of exchange, and that physically handling pieces of paper around is superior. LMAO.

804,gz5z2r8,2021-05-23,t3_nj14zc,StockMarket,"The best advice I can give are words from the investors that (stood?) the test of time.
Buy what you understand. Meaning, companies in a sector which you can comprehend.

Make a system, a collection of questions you want answered while looking through their earnings report.

Financials tells the investor almost everything he needs. P/E is helpful but doesnt determine a buy or sell, its usually sector specific or depending on the growth potential of the company.

Don't believe the hype, this is the investor killer. Always!

Profit growth over 5 years, good thing. Means the company is doing well.

Not issuing more shares, also good. Not necessary, it depends when the company issues more shares and why.

Share buybacks, usually good unless the company is significantly overvalued.

Managable debt, shouldn't burn a hole in their pocket.

Dividend is nice but not a must. A healthy combination of growth and dividend stocks usually helps over the longrun, since you're increasing the amount of money put into the market YoY or over quarters. A nice line from Sven Carlin (i believe, shoot me if im wrong), you can eat dividends, you cant eat growth. Pretty much means you can purchase things with dividends (more shares for example). 

Free cashflow, dunno why this shit landed way down here but this is pretty much critical, free cashflow goes to development, buying back shares, paying down debt, basically everything. Expanding their business, promoting products, product development. You name it, this is the bag of cash they can use. Ebitda is bs, they cant use money they have to amortorize or tax. Right? Makes sense.

965,gz6gr4l,2021-05-23,t1_gz56a5b,StockMarket,In my younger working years when bonds gave a reasonable interest rate it was common to run an 80% equity/20% bond split even for young people.  As bond yields dropped I moved to 100% equities which is where I was in 2000 and my smartest move was to stay in 100% equities and continuing contributing to my 401k and IRAs at 100% equities.  My values were down but my weekly payroll contributions bought cheap stocks.  So when the Market recovered my old money recovered and I made money on all those contributions I had been making weekly in the downturn.  Come 2008 I was in the same position and did the same thing.  So by retirement time in 2015 my accounts were back up and I could retire.  At that time I moved to a 50/50 equity/cash or CD allocation.,[],0

Although investing in the stock market has risks, it is not a zero sum game if someone is investing (buying stock) in a company for a long term.  Most people can make money over time.  The futures market is a zero sum game and it appears trading in crypto is too if only trading for the short term.  Positions in the stock market such as trading options and shorting the market however, are a gamble and are for the most part zero sum type betting.  But you are right, trading can sometimes be annoying when traders pitch what they happen to be trading in hopes of affecting its price.",[],0

This is wrong. It does not only drive the economy in other countries. This gives the ability for America to create new businesses and drive the economy as well in the US. 

This is like saying “damn we shouldn’t import salmon from Chile because we do not want to benefit their economy.” We go ahead and sell that salmon in a restaurant which creates jobs. This is just one example but their are a million products imported that create jobs for Americans. 

This was the big problem with trump trying to cause insane import taxes. His Canadian import tax on steel almost wiped out American companies like Harley Davidson.

Most of that loss happened in the first 6 months, dropping from ~15k to ~6k in June before plateauing and then dropping under 4k for December 2018/early 2019.

Bitcoin only exploded the past few months. It started 2020 around $8000, peaked at $10,000 in Feb, dropped after the pandemic hit, then took until August/September to recover to $10,000. It only started maintaining above $10,000 in October, and only started growing rapidly in December. It’s now around $33,000, half of its ATH over $60,000 in April.

Cryptocurrencies are volatile, even ones that are meant to act as a store of value like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Other coins like doge are literal memes: doge only has value because people buy it, there’s no limit on supply, so its price spike is entirely based on people buying and not selling. That’s obviously unsustainable when the entire reason people buy it is to eventually sell for a profit. This isn’t even discussing how doge is mostly concentrated in a few wallets (50% in 12 wallets, I’ve heard), so the owners could tank the price at any time if they decided to cash out.",[],0

This is where people are technically correct, but wrong when it comes to valuing crypto.

Bitcoin itself is limited. But there is no limit to how many copies of Bitcoin or competitors there can be. It's a world where a competitor can 100% copy McDonald's, and produce a product that is 100% identical. 

However, the new coin will have the advantage that a tiny percent of Bitcoin users will not own a ridiculously large amount of the coins. Bitcoin is less equal than North Korea. If people understood this, they wouldn't use it at all. Who wants to own an asset that can be devalued overnight when a single whale decides to cash out??? O, and we don't even know who the whales are. For all we know, we are enriching terrorists. 

One day, someone like Musk is going to make MarsCoin, copy the best coin out there (it isn't even Bitcoin now), and there will be zero reason to use Bitcoin original any longer.

What people miss is that ""Bitcoin"" is limited, but there is ZERO limit to the number of alternatives, and eventually one of them is going to be the Facebook to Bitcoin's MySpace.
