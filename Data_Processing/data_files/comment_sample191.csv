The fact the government isn't stepping in to delay this IPO is all the evidence you need that they are in on it too. If that entire scam of shutting down the buys on only hedge fund shorted stocks isn't a RICO act fraud, I don't know what is.

Now the government and the issuing bank will also be conspirators in this fraud.

My advice is to never deal with the bank who will do their IPO.  Have a cancel your Bank \_\_\_ day and never buy the stock.

There's a brake recall affecting some 350k-ish vehicles. One day on the highway, with my 7yr old in the back seat, I have a brake failure warning light. As I exit the highway, the brake pedal goes to the floor. Luckily the exit was uphill and I was able to essentially coast down to 30mph and the light was green with nobody in front of me, literally best case scenario I could ever hope for, and I coast through the turn and take it wide.

Ends up being a $900 repair to replace the brake booster and master cylinder because brake fluid leaked through. Literally textbook example of the recall they issued. EXACT scenario described.

Their recall was deemed finished by court of law and my truck does not apply because it wasn't made in the exact factory at the specific timeframe that they claim this defect was limited to. Literally said ""your truck does not apply"" all because it wasn't in the timeframe of manufacture that they settled with the courts on to limit the # of recalls.

Ford can get fucked, in my humble opinion. :)

Yet, here synthetic shares  and diluted borrowed shares to create synthetic shares are presented as legit disguised as ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù or as ‚ÄúHidden by Options‚Äù yet falsely dilute the real supply and get rewarded by paying a small fine out of the huge trillion win without being liquidated and jailed.   
  
Borrowed or manufactured and borrowed are all same synthetically and artificially dilute the real and loot investors by selling fake) and then destroy them is a price much lower than after the forced squeeze and for me makes sense. The stock to me is a game that the aggressor hunter play to trap the prey and loot them from their earned wages. But with AMC and GME. The hunted prey turned Apes and trapped the aggressors demanding justice.  
  
For me then it is about adding few shares ‚Äúnot options‚Äù but synthetic shares and continue to pressure agencies that what the aggressors hunters doing is not working this way and looting criminals needs to be liquidated and jailed.   
  
 For me, I buy and hold and I believe any price before forcing the Aggressor hunters to purchase the synthetic shares (Borrowed or manufactured and borrowed are all same synthetically and artificially dilute the real and loot investors by selling fake) and then destroy them is a price much lower than after the forced squeeze and for me makes sense. The stock to me is a game that the aggressor hunter play to trap the prey and loot them from their earned wages. But with AMC and GME. The hunted prey turned Apes and trapped the aggressors demanding justice.  
  
So, as I see it, it is vital for the people of good well of the world to win this battle and force agencies to prevent such ‚ÄúSo-called Legal due to protective intentional loopholes‚Äù yet unethical and criminal looting of the people without jailing the perpetrators.  
  
For me, avoid watching channels that those criminals use to manipulate and cover for those criminals. This to send a message that Apes uncovered you and business as usual is not this time.  
  
For me it is about avoid doing what the Aggressors hunters are used to steer the prey to do which is panic, take a small profit and sell moving to another stock. Well this may make short-term profit but it is what the hunters need. Then when I go to another stock and get trapped, I should not scream for Apes help, just lick the wounds and go as I played by the hunters rules.

green pieces of paper that were unhappy.

And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and

in terms of individuals being unable to formulate coherent and consistent thoughts, i'd put the number far higher personally

that said, ornamentation and status symbols have a strong cultural evolutionary component at the very least, if not an outright universal signal encoded in our biological machinery

we believe in social hierarchies because everyone else does, and this belief has persisted through generations because it confers practical evolutionary advantages, even if we cant individually reason out the mechanics taking place. then we use similarly culturally adapted symbols to signal our place in this social hierarchy

if you think the need for simple social hierarchy signals is going away any time soon, you are hilariously naive and myopic

If you don't like the church that's totally fine, we're all entitled to our opinion, but a lot of this is clear misinformation.

>They use a mere 0.4% of it for charity

They give .4% to *other* charities, like their contributions to the red cross. That doesn't count any of their humanitarian aid, bishops storehouse expenses, disaster relief, etc. I think any charity would look poor if you're metric was how much they gave to other charities. Having been involved in some of the welfare for my local area, I promise it's significantly more than .4%.

>Then they continue to break the wall of church and state by exerting their influence, like we saw with Prop 8 and Prop 2. They do this with their cash or by telling their members how to vote.

The church has pretty clear political neutrality policies, and doesn't give money to political campaigns or tell members who to vote for, they only express opinions on referendums that have religious implications (like prop 8). In fact, they've been pretty clear recently that there's no political party that is ""correct"".

>In short, their entire conglomerate runs like a corrupt business taking advantage of the tax code in a Trumpian way.

I don't even know what to say to this. Trump (likely) committed tax fraud by lying on his filings, and used bankruptcies to his advantage. I don't get how any of that is analogous to the church. If you think 501(3)(c) should be done away with and churches taxed, that's fine as an opinion, but it's not like it's illegal or immoral to be a 501(3)(c) in the meantime.",[],1

From our point of view, the church and the money belongs to Christ, we are just stewards. Self sufficiency is also a core cultural belief.

Great, but you see, you haven't earned anything at all, because you haven't sold anything.Or is your portfolio down by x%? Well, I have a great news: for the same reason, you haven't lost anything, because you haven't sold.As long as you don't lose your initial invested capital, it's fine. The only thing you would lose is a potential gain. Nothing more, nothing less. So, try to secure your initial capital and you'll be okay.

The overall decline in values would hit landlords, but result in lower rent. So people would pay less rent, allowing them to save for a house, which would be much more affordable, meaning they have a smaller principal payment, and can possibly go to the 10-15 year mortgages, which used to be the norm.

8841,gyp9bv0,2021-05-19,t1_gymyxl5,wallstreetbets,"Although I hesitate to say it, I blame this all on Trump. At the time his administration authored that first gigantic stimulus bill, of $2.2 trillion, practically anything would have been accepted. If anyone stood in the way of that first bill for too long, or put their foot down completely on it, there could have been hell to pay for them.   


$2.2 trillion in March last year, whilst people all over the world were preparing to lockdown their economies, used to *stimulate demand* whilst factories were supposed to be **closed** **during a pandemic**, was obviously going to lead to high inflation. Prices in the macroeconomy can be broken into 3 sections really if you think about it, profit margins + capital + raw materials. Capital includes labor inputs and taxes I guess as well as cost of buildings and machines etc. Inflation is when the cost of these areas go up. It's either company's are making more profits, or it's that capital costs have gone up, or the cost of raw inputs like petroleum have somehow gone up.   


During a pandemic the supply of goods and services is naturally going to be lower. Governments have placed restrictions on people, people are staying home because they're afraid, international travel is off. Now, normally governments can spend money and stimulate the economy without worrying about inflation, like in the last recession, because unemployment is high and there is plenty of supply of raw materials. You might be operating at like 60% of output, so businesses should be able to hire people or buy petrol without having too much of an impact on the price of these markets. During a pandemic, however, restrictions on output mean your potential output may be something like 80% of total output. So say you go and you spend enough money to put the economy at 100% of normal output, but potential is only at 80% of normal then suddenly you drive up the cost of commodities and labor.   


Trump spent enough in 6 months to put the economy at 120% of potential output for the next two years in my opinion. All he needed to do was look after the people and make sure they don't go bankrupt or become homeless. Secondary to that he needed to make sure no *normally viable* corporations went bankrupt *because of the pandemic.* This is to prevent permanent economic damage and to prevent the economy from spiralling downwards. After the pandemic was over and potential output has a chance to recover, you can then stimulate the economy back to 100%. In March last year he needed $1 trillion max for the next 12-18 months but he blew it in 6, didn't take care of the people so more stimulus was bound to be needed, and handed $1.5 trillion to corporate America to stimulate demand all the way up to 120% of output a full 40% higher than the prevailing 'full employment' levels. The money multiplies through the economy stimulating demand for a while but many of the people who actually needed it last year weren't able to get it.  


The government borrowed $3 trillion from markets when nobody was lending money. Liquidity was bound to dry up. Powell stepped in with quantitative easing to provide the trillions of dollars the government was demanding, because nobody else would buy that much I guess? Not without sending yields soaring. QE + stimulus combined to just print 40% of the money supply and hand it out for free at a time when it had no hope of fixing the economy. It was Trump signing the first stimulus bill that sealed the fate. That was the absolute bottom of the market, the price of fucking everything soared since then. Australian banks like CBA and Westpac put out multiple buy USD signals after this moment whilst the USD was crashing and destined to continue crashing. That's why this time is different and Biden printing more money is probably a mistake but it wasn't him who caused this inflationary period we're in.",[],0
