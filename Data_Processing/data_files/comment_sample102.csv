11,gzkfsqi,2021-05-26,t3_nlkofd,investing,"The problem everyone is missing here, and the reason we all don't just dump money into leveraged ETFs is volatility decay - 

Volitilty decay causes leveraged ETFs to generally underperform their non-leveraged counterparts (contrary to what some of the other comments here claim).

To explain volatility decay, say a stock goes down 10% - it's at 90% it's original value. Then it goes up 10% the next day. The stock is now at 99% (90% x 110%) of original value - NOT 100%.

If you 3x leveraged that stock - the first day, you would have 70% of original value. The next day, you would only have 91% (70% x 130%). So you lost 9x the money, despite only having 3x the leverage.

I know that's what they teach in business school these days, but I simply don't see any compelling explanation of why it is (or should be) the case. I'm also not sure why you think companies should necessarily be forward-looking, and I think my comment which you replied to explains why companies shouldn't have the objective to be a going concern if it destroys value.

If climate change is that big of a problem for humanity (and I mostly think it is), then it's our society's job to vote a government that will regulate and legislate to stop these type of things from happening. (I think a global carbon tax is the single best legislation that could be introduced to fight climate change) I don't think it's the role of private companies to be at the forefront of these changes \*\*at the expense of shareholders\*\*. (If it's not at the expense of shareholders then I think it's a great thing for companies to try and improve the world we live in)

XOM (any oil company) trades energy, and that is an advantage they do have, but the actual tech behind wind/solar is not something they have much of.

That said, other companies in history have managed to make those kinds of transitions and survived.  IBM started in the mechanical calculation market iirc and transition to electronic.  A LOT of other companies failed to do so and no longer exist. 

The reality is that the future will require a hybrid approach.  Hydrocarbons will not go away. But they will exist in an integrated market.  The question is whether or not XOM wants to become the dominant player in a shrinking pie or a late entry to a diversified portfolio.

In my experience working with the various majors XOM is likely the least suited to an integrated portfolio.  They are one of the least creative and slowest to exploit new opportunities out there.  But the things they do they do well.  Very well.

There are two things to consider.

1)  hydrocarbons are one of the most dense energy storage mediums in existence, and can be transmitted physically, with minimal infrastructure, nearly losslessly.  This is a massive advantage that will always make it important in certain systems, like jet fuel, or....

2) developing markets.  Most ""1st world"" countries use anywhere between 10 to 100 times the energy per capita of their developing counterparts.  For these developing markets to...well...develop, they need access to energy.  Hydrocarbons are the easiest way to expand energy access for these markets.  We arent going to power Africa with wind and solar, they will be powered with nat gas etc.   Additionally there are massive quantities of infrastructure they need to build that will require hydrocarbons to create.  The us has something like 20 B tons of asphalt on its roads.  Thats from oil.  To build out the roads needed to develop these countries that will be needed.

Same goes for all of the plastics/elastomers/etc that will be needed to build their cars, power systems, hospitals, you name it.  

Now think of the scale of the number of people in ""developed"" countries pulling the maximum energy draw, and the number of people who need to expand their draw (and the corresponding geography to build up).   There is a borderline immeasurable need for enhanced power and hydrocarbon product generation globally.

And before we say ""ok but won't that just make climate change worse?""  Well, yes and no.  Many of these poorer countries are meeting the very limited demand thay do meet with absolutely terrible methods.  Coal, straight up wood burning, simply replacing these with nat gas could massively reduce the global co2 emissions while simultaneously expanding the accessible BTUs.

Its a complex issue, no doubt, but we have to challenge the privilege of our perception when we think conservation is globally feasible.   In the developed world we should 100% be aiming to reduce hydrocarbon usage ASAP, but in the rest of the world we should not only plan for its expansion, but encourage and celebrate it.

Think of it like food.   I take time and care to think about sustainable agriculture and organic etc Yada Yada, but when it comes to starvation that is not the first response.

I thought about this recently that it's pretty ironic that Elon Musk is pushing for electric cars and renewable energy but in order for his company Space X to work, he needs all the fossil fuels he can get. So in a way, Tesla can be a self serving company by getting everyone else to get off fossil fuels and he and other space companies can just hoard all the fuel for rockets lol. I mean theoretically. 

And with all this venture into space, rocket fuel will need fossil fuels too. I did wonder about nuclear energy but apparently that's only if you're trying to go to mars. I think if we used nuclear for low earth orbit, wouldn't the nuclear waste/radiation just fall back down or contaminate us somehow?

Hmm I was hoping that developing countries could leapfrog developed countries by going straight to renewable, kind of like how they leapfrogged from landlines to cellphones or other outdated tech like fax vs email since they didn't have the infrastructure for older tech. 

Even if developed countries were to say subsidize or invest in renewable projects in Africa, you still think that wouldn't be possible? That's too bad since Africa has so much sun lol. You would think you could harvest a ton of solar energy in the Sahara but I guess your point is the storage and transportation of renewable energy is much more difficult.

Rockets actually dont use refined products, they are coming from chemicals.  The difference is that a refined product requires minimal modification to be made.  You could probably trace it back to fossil fuels in today's market but at the volume they are being used it could be sourced from bio/plastics pretty easily long term.

>Hmm I was hoping that developing countries could leapfrog developed countries by going straight to renewable

>Even if developed countries were to say subsidize or invest in renewable projects in Africa, you still think that wouldn't be possible?

Highly unlikely.   But not impossible.   The up front asset/capex expenditure for renewables is much larger than for hydrocarbon, generally.  Lots of steel on the ground.  Could work though, look at iceland and geo, but requires a very stable government to pull off.

I've always been an index fund investor. In February (bad timing), I liquidated and built a portfolio of individual stocks with many tech stocks and growth companies. Two of those companies were Lemonade and Appian, which were both touted on Motley Fool. I'm down a lot on both of these stocks, and really don't feel good about them (Lemonade in particular). I've wanted to hold onto these stocks in hopes that I can at least recoup my losses there. But the more I think about it, I bought these stocks when they were very overvalued, and I have no reason to believe they are going to perform in the future.

I'm faced with a decision I've never really had to make before. Dare I just sell these stocks at a big loss in order to put what remains into something safer or that I at least feel positive about? Am I jumping the gun? Or would waiting just be kicking the can, missing opportunity and generating greater losses for my portfolio? I realize there is no certainty to be found here. Can anyone share similar experiences?

\- Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions, thereby lowering its cost

\- All the goods sold in the front end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products that Walmart sells in its department stores.  Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices.  This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.  

Based on the above 2 points, Walmart improves both its own existing margins and at the same time improves those of the Rite Aid revenue.

The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.

If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $5 - 6 billion per year.

Covered calls are great until you’re holding the underlying 3pts below your cost basis and you can sell an atm call for .5pts. Now you’re just averaging down like the rest of us “buy and holders”.

Is Lemonade a good investment at its current price? The long-term expectation for the S&P 500 is 10% annualized (\~7-8% adjusting for inflation). I'll leave aside the whole ""do you think forward yield will be lower?"" thing - neither here nor there.

10% annualized over 10 years would mean the market cap needs to grow to $13.25 billion. Most insurance companies trade at 1-2x revenue, so let's say Lemonade needs $6.6 billion in revenue in 10 years to be fairly priced today. If they continue growing at a 40% annualized pace for 10 years (unlikely), they'll have $2.8 billion in revenue in year 10. $2.8B is only 42% of the target $6.6B needed to get a 10% annualized ROI.

You can work out all the math yourself, if you think it's worth the effort. Think realistically about how much Lemonade can grow, is there going to be more competition or are they the only company that can do what they're doing?

I zoomed in, but you'll have to also zoom out. Lemonade isn't the only company in the world. Trupanion $TRUP grew revenue 31% from 2019 to 2020, and its P/S ratio is only 6.6 (compared to \~55 for LMND). You have plenty of options, just need a diversified group of investments that's likely to return a modest 10% annually, altogether. Being overweight in a couple of losers will blow up that plan.

I personally would much sooner bet on FAANG stocks returning 10%+ annually over the next 10 years, than Lemonade (if LMND were $25 today, it might be a tough choice). FAANG as a group could do 15%, maybe 20% annually - wouldn't take much more than a sustained 15% growth to get there.

Last thing I'll say - one bad quarter will tank LMND, just like how FSLY got wiped out recently. That's what happens when years of growth are priced in, you could miss on revenue by a few million, and you're freefalling.",[],1

391,gzlal0o,2021-05-27,t3_nlccgx,investing,"# 30 year old with Low Income (13.5k) but low living expenses ($600-700) looking to open an IRA. Any tips or links to helpful Information and Resources? 

  
I just turned 30, and while my total income is pretty low at  
only about $13,500ish a year (YA, Phlebotomy Jobs suck, apparently...), my  
Living costs are ALSO pretty low, only roughly $600-700 a month. This is  
combination of low rent, the lack of any real vices (I don't smoke, drink, do  
any kind of drugs etc etc) and not really going out and doing anything. Most of  
my entertainment comes in the form of games and novels and the like.   
Suffice to say, that means despite being what most would  
consider ""Poor"", I've not really had to ""struggle"" with  
much. Even now, I've got about $2,000 invested in stocks that I play around  
with and use to learn, as well as about $4,000 in savings for emergencies.  
That's even AFTER buy a top of the line 10th gen computer just recently to  
replace my old one (again, even being ""poor"" by most standards).   
Now I know this probably isn't impressive to a lot of people  
here, more so those who make a lot more and probably quicker too, but for where  
I am and what I've had available to me, I think I'm going pretty well. That  
being said, I know I have to start planning for the Future as well.   
The Only problem Is, I don't really know HOW. My family had  
always been the ""spend it while you have it"" kind, or spent it on  
cigs, booze and drugs, so I never really learned that kind of stuff.   
I've tried my best to escape from that, but without knowing WHAT to look for, its been a slow process. 

Thus I'd thought I'd try asking here. 

Basically what I'm looking for (if you've managed to read this far) is any kind of resources on how someone can start a 401k, IRA or other such retirement plan in my setting. What do I need to look for? What Kind of Information am I going to need to collect? What are some pitfalls to watch out for? Are there better options? etc etc etc.  

Any kind of Help is appreciated.

I would also recommend investopedia to do some reading on retirement accounts.


But regarding your questions, IRAs are the easier topic so I’ll tackle that first. IRAs are personal retirement accounts that anyone can open. There are primarily two types of IRAs (technically a lot more, but I’ll stick with those two). These are known as a Traditional IRA and an Roth IRA. Both allow tax free growth (so no taxes on selling stocks or dividends in these accounts). This means the money grows much quicker. The difference between a traditional vs an Roth, is that a traditional IRA taxes you upon withdrawal, while with a Roth, you put post tax money in and can withdraw without any taxes. Contribution limits to IRAS (either Roth or Traditional) are 6,000 dollars of EARNED income per year. After 6000 dollars, you’re no longer allowed to contribute more.


Starting an IRA is very easy - with both Fidelity and Vanguard, the process is super quick - usually involves just applying with your social security + basic details. I recommend these two companies too, because they’re very reliable with good customer service. M1 finance is also pretty good as well.

One major pitfall to avoid - make sure you actually invest the money. A lot of people don’t realize but IRAs are investment accounts - not actual investments. You need to put the money inside the account into an investment in order to have it grow. Too many horror stories of people who just put money into the account and don’t invest it (I remember one story about a lady who put in 50k into her accounts, which would have grown to 300k if she’d invested it, but because she didn’t, it stayed at 50k). 

For your income - I would recommend an Roth. Because you are at a fairly low tax rate right now, a Roth will be good in case your retirement income is higher, or if tax laws change in the future.",[],1

445,gzle84h,2021-05-27,t1_gzlcmaq,investing,"Yep, you're on the right track. Definitely go for a Roth IRA specifically though, and not a traditional IRA since you're in a low income tax bracket currently. All 3 of those companies should be fine and have a straightforward process on their website to set up the Roth IRA.

Keep in mind that the max per year you can invest in an IRA is $6000 per year, and you can only invest ""earned income"" from that tax year, which is basically any money earned from working for a wage. For example, if most of your money during the year came from something like investment income or unemployment checks, and you only earned 2,500 from a normal job, the most you could contribute for that year would be 2,500, since you didnt have enough earned income to qualify for contributing more.

Getting your income higher should be your number one goal because there isn't much you can can invest at the moment on the salary. Definitely throw 6k at your ROTH IRA a year if you can, max it out every year but again, I urge you to invest in yourself.

489,gzlir4d,2021-05-27,t3_nlrpkx,investing,"Some people might, but I don't think this is a good idea for most people. It's an interesting idea to save in a ""city-indexed real estate fund"" as a way to track RE appreciation in your market, but even within a city, property values can vary quite a bit. It is hard to execute well in real estate. There aren't many details provided in that link, but I imagine these are most likely going to be crowd funded private investments, and nothing like publicly traded REITs or ETFs.

First, the idea of ""indexing"" to your neighborhood while saving for a home doesn't entirely hold up. When you are saving, you mostly only need to worry about the purchase price of the home. But when you own a piece of real estate, there is more to real estate return than just the appreciation (or depreciation) of property price. You're forgetting rent, repairs, management, taxes, maintenance, etc., which you would account for while investing in real estate.

Drawbacks are obvious when compared to publicly traded REITs. Concentrated bets, high fees, illiquid, limited fund/manager track record, conflicts of interest (property manager?). Investors taking concentrated bets usually want to know what they are buying and control or limit some of these risks. And real estate is illiquid. Without a public market, I imagine the investors in a ""city-indexed fund"" would not be free to redeem any time. If you have more money to invest, larger real estate funds and private REITs do exist. 

At this time, if you don't have a lot of money, I think the only real option is publicly traded REITs.",[],0

I think it could be a good deal longer term for AT&T - they unload a lot of their debt and can focus solely on telecom instead of trying to expand into more areas where they arguably didn't need to be. So, it should streamline them some and has the potential to unlock some growth in the share price and not just the dividend. That being said, can current management manage not to trip over their you know what's and enter into another not so great deal?

As for NewCo, it'll be interesting. HBO Max has a pretty solid catalog to compete with Netflix, Disney+, etc. And there are a lot of people who love their Discovery shows. However, they're going to come out of the deal with a lot of debt moving over from AT&T, so I think it remains to be seen whether that will hamper their growth in an industry where you need a lot of cash to dump into content. I am fairly certain that they won't pay a dividend (though I suppose they could start with a small one  but I'm not sure of the point if they go that route), so those looking for an equal dividend to their T shares may want/need to sell immediately and warp it back into something paying a dividend.

I have 200 shares of T and I haven't decided whether I'll hold or sell just yet. If it pops back up into the $32-$33 range, I may sell, take a little profit, and wait to see what happens. But, I may also hold and just see what happens with the deal and go from there.",[],1

Even big conglomerates that are working on future technology like Amazon, Google or IBM might have research and development teams, but it is not anywhere near a major part of their business.

Once in a while a company will come out with a revolutionary idea and be able to develop the technology to mass produce it and make it profitable, let’s use Tesla as an example. Tesla has been making headlines for years, all the way back when they came out with the original roadster, but investors were super wary of them because it was doubtful that they could make cars on a mass scale, and have people buy them.

Day 1: Index increases by 10%

* Levered Share: $10 \* (1+20%) = $12

Day 2: Index declines by 10%

* Regular Share: $11 \* (1-10%) = $9.90
* Levered Share: $12 \* (1-20%) = $9.60

Day 3: Index increases by 10%

But, I can tell you how I got started and how I think through things.

When I started I found a mutual fund that was a target-date retirement fund. (I don't recommend buying these directly)

But you can pull up their data sheets and prospectus and see how they work. They just buy into 5 or 6 other mutual funds that each capture a part of the market (ie. Large-cap Growth, Large-cap Value, Mid-caps, Bonds, international markets).

You can see what they bought and usually they have some charts explaining how they shift over time towards bonds over time. They shift into bonds gradually mid to late career, probably a bit earlier than most people do on their own.  Some brokerage firms also have an ETF portfolio builder tool you could use for advise, just see what they do differently as you input different things into the portfolio builder.

T.Rowe Price has a fund that targets a 2060 retirement, 2055, 2050, 2045, 2040, 2035, 2030, 2025, etc.... So you can see how they shift into different categories as people get closer to retirement.

&#x200B;

A more complex answer.... Eventually you have to learn to split up your investments into different purposes and you will need to think about the risk of each purpose differently. You also have to think about the time until you need the money.

Emergency Cash: Need \~$20k  Risk:ultra-low  I keep it in a savings account. This is my car breaks down. my house needs a new A/C unit. I had a house fire (which I actually did in Jan 2020).  I lose my job. This is money that can't go down much when there is a recession/crash, I might need it if I also lost my job

Extended Emergency Cash / Extended job loss: Need $40k Risk: Low. This is money I want to invest somehow, but I want it to be less volatile so it won't lose as much in a crash.  I got into some Bond Funds and one low-volatility stock ETF that showed lower risk. 

If you're saving up to put a kid into college, a new car, a house down payment, you have to consider each of those separately and think about the risk relative to when you need the money. Can you put off buying a house for 5 years? for some the answer is yes and they can be a bit more flexible and aggressive at investing their down-payment. But if you're paying for college in a particular year, you can't delay for 5 years. You need that money that year. You have to be lower risk nearing college.

&#x200B;

Retirement.... Depending on how well you're saving up and how much you need, you can have different levels of risk. I'm not going to tell you how much you need for retirement. There are tons of articles and retirement calculators online. Use those to find out what you need at age 65. To use a clean number I'm just going to say $1 million as an example value for what you need to get from 65 to 95+ comfortably and stay in good health. Maybe you don't take many cruises, buy expensive watches, etc..., but you can keep your house, feed yourself, pay for healthcare, go out to eat once a week, keep a car, etc...

This is the essential amount you need to protect. If you're able to save up more and/or you're on course to save up beyond that amount by 65, you can be a bit more aggressive on the amounts that exceed this. This isn't money you depend on to get by, this is the money you use to buy a beach condo, a boat, an RV, go on a cruise 4x/year. If you had money you were planning on passing down to your children -and- you will not rely on it, then you can invest it aggressively as they would at a younger age.

That essential amount needed to live comfortably through retirement, which for many people is all of their investments, is what has to be protected. When you're 70, you can't make more money to throw in there easily. You can look at the S&P 500 charted out from 1927, until now. Look at every major crash and every recovery. 2008 took about 5 years for the market to recover. 2000 took about 8 years for the market to recover. 1987 took 2 years. There are a series of others just like these. The only one that was particularly bad for an extended period was the great Recession. It was 20+ years.

What goes through my mind is I need to be extreme in making sure I have 5 years worth of my retirement needs in a ultra-low risk thing. This is going to be treasury bonds, CDs, savings account. This will let you make it through most recoveries with your other investments untouched. A market crash isn't going to touch this.

Invest money you need 5-10 years out in items that are low risk, but maybe not ultra-low. Maybe more municipal bonds and some safer corporate bonds. That will pretty much last you through every past market recovery, except for something of the great depression scale.

Then for money you need 10-20 years out you can use more diversified bonds that have higher rates with some more risk and more low to moderate-risk dividend value stocks. You get more return, but there is time for this money to lose some in a recession and recover too.

Money you need beyond 20 years out,  that you have a little more room to invest in the general market and get average returns.

Even if your 65, at retirement, and there is a market crash, you still have money in relatively safe places to get you through the market recovery, while you have money you don't need for 20 years when your 85 in the market. You're planning to live another 30 years, hopefully.... maybe more. You just need to have enough money in safer places to weather that recovery.

I'd also consider these time lines before and after you start your retirement. I might be 50 and retirement is 15  years away, but the money I need in 15-20 years should be invested lower risk dividend stocks at that point. So I will start scaling money I need at age 65 into safer investments as I approach retirement.

&#x200B;

When you look at the target date retirement funds or work with a financial planner, they will set up something that is more simple that just says at this age X% bonds, Y% Dividend stocks Z% percent S&P 500, and then at this age.... a new set of percents. But those percents were created by someone scaling risks, relative to the time you need the money.

FYI, the reason I don't like target date funds, you can only sell the fund as one lump sum. You don't get to pick which parts of it you sell for cash at different ages. If there was a crash, I wouldn't want to sell the assets I think will recover. I'd sell the assets I had in a safe place.",[],0

693,gzm53ae,2021-05-27,t1_gzki52f,investing,"There are, I think, a number of ways in which to respond to this in good faith.

Essentially, it is reducible to the matter of first and second-order responsibilities of the corporate sector and the political sphere respectively. The following speaks to a responsibility to stakeholders more broadly as well, but we'll keep it specifically to climate-related matters seeing as that's the topic.

First and second-order responsibilities roughly align with climate change mitigation and prevention in this instance. The first-order responsibility the corporate sector has to mitigate climate change is a two-fold necessity. Firstly, they aren't children and should not expect others to clean up their mess or prevent them from making mess. There's no reasonable way to deny the reality of climate change, and as a substantial contributor to it, the corporate sector has a responsibility to modify its behaviour to mitigate the damage it causes. There are obvious other issues as well, such as the corporate sector not adhering to law and regulations anyway - a good example for this discussion being the Volkswagen 'Dieselgate' scandal. But if it just being the right thing to do (and quite obviously so) is not compelling enough a reason, then a discussion of second-order responsibility, I hope, will be more fruitful.

What you say about it being a governmental responsibility is true. Specifically, I would say they have a second-order responsibility to prevent the corporate sector causing harm. However, it simply isn't that black and white an issue. As we saw with Dieselgate, imposing regulations is not always effective. If it were, then the matter would be much farther resolved than it currently is. But the issue with political responsibility is actually a lot more systemic. In the case of climate change mitigation and prevention, it's that it is a truly global issue, and the mechanics of multilateral climate governance (and maybe any sort of multilateral governance) are just too weak and ineffective as it stands.

This is a very complex matter involving notions of sovereignty and the rights thereof, self-determination of nations, and adherence to international law amongst other things. For example, treaties. As far as UN negotiations go, treaties are where the framework in international law for climate responsibility is set. The 2018 Paris Agreement, for instance. That enshrined into international law exactly the sort of political responsibility you speak of. However, all it takes is one regressive administration to decide they are being burdened unfairly and withdraw from the agreement, and the whole accord is jeopardised. Indeed that is what happened in 2018 when the US withdrew. I believe it was a similar reason that the US did not join the Kyoto Accord in the '90s, too. 

The US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement represented a shirking of both its first and second-order governmental responsibility to climate change mitigation and prevention. But as well as that, the UN, as the body of multilateral governance, was unable to prevent the US withdrawing from the Paris Agreement because it facilitated unilateral withdrawal, and the correct procedure for withdrawal was followed. Although even if it wasn't, the most that could have be done would have been sanctions, and I doubt a that would have happened anyway. In essence, legally mandated regulations still require voluntary adherence, and this is problematic because it renders them subject to political whim.

The broader issue with multilateral climate governance and bodies like the UN is that it is stifled by too many considerations tangential to the matter at hand. It's an ethical quagmire to determine who has responsibility for what, and who should bear what portion of the cost for climate change mitigation and prevention. Should the cost be borne more by those who contribute the most to emissions, or should it be determined by who has the greatest ability to pay? What about those most vulnerable to climate change, shouldn't they have the loudest voice? Who gets to decide? What if nations are unwilling to contribute? What level of perceived harm or sacrifice are we willing to accept in climate change mitigation and prevention? Their second-order responsibility is barely even gotten to before other political issues arise. What's more, consider the political influence of transnational corporations. If a large transnational corporation domiciled in one nation is creating environmental issues in a second, host-nation, to which nation does the responsibility of enforcing regulation fall? There may be a strong intuition as to which, but arguing the case is never easy and resistance is always met. That matter is compounded by differing regulations between nations, as well as by the transnational corporations themselves sometimes having greater economic power than the host-nation itself. The host-nation may be unwilling or unable to enforce any regulation if doing so entails damaging their economic prosperity by having the transnational pull out. And so on. It's a mess.

To return to the corporate sector, the main reason in my view that it has a responsibility to climate mitigation, as well as stakeholder interests more broadly, is that is has the economic power, reach, and the overall logistical capacity to transcend the problems brought about by the shortcomings of multilateral and even just domestic governance. We saw an example of this when the US withdrew from the Paris Agreement, and the 'we are still in' movement emerged in corporate America.

It's not that governments shouldn't be responsible for regulating these matters, it's that it does not follow from the notion of a governmental second-order responsibility that the corporate sector does not have a first-order responsibility of its own.",[],0

713,gzm7rnu,2021-05-27,t3_nluvff,investing,"I work in data and analytics at a Media company and use Snowflake every day in my work.

I’m bullish on Snowflake because it is BY FAR, the best data warehousing product on the market by a mile. 

Most other data warehousing products out there cost a TON to use (look up teradata - they’ve struggled to grow revenue the past few years) - by cost a ton I’m meaning implementation fees alone can range in the millions of dollars, effectively locking anyone but the biggest of companies out from using their product.

Snowflake on the other hand is cheap. It’s not a SAAS product, you don’t pay subscription fees to use it. Instead, you purchase credits from snowflake (this is the $1.4B in future revenue that they already have booked), and consume these credits to run queries, import data etc into Snowflake. 

Using credits to do our day to day work explains why Snowflakes revenue retention rate is so high. Customers, like us, are constantly querying the data in our data warehouse to update business dashboards, pull reports etc. This data normally needs to be refreshed at least daily, if not multiple times a day. Every time a query is refreshed Snowflake makes money.

Given how easy it is to import data from a variety of sources, the number of business intelligence developers that we’ve employed has increased 5x because the business sees such value in a platform. No longer does it takes days or weeks to import data into Snowflake, you can have clean, transformed and ready to use data, pushing that into your business dashboards, in a matter of hours. As we move more reports away from being manual and done in excel to being automated and powered by Snowflake, our cost to use the product naturally increases over time.

The reason why I am bullish on Snowdlake is because there target market is SO LARGE. They have under 5000 customers WORLDWIDE, who use their product. For reference, the media company I work for is SMALL (i’m based in New Zealand), and we probably spend roughly 30k per year on Snowflake for all our data warehousing needs.

Think of mega cap companies, like Coca Cola, Walmart, Home Depot etc and think about the VOLUME of data that they have! Billions of rows of operational data that is ONLY INCREASING OVER TIME. Think of the number of disparate systems - CRM, accounting, billing, procurement etc, and think about the need for having this data in a place where analysts across a business can query one place for the business source of truth.

Think also about how the amount of data over time is only going to increase as become more of an interconnected world - IOT, more data being consumed over the internet, automated cars, robots - all are going to require that data to be stored somewhere and used at a later date - that’s what Snowflake does.

Literally, they could stop growing their customer numbers and their revenue would still grow 60%+ per year as their existing customers become more integrated with the warehouse and query it more and more.

From a technical perspective, sure they’re competing against the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google, but these products are SHIT compared to the godliness of Snowflake. Literally, the ability to query 320million rows of data in a query in Snowflake that takes 6 minutes to run vs 6 HOURS in Azure.

As a professional in the industry, I will not promote any product other than Snowflake to a future business that I work for if they don’t yet have a data warehouse. This is only going to amplify over time as the people using the product become the spokespeople for it - because Snowflake is THAT GOOD.

So yes, from an investment perspective, Snowflake is HELLA expensive. 60x TTM sales is ridiculous, regardless of the growth rate of the company. However, if you begin to consider the total number of customers that can use them (because their revenue is usage rather than subscription based, both large and small customers can easily use them -  no other product allows for this), the fact that data levels are only going to increase over time, and the fact that their product is clearly superior to everything else on the market, you can see why they are valued so richly.

When William Mark decided to get back into investing after the 2008 financial crisis, he looked past stocks and bonds. Needing to play catch-up with his retirement portfolio, the piping engineer decided to bet on a complicated product he hoped would deliver double-digit annual returns.

It worked so well—earning him 18% a year in dividends, on average—that he eventually poured $800,000 into the investments, called leveraged exchange-traded notes, or ETNs. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, he lost almost every penny.

“I’m 67 years old and I’m basically bankrupt in just two weeks,” Mr. Mark said. (https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bankrupt-in-just-two-weeks-individual-investors-get-burned-by-collapse-of-complex-securities/ar-BB14STeh?li=BBnb7Kz)",[],0

When I start adding up the bills with my internet expense, I pay a lot for access to content. I can't tell you the last time I watched something on Netflix. My kids use it but they also have Disney +. Being that their children, if Netflix suddenly stopped working they would find something else and one of the other streaming sites we pay for. So when I start going down the list of where can I cut, Netflix always takes the top spot. The only problem is I have other people who use my membership because they are leeches. At this point, the price of the subscription is not high enough in order for me to pull that trigger, but I'm on the edge there. If Netflix raises the price again I am probably not going to stay on. If Netflix suddenly needs to earn more fees because their subscription base flattens out or their content cost increase how many people will jump ship because a price increase those are justify the subscription of a service that is surpassed by other services in terms of use.",[],0

Stock futures are down a bit, with tech stocks leading the drop. Nasdaq off about 0.4%. S&P 500 about 0.2% lower. Dow Industrials down about 0.1%. That’s as of 0630.

This follows a pretty quiet day on Wall Street, with some muted gains. Disappointing earnings from Nvidia and Snowflake after the bell appear to be weighing on sentiment now, especially for tech stocks. This is preventing a breakout.

Bunch of economic data releases this morning that people will be watching in anticipation of a Fed adjustment to interest rate policy.

These all drop at 0830: Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) prices are the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation. Core prices are expected to have increased by 2.3% in Q1, the same as in Q4. If that number beats the upside then watch out for inflation and tapering talk. 

Durable goods orders should shed some light on supply chain constraints as well as demand from manufacturers. Expectations are for 0.8% print for core orders, down from the 2.3% level in March. 

It’s Thursday, so we also get initial jobless claims. Economists are expecting another post-pandemic low there, of 425k. That’s a slight drop from 444k reported last week. 

There’s also a GDP print, but I don’t care about that as it’s entirely backward looking and has no impact on future direction of pretty much anything.

Most people like only roughly 1% of TV and film content ever produced. Knowing this, the subjectivity of it, and the unimaginably varied taste humans have, logic dictates that the optimal strategy is to produce as much content as you possibly can, therein doing two main things:

1. You keep your subscribers subscribed because they’re always looking forward to new content (or sequels). 

2. You have the breadth of varied content and the more content the more things comprise that 1% of things people like.  

I also want to add that while I like things on the other streaming services and I’m a fan of all of them, this strategy has created the most good things on Netflix, by far. They also enjoy the best app design, and highest quality streaming.

Whether im right idk its just a theory I came up with looking at the charts a week ago. I found it curious the in that right around the time BTC was starting to rally was right around the same time all the indexes started to have corrections similar to what we have been seeing this year and right as BTC topped off and fell off a cliff was right around the time the 2018 correction found a bottom. Seems like the same thing that happened over this week. So I think once regulation comes in and they have to report what cryptos they are buying and selling people will realize who is actually pumping and dumping.

There are still some strong moves happening in smaller names, but they are looking more like basing patterns that need more time than true breakouts. I was really hoping to see price action like when stocks broke out on these examples:


Toward the end of a consolidation in November last year the Nasdaq shot up to the top of the range in just two days. There was more volatility after that and a slow breakout, but the move set the stage for higher prices.

In February 2000 the Nasdaq reached it previous highs in four days. From there, it consolidated and broke out higher into a final bubble top.

Moves like these keep traders who couldn’t buy in before on the sidelines. It also makes people who bought late wary of a correction. This has been another good move, but is looking more like another fake out like we’ve seen so many times since February.

The people on this sub are way to cynical about anything that is new such as Acorns and even crypto. This sub shits on crypto all day, but it’s here to stay now.

Looking at their site now, it doesn't even look like you can choose your own positions to average into, just there plans.

993,gzmys4a,2021-05-27,t3_nm7wkg,investing,"Ok, so a company has a market capitalization, essentially, how much it is worth on the market. Market capitalization is found by the number of shares outstanding multiplied by the stock price. So if a company has stock worth $50 a share and has 100 million shares outstanding, the company is worth 5 billion dollars on the market. Now let's say that the market cap stays at that 5 billion and the company issues 150 million new shares. That would bring the total amount of shares outstanding to 250 million. To get the new stock price, you would divide the market cap (5 billion) by 250 million. The new share price would be $20. Regarding tesla, they did  stock split, which is different from a dilution. In a stock split, the number of shares is simply multiplied by whatever number and the share price is divided by that number. Those holding stock in the company would not lose money because their number of shares would be multiplied, so if you held 1 tesla share at 2000 before the stock split, you would get 5 at 400 because they did a 5:1 split. This boosted their share price since many people wanted to buy tesla and not many trading platforms allow for fractional shares.
