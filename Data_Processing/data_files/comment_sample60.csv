Your trading app should show you cost basis (the amount you bought the option(s) for) and the current price of the options. If the option is in the green, you may want to sell for a profit unless you're very confident that the stock will be above $30 + the amount you paid for the option if you bought it OTM (since the extrinsic value of an option drains away as it reaches the expiration date).

Congrats on just risking $20 for your first option instead of risking a huge amount. It might even be worth watching the option's value for the next couple weeks to see what happens when the price goes up/down, and how time value decay reduces the option's value as it gets closer to expiry.

With options, remember you're trading on the likelyhood of the contract expiring in the money. Sometimes a bonkers options contract that realistically won't ever be ITM will go up in price because the likelyhood of ITM at expiry has increased from 0.001% to 0.01%. That's why you may see far OTM options gain value for a short time if a stock rockets up.",[],0

It'll cause massive power outages.  The electricity needed to charge everything comes at a cost too.  Maybe green power will be enough, but judging from the winter storm this year and how the grid failed.  I have my doubts.  

Also, there will be major supply issues with sourcing batteries and disposing them.  Unless something revolutionary in the battery tech comes along.  Elon has been promissing that.  He also said he'd have a truck and semi.  So far other auto manufacturers filled that market.  Ford F150, Hyundai Semis.  Some big companies talk of going all electric but its just lip service, there are way too many ICE for the time being.  

I could post a ton of links and go on and on.. I'll just post some if you are really interested in this topic.  Sorry I have to go do something afk

And yes, Google is great, but sometimes I just like to have acquire knowledge via conversation rather than blog posts or YouTube. 

To further understand, I’d like to ask about the typical criteria that I’d fill up when buying options. 

- let’s say a stock is currently at $10
- and I think that in 1 year (or sooner), the price will be $20
- i could buy 100 shares today, and if I’m right, then I’ll double my money when it reaches $20. 
- but that’s also risky, because my confidence isn’t 100%. 
- therefore i choose a less-risky alternative: “call options”
- each “call” comes in bundles of 100, no more, no less. So 2 calls would be 200. 
- i pay a premium of $0.50 per share. For 1 call, that’s 100 shares, each at $0.50 premium, totaling a cost of $50.  The most money I can lose is $50. 
- when buying, I choose the expiration date.  Extending the date is doable, but will cause the premium to go up. 
- so lets say 6 months down the line, my contract is only halfway to expiration.  And the price went up 50% (from $10 to $15). So it hasn’t doubled (yet).  But now I’m getting cold feet and paper hands. I have the right to exercise my option to buy the stocks now at $10/share (even though market value is $15). 
- my profit is now 50% of my principal investment, minus the $50 cost of premium. 
- but after exercising the call, im still simply holding stocks, not cash.  In order to claim the money, i need to sell those stocks. 

Do i have all of the correct?",[],0

2885,gzsejlb,2021-05-28,t1_gzsafpv,wallstreetbets,"1.  It's all a gamble. Some people buy in the money calls, some people buy out of the money calls.  Making up numbers, but let's say that the stock is currently trading at $15 a share...and let's say a $14.50 call is $1.60.    In reality, if you buy the call, and then exercise it, it actually cost you $16.10 per share ($14.50 plus the $1.60 premium).  But you are less likely for the contract to expire worthless. The same stock trading at $15 a share, you can buy a $17 call for $0.59.  So the break-even point becomes $17.59.   if the expiration date for this call is 2 months out, and later the stock is trading at $16 a share, now the contract is worth more than 59 cents....so you can sell the contract at a profit.   Better yet, during those two months the stock goes to $33 a share. You could exercise the contract and purchase 100 shares for $1,500...and turn around and sell them for $3,300.  Or you can sell the contract for a gross profit, without exercising it.  

So I guess it comes down to how much you believe in the stock going up in value, and how much you're willing to gamble on that happening. 

2. Contract price is chosen by the person selling the contract. Of course just like a stock, a contract isn't going to sell for a price that the market does not dictate.   That is, nobody's going to pay a dollar for a contract that everybody else is selling for 0.59.  So you could say the market sets the price, or you could say the seller sets the price, but I guess it's kind of a combination of the two.

3. You need to be approved by your brokerage firm to be able to purchase contracts. At least that's how it works for me with Charles Schwab.  I said an application in, and they still did not approve me for the level that I wanted... So I called them up and the person I talked to play 20 questions with me, once they knew that I understood options, they approved me for the level that I wanted.  I know that doesn't really answer your question, but is the first step to being able to trade options.  There really isn't a minimum or a maximum for options trading.  Looking at amc, the calls that expire a week from now, very in price from $1.29, to $29 (realize that the $1.29 contract is going to cost $129, and the $29 contract is going to cost $2,900 to purchase).  The vary based on the strike price that you select and the expiration date. If you pick a strike price, and then look at the same strike price that expires at a later date, the price will be higher.  But this starts to get into intrinsic and extrinsic values, that you would probably be better off learning by watching a YouTube video.  Anyhow, the extrinsic value of a call option would decay as the option gets closer to expiring.  So with nothing else changing, the value of the option decreases day by day.  So as a general rule, options that expire sooner, have less extrinsic value...",[],0

If $butthole hits the breakeven price or any price above that I can sell the call at any time and take the profits? So if $butthole = $5000 before January 2022, I get $5000 x 100 shares if I sell. Is that right?

Every share purchased is identical and equal, with all the rights of ownership attached. Hedge funds have short sold countless millions of rehypothecated (copies/IOUs) shares. The longer they continue to do this (meaning, the longer we all keep buying and diamond hand HODLing GME), the more they bleed out, and are eventually margin called, then liquidated. When this happens, they'll have to cover their short positions - which will be impossible, due to retail apes owning the entire float MULTIPLE times over, who are refusing to sell. But, because at that point, the shorts will be covered automatically at any price, the apes can name their insane, impossible-sounding price.


Now, if a unique, non-replicable dividend is given to all shareholders, the amount of that dividend created for circulation will be the amount of shares in the float.

Brokers will be FORCED to recall all of their shorts, so that all synthetics can be destroyed, and they're able to distribute the dividend.",['GME'],0

I don't believe I would ever exercise a call option.  But speaking in general concepts, you would never exercise a call option unless the value of the stock increased beyond the strike price, and you were better off exercising the option as compared to buying the stock on the market.  

Let's say you bought a $16 call on a stock that is trading at $16, and paid a premium of a dollar.  That means the call option cost you $100.  But also means that your breakeven point is now $17 a share ($16 strike price, plus the $1 premium).  So if you bought the option, and then turned around and exercised it, you would lose money.  Let's say that the stock price increased to $17 a share.  Now you're at your break-even point, and that if you exercised the contract which you got from each share would total the premium plus the strike price.  But let's say that contract would now sell for $1.25.You would actually be better off selling the contract to close then you would to exercise the contract.  If you exercise it, you would break even. If you sold the contract, you would make $0.25 a share, or $25 for every contract that you purchased and then sold.  As you get closer to the expiration date, there is normally less money to be made by selling the contract...but it is still normally better than exercising it.  So as an example, for this $16 call, if the share price increased to $20, the contract would sell for more than $4. So you would be better off selling the contract, as compared to exercising it.

Now just to make sure you understand, exercising a contract is something that you would do after you purchase it. Once you purchase a contract, if you exercise it, you then are buying the shares, 100 shares, at the strike price.  So using my example above, if you exercise this contract with a strike price of $16, you are going to be buying 100 shares for $1,600... No matter what the share is selling for in the open market, that contract with a $16 strike, can be exercised for $16 a share.

If you meant, when you said ""exercise,"" to purchase a call... Yes, you would only want to purchase a call on a stock that you believed was going to increase in value.  If you believe the stock was going to go down in value, you would want to purchase a put.  If the stock trades sideways, you're going to lose money, because the extrinsic value of the call option is going to decrease as it gets closer to the expiration date...being worth zero at the expiration date.",[],0

4250,gzshe1y,2021-05-28,t1_gzrraz4,wallstreetbets,"I don't know anything other than what is publicly available to anyone. Despite wild swings that can take place in a share price, in the end the fundamentals win the day. In the early days it is more subjective. Financial analysts work for IBs and not for the actual company they are researching. Yes sometimes both the company in question (like BB) and the IB are on the same side of the table BUT sometimes they are not. Financial analysts are not motivated to make bold calls or be subjective. They may eventually show up but usually much later, at which point the share price has likely appreciated quite a bit. They generally look for certainty. But one does not have to wait for the money to be on the books to know it’s coming. To make this point, 10 years ago FB had a user base of 50 million and NO revenues. Yet MSFT invested $246 million for a tiny stake valuing FB at $15 billion. This is not a crazy analogy becasue QNX has a user base of over 175 million. And IVY will have the ability to tap that. BB also has revenues. Using $15 billion equates to about $27 USD per share for BB. What if we used 175 million ? At the time many thought MSFT was crazy but today that $246 million would be worth $20 billion or 75x more. You suggest no financial analysts have a buy rating (most are SELL/HOLD). If this is the case, you can ask yourself, or the institutions in question, why are 50% plus of the BB shares held by institutions. Many of these are considered world class and very savvy. Allianz hold almost a quarter of a $ billion in shares when no analysts are recommending BB ? Why ? Because they do their own research (as you, or I or anyone should) and understand that IB analysst and IBs are not working for you and I or them. There are other reasons as well but kind of sums it up. Hope this was helpful.",[],1

This is a stock that has been building support slowly and inching up a little here and a little there. Not like AMC where you have no clue the price on Monday because the price movement implies a high degree of irrational behavior unrelated to any fundamentals (tried shorting AMC and closed the position for a small $2,800 loss... could have kept it open a little longer and closed out with no loss, but decided to get out of it as no real desire to find out how irrational investors can be).

In any case, I digress, if you are looking for a stock that has a lot of upwards potential, especially as the quarters pass and we get more insight into the revenue potential from their drugs, then look at BCRX. Shares always the safest play as you can avoid timing  the market that way, but LEAPs might be a good play as well. Of course being wsb, you probably want to gamble on sharp weekly movements, so you can do that as well (this past week would have worked out nicely).",['AMC'],0

4603,gzsi93d,2021-05-28,t1_gzrpfy3,wallstreetbets,"You generally don't want to exercise, especially far from expiration. Part of an option contracts value is based on how much time it has left until expiration and the current Implied Volatility (IV) of the contract. These 2 things are known as extrinsic value, and are completely lost when the contract is exercised. As you get closer to expiration time value decays more and more until it hits zero at expiry. Basically you very rarely want to exercise contracts, especially ones far out in expiration. 

Some of this time value (often called Theta) goes away faster and faster each day closer to expiration, and really speeds up the last 30-45 days before expiration. This is called theta decay and it's a reason you often do not want to hold your calls until expiration unless you're very confident it'll go up even more.

So I'd generally recommend selling at least 30-45 days before expiration, and preferably when your contracts Implied Volatility (IV) is high. IV estimates how much the underlying stock will move in the future. If it's really low then not much move is expected and it's less likely your contracts will get ITM. If it's very high then it's expecting the possibility of very large moves in the underlying, which would make the contract more likely to get ITM. 

Now of course a super important metric in rather you should sell or not is the stock price. AMC is very weird because it's unpredictable. It might spike even higher tomorrow and you could make way more, or maybe it'll drop back towards where it's been, which would crush the IV and lower the value a lot. In my opinion i would sell considering you're up like 500% which is insane gains honestly. But I'm better at learning theoretical stuff than i am at actually trading, and with how wild AMC is, it's very hard to judge. I just think greed is very hard to get passed, and when you see huge gains your brain likes it and wants more. Basically you have to decide if the risk of keeping it is worth potentially losing all of these gains.

Another thing you could do is sell one of the contracts which should recoup the amount of money you paid for both contracts, so even if the other call becomes completely worthless you already covered your entry fee and hopefully made a little profit as well. 

Last thing, you can roll your calls. If you think they might be worth even more but you want more time value you can sell your calls and in the same trade buy 2 new calls further out in expiration. This works best when IV is high, because the further out in time the lower IV goes, so you'll sell your contract with a high IV and buy back a new one with lower (but still high) IV. For example, right now you could sell the Sept 17th 15c for 15.45 and then buy the Dec 17th 15c for 15.88, so you get 3 more months and more time value for 42 dollars. 

What I would do is at least sell one to recoup what you paid, and then do whatever u want with your ""free"" contract.",['AMC'],0

It's the most important part of the equation. Ignore it at your peril. 

>How can a city support charging all BEVs. It'll cause massive power outages. The electricity needed to charge everything comes at a cost too.

The national grid in the US needs serious upgrades. Perfect time for a ""New Deal"" for the American people, no? Maybe a new deal that aims to be energy efficient and unchained from the uncertainties and waste of the petroleum economy--what do you think?

Besides the obvious benefits of cheap, clean energy by a massive investment in PV, wind, etc., there are vast amounts of good paying jobs that can largely absorb the employment force of the oil/fracking companies and create thousands of private companies as well. 

A lot of people are still holding onto the petroleum model, but we're already past that as the primary energy source. Nobody wants to touch another drop of oil if they don't have to. Is that where you're coming from? Nostalgic for dragsters and muscle cars and the smell of burning fuel? I get that. Really. Been wrenching on bikes mostly, but it relaxes me to take experiment with carburetor jet sizes to get the right burn. 

But the battery tech is undeniable. And it's a decade ahead of H2. Plus, the EVs don't need extensive infrastructure investment compared to H2. The wires are already run, just need the charging stations. Not cheap, but not anywhere near the expense of H2 storage/piping/transport.

Seems we have to agree to disagree, but my money is where my mouth is. Dinosaur tech will produce questionable returns when there's an obviously better tech that at price parity.",[],0

If anything, best case scenario (which you got) this was gonna sell off to the upper bollinger and use that as support, for today at least.

If you're truly bearish on it, you should have bought a few weeks out, as overall market could very likely correct 10%+ over June/July.

Personally I'm just in SPXS, because I'm not CONVINCED of a correction, I just think one is likely. Stop loss a few dollars above SPY's old highs. Easy risk-reward play.

Of course this isn't the WSB way, I've done tons of retarded trades like yours. I think 1 / 100 worked out, but overall I lost 10s of $1000s doing weekly or 0DTE low-chance-of-happening puts... Almost always puts... I'd have won millions if all those trades were calls instead.

Its wrong, markets shouldn't be here, Dow should be 15k or less and just starting to creep up now due to re-opening. But I've come to learn the markets are *completely* fake, engineered to make the elites maximum gains and tricks plebs in with FOMO, then they'll pull the plug because the next few years are obviously going to be god awful economically... This is just their scheme of putting most of those losses over to retail, and then Wall Street will buy the BIG dip (50%+) when it happens. If they don't have dry powder, the Fed will give them several trillion printed out of thin air to buy the dip at the most opportune time.

If they expire in the money, your contracts will be exercised at the appropriate strikes, so you will end up owning shares (number of contracts times 100) if what you expired was call options. 

If they expire out of the money, you loose all the money you already invested in those contracts, ie the premium you paid for them. 

To note here, if you do not have the capital to pay for shares if your contracts are exercised, your broker will automatically liquidate the contracts some time before market close on the expiration date. 

Another important note and why it is important to know that options expire a couple hours after market close is because, as you are (probably?) aware, trading still takes place after market close; therefore, your contracts can go in the money (and out of the money) even after market closed for the week. This distinction is especially important to recognize if you are the one selling options.

Really though, just google shit and learn on your own. You are more likely to get incorrect or incomplete information here because, while there are many people with wealth of knowledge and understanding, there are also many people like you with insufficient knowledge (or no knowledge at all) and some of them, for some reason, will gladly “answer” your questions instead of shutting the fuck up and learning themselves.

Inflation is an expansion. Prices don't expand, they go up and down. Money supply expands and contracts. Inflation = money supply expansion. The government obfuscated this real definition and began conflating it with the symptom of inflation, which are rising prices. 

Also, just because prices weren't increasing at a higher rate over the last decade doesn't mean the inflation of the supply of money didn't have a negative impact. It did. We should have had a decade of declining prices, but the Fed blocked that economic cycle with inflation (money supply expansion). 

Ultimately, in the end, we will most likely get the crack up boom and price rise conflagration that you confuse inflation with.",[],0

Even if you don’t believe in the “squeeze” you can still believe that silver is undervalued and offers wealth preservation independent of banks and governments.

Even a conservative allocation of metals in one’s portfolio is 10%. Invest in silver because you want to be diversified. Or invest in silver because you want to be part of something bigger. 

The wealthy think they have all the power. It’s like poker where they get to see everyone’s cards, and if they start to lose, they change the rules (like with Robinhood and GameStop). Does your “one vote” not matter? Buy silver, show the powers that be that we have the power to move markets.",[],0

Times are about to change. We found their weak-spot and now they can finally feel the anger piling onto their endless buttomline.

In this example, $59 per contract gives you the right but, not the obligation to buy 100 shares @ $17 by expiration. For a 17C ($17 strike, Call option), the break-even, in this case, would then be $17.59. (strike + premium) so, if the stock price goes above 17.59 you make money, either by a) selling a 17C and collecting the difference in premiums or b) exercising the option (buying 100 shares @ 17) and selling them and banking the profit (or holding that's your choice).  The risk in this scenario is the premium you paid for the contract so, $59. If the price doesn't go above 17.59, you would not exercise and the contract would expire worthlessly and you forfeit the $59",[],0

The wife and I have been in for £12,000 since January after the first spike with a cost average of $250 dollars. We'd missed two other opportunities to pass and although the money wasn't anything we couldn't afford to lose, it was disheartening to keep falling into the trap of seeing it go positive and not exiting at or above. 

So yesterday I finally managed to get us out at $259. The price went up to $263 and the wife had that initial dread again that had trapped us before, I.e ""what if it still goes up?"" but I was absolutely determined to ignore it.

Thank fuck we got proven correct today and I hit it at the peak. I'll absolutely reinvest but I've already told myself I'm not touching it again unless it's at least sub $130.  

Good luck to anyone still in, I hope you get made millionaires but for me I'm done with it for now. Happy wife again 👍",['GME'],0
