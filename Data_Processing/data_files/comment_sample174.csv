Those gains don’t tell the whole story however, as this week has seen a marked reversal in risk appetite. The Nasdaq is up 2% for the week, with the S&P up about 1%. Companies like Boeing, Ford, Roblox, AMC, and GameStop have seen dramatic rallies.

We have a couple of economic reports today that could shed more light on consumer spending and inflation. The Personal Income and consumer spending reports and PCE Core Price Index, the Fed’s preferred gauge for inflation, are out at 0830. Expectations on the PCE are for a 2.9% year-over-year print for April.

We also have Chicago PMIs out at 0945. Last month saw a record (I think) 72.1 reading. Expectations for this month are for 68. Obviously both of these readings are well above the 50 level separating expansion from contraction.

Happy early Memorial Day! Forecasts are for a huge surge in travel this weekend. (60% YoY increase, according to AAA). This means two things: 1) If you haven’t left by now you will hit traffic. Put that in the books And 2) The pandemic appears to be well and truly over and reopening in full effect. So it makes sense for risk assets to be pushing higher again.",['AMC'],0

In my bull case the price shoots up to PLN 400 over the next 4 years and in the worst case it goes down to PLN 100 (+100% vs -41%). High risk, high reward suitable for my own risk tolerance.

There are a couple of catalyst this year that will help this stock:  
\- Next gen release of the Witcher 3 to PS5 / Series X / PC  
\- Next gen release of Cyberpunk 2077 to PS5 and Series X

And they are currently transforming CDPR to develop The Witcher 4 and Cyberpunk 2077 sequel at the same time. So they will be able to launch titles in shorter timeframes.  
The Development team of CD Projekt RED is extremely passionate about creating games and you can follow the stream from Pawel Sasko every sunday where he goes to the development process of Cyberpunk 2077.

  
We are at a point in the gaming industry where the publishers are trying to maximize profits by overmonetizing games and focussing on mobile games.  
And that true triple A development is becoming less lucrative.  
The big dogs that understand Triple A development are buying the gaming studio's dedicated at creating these titles looking at you Sony, Microsoft (if you want to be safe, invest here).   
And the big publishers are starting to dissappear from this space except for the ones that are playing close attention to providing value at consumers, looking at you Capcom.  


Capcom is focussed on deliverying value to the customer after playing around with overmonetizing DLC etc.. This is noticeable in their huge succes from the latest years (resident evil 8 launch, Final Fantasy remake etc.) and their stock is being rewarded for this.  
As a small cap gaming studio: CDPR that is focussed on providing value to the customer with a passionate development time behind this, I am confident in placing a long term bet here.",[],1

1759,gzqv5e5,2021-05-28,t1_gzpz0ic,wallstreetbets,"I’ve read all of their 8Ks, listened to their past several earnings calls, and I keep a model. I typed this on my phone so unfortunately so I didn’t get to be as detailed as I wanted.

They previously had EBITDA covenants which they breached. I believe they refinanced last year for this very reason. In fact, they’ve already breached their current covenants by going under $20M during 1Q. That’s why it’s been revised down to $15M.

The company enjoyed a pretty strong pull-forward in demand last year, but it wasn’t positioned to capitalized on it. They were already in a state of making the business lean and they didn’t have the resources to drive improvements in retention, rates. They were also hit by labor shortages, which caused increases in opex and further prevented the realization of operating leverage.

I don’t view dilution here as a major negative. When you bet on micro caps, you’re essentially betting a person is going to drive a turnaround in a broken business, and that’s what this is. We need flexibility to be able to focus on the growth initiative without being saddled by that debt. Oh, and before you waste time on the 8K, it’s $15M at all times and over 320K customers. There are also a bunch of warrants associated with the offering (dilutive), at $0.01 per share. Again, bad signs.

Look at HelloFresh. It started smaller than Blue Apron and it’s now a $15B company with high top-line growth rates. The negative risk factors for blue apron, low competitive moat, low switching cost, etc extend to them, so a campaign focused on low margin customer acquisition would be effective.

Regarding timing, I’ll save you some extra effort, as it’ll also have to be soon. They’re within the danger zone assuming their current cash burn remains constant. They’ve resolved many of their labor cost issues that drove expenses last year, so they estimate $2M at least will drop off the burn, but we’ll see what actual impact it had in August. Anyway, they’re coming up on headwinds from reopening reducing demand with more people wanting to travel and they’re also facing the worst seasonality for margins given the challenges of shipping perishable goods across the nation during the warmest months of the year.

This isn’t a “wait and see what happens” deal, it’s a near-term event where it’s either going under, or they’re going to find a way to continue on. I think it’s likely that, if they can continue to grow the customer base, they’re able to successfully execute on a strategic alternative. The fact is, I don’t think they’re going to be able to refi the debt or issue enough equity as the current conditions stand. Maybe they can find someone to do a PIPE offering, or ATM, but I think they’re going to be in a position where they sell to a better capitalized business. A big reason I believe this is that they’re so close to that cash covenant (again), but they’re still full throttle on growth. Usually a company in this stage would be aggressively trimming costs down to the bone, unless there was a reason not to be concerned. If you see any off-cycle sell-side research from Maria or Brian (or better yet a new analyst) that’s also a good clue that banking activity is up.

IMO- you can’t use traditional fundamentals to judge a micro cap stock. That’s how it got here. At this point it’s more prudent to use mosaic theory and anecdotal evidence as to how it can come back and what form that would take. The fundamentals totally point to bankruptcy, you’re right, but look at their announcement in Feb 2020 and compare it to their actions today. You’ll see the prior reflects a company preparing to die and the more recent implies something different.",[],0

With enough people using them, the squeeze doesn’t happen and stocks continue status quo for hedge funds and retail(you and I) gets screwed yet again.

Then we see more pictures of the elites sipping champagne and laughing at us from their balconies, this time wiping fake tears with $100 bills. They will have won forever since regulations are being put into place to prevent large squeezes like this ever again.

GME is transitioning from retail to e-commerce and theyve just announced a NFT based project that's likely going to be used to enable transferring ownership of digital games, opening a new market!

GME on fundamentals alone has the chance to go to $750 a share (or 50 bil valuation).

GME has a higher short interest, an all-star team board of directors, a bright future, the saga of DFV, Ryan Cohen.

Citadel is long on AMC

GME is debt free, and has close to 750 million cash whereas AMC is heavily in debt

AMCs CEO is heavily connected to Wallstreet

AMC has diluted their shares heavily.

GME on fundamentals alone has the chance to go to $750 a share (or 50 bil valuation).

GME has a higher short interest, an all-star team board of directors, a bright future, the saga of DFV, Ryan Cohen.

Calls are bets that the stock will hit your strike price, giving you the option to buy 100 shares at your strike price. 

Example: I bought gme 200$ strike calls and gme is trading at 260 and climbing. I have the right to buy 100 shares of gme at $200 each, giving me a profit of $6000 and climbing. Options expire as well while shares don’t so it’s risky but the rewards are higher. Honestly if you can buy a lot of shares, do that. If you are poor like me options are a great way to get similar gains as you. You do run the risk of losing what you put in though.",[],0

Their pipeline has shown tremendous potential in combination therapies for a variety of cancers including breast and fatal skin cancers for people with MDS.

This is all after a Guggenheimer analyst recently upgraded from .61c to $4.00 was overshadowed by a 1:15 reverse split to maintain exchange compliance rules. Stock plummeted afterwards and short interest is holding small dedicated folks who believe in the company holding the bag.

In 18 months they'll creep back up (3-4-5%) and not only will nobody be refinancing, people will be chained to their houses with golden, unassumable mortgages. If you bought a $300k house at 2.5% and you decide you need something different but the rates have moved up to 5%, you'd have to find a house worth $220k or less in order to have the same payment. 

Once this boom is over, I think we're going to see most of the US housing prices roll over into a 5-15% recessed value with a very flat valuation for 6-10 years. You'll be able to move, but it will cost you a lot more every month so there will be fewer people ""moving up"". The prices won't appreciate nearly as fast, so your equity will stagnate. It won't be enough to break the banks - the people they're lending to can cover the payments - and nobody is going to panic sell or default so the lending insurance market will chug along (and possibly do better as more people will be stuck with PMI for longer).

https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/maintain-short-position-delisted-stock/
A company doesn’t go bankrupt JUST because of short selling, but short sellers(large firms not everyday retail) have a damn good reason to make shareholders continue to sell off, ultimately hurting the company via stock price. Then the short sellers have no shares to buy back. Free money basically. 
As seen with GME and AMC, shareholders investing in a company can bring them out of debt and completely turn a business around. Now the massive firms betting on their demise have become opposite bag holders and want this stock to fail. 

How’s that for a brain dead take?

Regulations are being put into place as we speak by officials. You think I, a nobody, have any say in a financial system that has been taking advantage of stocks for decades? Firms have been fined millions of dollars and it’s nothing compared to the billions they make. 
And I am doing what I can by holding these stocks and helping my new found friends fight back. 

I’d say anyone taking the time to discuss their opinion on an open forum cares enough to be heard. I’m listening, and I’d love to hear a real reason as to why you oppose this. If millions of people lose money, what’s it to you? People, collectively, lost more than that last year.","['GME', 'AMC']",0

Everybody starts somewhere. The stars look good. Just remember that you have to sell that call or have the $3000 to exercise it and buy the stock at the end of the day (and you need to tell your broker to do so). 

Me? If I had a $30c? I'd ride that SOB as hard as possible today and then cash it out mid-afternoon and buy a 7/2 put with half the winnings at about $5-7 below the current strike, or wherever the gamma tails off. 

Note: I will be downvoted for cutting against the surge, but this will be a bubble and it will pop. That's not saying AMC isn't a good play long term (tho I'm not a theater fan, personally), but in 24 months I would expect the value to be in the $20-24 range, tops, unless there's a substantial shift in their business model.

There's a steady steady stream of catalysts coming, and 48 new tuties opens positions this last 3 weeks. A lot going on for this stock. 

Approval getting pushed back 6 weeks if not a big deal theres too much demand for the next 4 years for covid vaccines. Either way they're still producing vaccines as we speak versus Pfizer and moderna that started producing after they got approval and it took him awhile to get stockpile ready before they could give out vaccines so regardless time wise it's going to be basically the same in that regard because their stockpiling before approval so when approval comes they can hit the ground running versus when your competitors got approved they start to stumbling out the gate with manufacturing huge difference

The max you can lose when you buy a call is the premium you pay. With calls you are betting the price will go up so if the stock doesn't go up to the strike price before the expiration date, it expires worthless. You can also sell calls, if you own the underlying stock this is a ""covered call"" so you collect the premium from the contract and will have to sell the stock shares to the person buying the call at the strike price if they exercise it. There are also ""naked calls"" where you sell the call but don't own the underlying stock so if price goes above strike price you would have to buy the stock at that price then sell it at the lower strike price to the person who bought the call from you. Selling naked calls is risky because there is not limit to the potential losses as stock price can keep going up. This is the idea behind a ""gamma squeeze"", large firms sell naked calls that have very low probability of being exercised, deep Out of the Market ""OTM"", then if stock price makes a large jump, suddenly all those calls have a high probability of being exercised, so they need to purchase some of the underlying stock to minimize their risk.",[],0

This is Schwab’s minimum equity requirement to maintain a stock position in accounts that have and use the margin feature.

     AMC

     AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc

     Margin Maintenance Requirement

     Special Maintenance: 150%

If you have a special maintenance requirement on your account that is greater than the equity-specific requirement, then the account level maintenance requirement will supersede the equity-specific requirement.

Margin requirements are subject to change at any time. You must meet initial deposit requirements on all trades.

Stocks trading for less than $3.00 are not marginable.

Typically, the ongoing maintenance requirement for most stocks is 30%, but it can be much higher for volatile or lower-priced securities.

Special maintenance requirements are set at Schwab's discretion and are intended to reflect a stock's volatility and to ensure that your account maintains sufficient equity to cover large price movements. Some stocks are so volatile or illiquid that they cannot be margined.

Margin requirements may be changed due to concentrated positions, non-diversification, changes in market conditions or at Schwab's discretion.

You won't pay any tax on Roth distributions.  That's the point - you already paid tax on the contributions, so your burden is covered.  That's why a lot of high income earners do backdoor Roth IRAs.

I do both traditional and Roth accounts for tax diversification.  I do pre-tax 401k because I expect to be in a lower marginal tax bracket when I retire, so it makes sense to defer tax payments for me (and pre-tax means more principal invested).  I only do post-tax brokerage investments after I've maxed out all my tax advantaged accounts.

Choice of accounts is highly dependent on everyone's individual situation, but it's not a bad idea to have some diversification.

right now everyone wants to own a piece of AMC (or GME, or any other meme stock, but especially AMC right now).

There are only 450,000,000 shares to go around. Institutions and insiders own 30%, and short interest is 30%, so only 40% of that is available, giving ~180,000,000 shares available to retail.

One can do a quick look at bitcoin and doing some quick math there are ROUGHLY 10x the shares of AMC available as there are Bitcoin (very roughly I know but it's easy to calculate).

Given that, if AMC has a similar level of retail hype as Bitcoin and demand is strong, price can easily reach Bitcoin's price divided by 10, giving a price per share of around $3500/share.

Now earlier I said these calculations were very rough and they are, so to be conservative just cut that in half and you get $1750/share.

This is purely based on supply and demand, because retail investors do not care about valuation right now. They simply want shares.","['GME', 'AMC']",0

Yesterday I discovered you can use your instant deposit (from your regular bank account) on RH to flip an option quick — and then cancel that deposit keeping your profits (at least if you have the RH bank account set up and are not trading on a cash account)….

They just pull the canceled deposit from the profits. And I found this out by doing that with AMC on the gamma squeeze. Only works for a same day deposit and day trade.

But holy fuck I am very amused. Please poke holes in this free margin thesis.

**Con:** trade goes tits up and you don’t make profit and withdrawal actually hits your bank account, need to have day trades available*

**Pros**: free temporary margin up to $1k.

^(*or be confident enough the gamma squeeze is going to push the next strike above your option contract to at least break even of what you paid…. so you end up with more money than you started)

And here’s the proof from the small tests I was running this strategy with yesterday:

Alright retards listen up this is a huge play that keeps getting auto-modded out because of market cap but it's on fire, still cheap, and institutional and HFs are buying it on value.

The ticker is Ay Dee Eee Ess.

Stock has been beaten down, with a current market cap under 200mm, despite the fact that they have 60mm in net after-tax revenues remaining for 2021. They also have a state of the art manufacturing plant built in 2010 for 400mm, which is finally operating at a profit.

And as of Q1 this year, their Cash on hand was greater than their outstanding debt. The balance sheet is shaping up beautifully. 

Retard math:

400mm plant built in 2010, say it could be liquidated for 200mm

60mm in guaranteed govt incentive a/t cash flow left in 2021

Estimated 10mm ebitda in 2022 from newly signed CABOT deal

Newly acquired water purification segment saw positive ebitda for the first time this quarter, about $2mm

$200mm + $60mm + $10mm + 2mm / 19mm shares

$14.31 in liquidation value based on immediate financials. No debt.

Why is this stock only 8 dollars?

It was picked up in VIC last week and the stock has been running ever since. Cool to see one of my ideas picked up by real time traders!

- Amazon wants to take bigger market share from Pharmacy business.
- Amazon bought PillPack and failed.
- Amazon Partnered with Bartell Drugs to ship medicines within Washington state. 
- Rite Aid removed loser Scamley.
- Rite Aid announced Telehealth partnership with Touch Health in July, 2019.
- Amazon started using Telehealth for their employees.
- Rite Aid new store models are similar to Whole Foods or Amazon Fresh. 
- Rite Aid bought Bartell Drugs, paid $1.42 million per each store. 
- Amazon announced online pharmacy in place of PillPack.
- Amazon shutdown the Haven Joint Venture plans.
- In my opinion,  Amazon will buy Rite Aid and Integrate PBM, Medicines Pick up, Amazon Package delivery/pickup, Selling Amazon products at stores, Open the new pharmacies in Whole Foods and expand it every single state.

9169,gzr7r5c,2021-05-28,t3_nmue5k,wallstreetbets,"Rite Aid current valuation would be minimum $12 - $13 billion.

ASSETS:
Retail Operations:
Rite Aid Operates 2500 stores in prime locations. Walgreens (WBA) paid 4.4B for 1900 of them and closed 600 of them. Assuming the remaining retail operations have similar value for stores, distribution centers, logistics fleet, etc. we can arrive at a $7.50 Billion valuation for retail operations. Keep in mind, management indicated that the remaining stores are more profitable operations than the ones Walgreens purchased.

HQ and Corporate:
The headquarters & the associated corporate governance systems in Camp Hill, PA are worth $2 billion. That's not a stretch by any means. They have trained employees, office buildings, IT & software infrastructure, vehicles, marketing, HR teams, internal procedures, etc. It would be difficult for anyone to put together a system to manage $24B in annual revenues, 2500 stores, and 48,000 employees, for less than $2 billion and Rite Aid already has that in place and being utilized.

Pharmacy Benefits Manager Operations:
EnvisionRx, the PBM, the growth driver of the future, is worth $4B minimum. It is growing. The population is aging. It has value. Actually, management paid more for it ($2B) in 2015 than all of the shares are currently valued and it should be valued appropriately.

ASSET VALUATION SUMMARY:
The sum of the above gives a grand total asset value of $13.5B. Long term debt, which should be easily serviceable thru continuing operations, reduces this by $3B. So we have Enterprise Value of $13.5B less $3B = $10.5Billion. There are other very valuable assets the company has including Net Operating Losses (NOL's), goodwill, recognized brand name, etc. that can easily justify a $12B valuation.",[],0

May 28, 2021 09:00 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Short Ideas  
The recent move in AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) has nothing to do with a short squeeze, Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield said Friday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""  
What Happened: 680 million shares were traded Thursday, yet AMC Entertainment only has 450 million shares outstanding, Greenfield said.  
**""If hedge funds wanted to get out of their entire position, if they were short, they could do it within minutes,""** he said, adding that the AMC Entertainment price action does not point to big institutions or hedge funds being squeezed. ",['AMC'],0

The Volatility of the underlying stock and the huge buying interest has forced the price up of the Put options on AMC.  Basically anyone who is trading options has been buying puts and the market makers have adjusted prices accordingly, supply and demand.  You never see a $500 put option on a $26 stock with a 1 week expiration.  Think of it this way, each option is worth 100 shares of the profit or loss on a stock.  A $500 option expiring in 1 week reduces your basis in the stock (if you were to get assigned) by $5 a share.  If you wanted to own the stock right now (for some reason) you should buy the ATM put option, not the stock itself.  It is the same as buying a $26 stock for $21.  Based upon the price action the CBOE Market Makers feel that there is a 100% chance the stock is going to decline by more than $5/share in less than 1 week.",['AMC'],0
