There are reasons why certain points were reached and reasons why certain patterns form. Those data points aren‚Äôt just spewed out for nothing. Not sure why people don‚Äôt see this or understand it.

I will say tho that GME has been manipulated to an unbelievable amount. Look at March 10th 348 to 172 in 20 minutes for example. I‚Äôve never seen a stock lose half its value in 20 minutes (95% of that Time was circuit breakers in place) it‚Äôs just unheard of like the flash crash of 2010. Doesn‚Äôt make sense.

I try to follow all the research I can to make my own opinion, and for that I thank you for posting this. 

What are your opinions on the cycle like nature of GME? Use reference points such as dec 20, jan 22, March 10th, feb 24-26, April 26th and so on. It‚Äôs clear there is a huge spike in volume and price on these days which I believe is from a fail to deliver cycle due to INSANE amount of puts expiring. Look at Jan 22nd 2022 GME puts. .5 strike alone has 143,000 puts, I believe 255,000 total. Also notice July 16th 2021, I believe itd 380,000 total puts for that date alone.

592,gylel21,2021-05-18,t1_gylc3be,wallstreetbets,"If I was holding 900 shares of PLUG, and I'm not, but IF I was. I would probably set up a number of rolling positions, so that I could take advantage of the slightly higher prices of the selling positions that are further out, without tying up all of my shares in one large covered call position on one specific date. Also, I don't understand fully why the dates dry up past July, so that's also a factor.  


I would take into account the current price and reassess each week and adjust my strike prices out based on how things are looking that particular week or in the near future.  


It would look something like this:  
2 x 5/28 @ Strike $x.xx  
2 x 6/4 @ Strike $x.xx  
2 x 6/11 @ Strike $x.xx  
2 x 6/18 @ Strike $x.xx  


Bear in mind, in this scenario, all your shares are potentially spoken for if the price goes nutty butters. You'll definitely want to be aware of the market in relation to the strikes you're offering.

I would also take a gander at Investopedia, which does a decent job of explaining the various scenarios related to covered calls.

I am down about 5 bucks overall on my position, but I am holding this and accumulating. The short interest is massive (top 5 in the last year), but only 1.4% of float, last I checked. Also, with high inflation and a possible incoming crash, energy stocks will outperform almost everything.  Toshiba may also be a good buy at mid $20s.

Now a bunch of amutuer retail investors are claiming every highly shorted stock is about to be short squeezed and ""go to the moon"". In reality it's just a series of pump and dumb schemes targeting people who aren't skeptical of anonymous investing tips online.",['GME'],0

Imagine I go betting and bet big, raking in huge gains and banking them. If I was a regular guy I might play more conservatively, knowing that if I get hit, I'm knocked out, bankrupt, done. Instead, I know that if I somehow I get in the hole for a million and can't pay up, there's a bailout waiting for me. Yeah, maybe I have to pay it back with interest, but that's hugely outweighed by the money I'm raking in. Regular people don't have that, so they can't bet and take the risks I do, and therefore can't make the money I do. 


That's the problem with corporate bailouts. I don't care if banks who contributed to the 2008 financial crisis got bailed out for 1 trillion and paid back 1 trillion * 1.05.

2524,gylk4i6,2021-05-18,t1_gyliym8,wallstreetbets,"I agree but it seems to be pushing it like GME. I didn't think that was going back up any time soon but many waited on a dead stock and made millions. Its seems to be the next step for AMC maybe the hype will cause a buy frenzy like GME but its a long time coming. SO I would just sit on the shares and wait with so many people wanting to get back to watching movies on the big screen last year they may actually make a great earnings this coming month or two months becasue of the summer or it could be already a  factor since some places are still doing online classes. Come summer the rest may follow. Its  a good stock for the time being but I would hold for the 20+ dollars evaluation with all the shorters getting screwed. Then I would short it. The ""puts"" are in after the price rises to a ""call"" of 24 dollars by the end of August. Losing big is that bet becasue it may not even get to that. I mean a lot of people had a lot of time on their hands who were able to ""Dimond Hands"" with all the money and time they now had to work for self. They either still doing this or they back to working for someone else as illness restrictions are laxing.","['GME', 'AMC']",0

im sure there are dozens of recent, reliable studies showing the effects of higher corporate taxation on wages, unit prices and so on available from a simple web search. this is only a topic of 'debate' among painfully uninformed people

Ever heard of Rocket home? Rocket auto? Home insurance. Auto insurance. This company has so many avenues for profit, and you want to sit here and blindly call out RKT for being subpar in comparison to UWMC, when you have absolutely no idea how their product/service lineup encapsulates the market in those areas.

4183,gyloaqf,2021-05-18,t1_gxkx120,wallstreetbets,"While TSX stocks were shaken last week, many indicators point towards a continued rally. In an era of record highs, it‚Äôs important to find the companies that will continue to provide value in the long term. So, you need to identify innovative companies with a strong leadership team that are part of a rapidly expanding market. One such stock on the TSX is WELL Health Technologies (TSX:WELL). This health-tech company has managed to crush the broader market returns ever since it went public in April 2016. However, as the first Canadian health company to offer compatibility with iPhone and recent expansion into global markets, WELL Health is just getting started. Furthermore, the stock is down over 25% since February making this a golden opportunity to buy the dip. What makes WELL Health stock a top pick? WELL Health stock is valued at a market cap of $1.32 billion. Its management team believes that the Canadian primary healthcare system is under-digitized and the lack of modernization has resulted in inefficiencies. While patients face long wait times, the physicians are overworked and burdened by operational challenges. However, the Canadian government continues to spend heavily on healthcare. For example, in 2017, the federal spending on care delivery stood at $242 billion or 11% of the country‚Äôs GDP, making the industry ripe for disruption and creating massive opportunities for WELL Health.

The company is a primary healthcare operator and a tech innovator allowing it to combine professional healthcare expertise with technology and create an improved outcome for healthcare participants.

WELL Health is an active acquirer of digital assets and primary healthcare services. These acquisitions are highly accretive and the company is now the single largest chain of primary healthcare clinics in British Columbia. Record quarterly results In the first quarter of 2021, WELL reported revenue of $25.6 million, a year-over-year increase of 150%. This growth in top-line was primarily driven by a 345% increase in Software and Services sales. WELL reported a second consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA in Q1 and this figure stood at $1.1 million. In the March quarter, WELL announced the acquisition of CRH Medical. This transaction was valued at US$372.9 million and was funded by a $302.5 million subscription receipts offering as well as a senior secured credit arrangement that was administered by JP Morgan and a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility was for an aggregate amount of US$300 million which will help WELL support the growth of its business via future acquisitions. Further, CRH is forecast to generate sales of US$150 million with an EBITDA of US$60 million and a free cash flow of US$40 million in 2021. In 2020, WELL Health‚Äôs total sales stood at $50.24 million. It means, WELL‚Äôs combined pro forma revenue is fast approaching $300 million with more than $80 million in EBITDA on a run-rate basis. What next for WELL Health stock? Bay Street analysts tracking WELL Health stock expect the company to increase sales by 367.5% year over year to $235 million in 2021 and by 40.4% to $330 million in 2022. Its bottom line will also improve from a loss per share of $0.03 in 2020 to earnings of $0.08 in 2022. As WELL Health continues to focus on acquisitions going forward, investors can expect these estimates to move higher as well. WELL Health stock is currently trading 27% below its record highs making it attractive to both growth and contrarian investors. Analysts have a 12-month average target price of $11.35 which is 67% above its current trading price. WELL Heath stock is valued at a forward price to 2022 sales multiple of less than 4x which is very reasonable given its robust forecasts and acquisition-based business model.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)",[],0

Personally I'm someone who used to always go to the movies and I just have no more taste for it, but that has more to do with holywood more than it does to do with movie theaters.  I don't live in big cities but given how much content the big companies like Disney is pushing on their online stores (Disney+ with Marvel and WB content on HBO Max) which I have been keeping up with it just seems that movie theaters as they once were would find it hard to find that market value.

I would think 15-16 sound about right with a board that has a vision for post-covid world with streaming becoming big (someone was saying instead of big theaters selling just movies doing some sort of deal with gamestop to experiences to smaller groups of people with simulated big screens of whatever kind of entertainment).

I just haven't heard what they plan to do and I don't see any movie lineup this summer that is going to pack any theaters and sell concessions like it used to.  Maybe someone can explain it to me why they think it one way or another? (I own no stock in any of the meme stocks)",['AMC'],1

5297,gylqw3p,2021-05-18,t1_gylnpoj,wallstreetbets,"So much wrong with this I don't even know where to begin.

Dark pools are not illegal, and there's not any proof that it has been illegally manipulated like the cult would have you believe.

Buying at the market price is not illegal manipulation, but it *does* have an effect on the price. Massive buy orders push the price up, even if they're below the market price, because other people trying to buy are forced to either wait until that massive buy order fills, or they have to place their buy orders at a higher price if they want it filled. But buying large amounts of stock is not illegal.

As for no short squeeze ever happening when social media was involved, what do you call what happened in January? That was a short squeeze, no? Idk how you could think social media wasn't involved, unless you think Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube don't count as social media.....

I don't see how anyone can read AMC's 10Q and like the stock. If you think there's potential for a squeeze then that's one thing, but looking at the company's fundamentals for even a brief moment shows that it's complete dogshit.

But even if you think there's a squeeze potential, it gets a LOT harder when there's massive share dilution like AMC has done. They've literally quadrupled the number of shares in the past year, they just issued 43 million more, and they still have an additional 30+ million they're authorized to issue. All of that makes it easier for shorts to cover and harder for retail to buy up the float.

there are consequences to the firm lowering wages or raising unit prices, but its not on the rate of return on capital, its on the volume of capital invested. they will maximize profits on a smaller share of invested capital

also, capital reduction doesnt just mean that an individual company moves investment overseas, though this is a common practice of course. the capital is most often simply returned to equity and debt holders, who then reinvest in other assets

if it goes overseas, then it only comes back as capital gains taxation. if it goes into national companies, then this is an economic distortion that costs productivity, growth and jobs. or perhaps it goes into speculative assets that are not considered investments in economic terms

But since I thought the stock would stay above $7.50, I \*sold\* puts, meaning the unknown buyer could/can force me to buy UWMC at $7.50. You can only do this if you have the cash or margin in your account to pay for the shares, of course. Since UWMC will (almost surely) not go below $7.50 this week, he won't exercise them (why force somebody to buy at $7.50 when you could sell at $8.something on the market!) so I will just keep the profits.

The downside, of course, is if I was wrong and UWMC went to $7 this week. Then I'd have to buy 4000 shares at $7.50, losing about $2k. (But actually, since I originally sold the puts for 69c a share, I'd still come out a little ahead. If it went lower, I would lose more. Unlike selling short, though, there is a limit. Even if UWMC went to nothing, I'd only be out $7.50 - $0.69 times the 4000 shares.",[],0

so ""government spending"" enables growth. not quite the same thing as ""government deficit spending"", which is the best economic approximation i can place for the term ""printing""

what if all that government spending was just spent or invested by taxpayers (present or future) instead?

exactly

so not only is ""government spending"" not an engine of growth, it is even less the case with ""government deficit spending"" or ""printing""

all that said, there is a place for the government provision of goods and services that are either impossible for the private sector to fill (police, courts, etc) or for which we have not yet developed an adequate private sector (infrastructure, schools, healthcare, welfare, etc). 

moreover, insofar as the government is required to spend, it should be done in a counter-cyclical fashion as best as possible help smooth the effects of the business cycle on citizens

however, the idea that we can tax and spend through government and achieve some resulting level of growth whose revenue generation justifies the initial spending is sheer fantasy

countries generally do not pay down their debt, they simply inflate it away, which is exactly what is happening right now",[],1

Someone else typically acquires the debt for cheap.  There is a current trend going on where people's mortgage lenders went out of business during the last housing market crash and they couldn't find who owned the mortgage after and so they just stopped paying.  Now they are receiving foreclosure notices.  The recommended advice in that situation is to continue making your payments into a separate account so that if someone buys the dead mortgage and tries to foreclose you can either immediately cover the arrearage, or in the best case scenario just fully pay off the mortgage because of the interest gains.

They would have a difficult case convincing a court to order you to pay back interest if they never contacted you to provide a method of payment and you have a history of payments made to an alternate holding account.  Ie, it's not your fault if the interest doesn't outpace the mortgage interest they would have received.  Depending on the cause of the bankruptcy, the new ownership will either occur right away, in which case they will notify you of the new mortgage servicing method, or if it is a market wide collapse the mortgage typically sits in a pool of other ""worthless"" assets until the market changes and they have value again and someone buys them for pennies on the dollar knowing they can foreclose on the houses.",[],0

9162,gym35sn,2021-05-18,t1_gylh3f3,wallstreetbets,"Halal is basically a Halalious joke disguised as a command from God.

Keeping Kosher/Halal (which is incomplete copy of Kosher) means one virtually have nothing else to eat except nuts, fruits, and veggies.  
Surprised? Go google for what is ""fit for consumption"" under ""Kashrut Law"" ...  
Attention Muslims: 

Here is the Holy Truth > The illiterate Muhammad pubh heard about the Jewish dietary technology from a Rabbi in Medina. Dog was added to the banned list simply becos the Allah's messenger just HATED dogs (no other rationale).  
One of the good (or bad) thing is Mohd pbuh only heard about pork ... The truth is Kosher requires total abstinence from virtually every damn food on earth eg. Red Lobster, Hairy Crabs, Juicy Clams, Caviar, Tuna (any fish with no scale is forbiddance ...about 95% of all sea organism?). Also the yummilicious Peking Duck, Dim Sum, Abalone (one of the most priced Chinese delicacies)... And the list can be stretched all the way to Mars and beyond.  
What is Kosher?  
TL:DR: Observations made by a hygiene freak Rabbi in an attempt to be more ""holy"", who eventually compiled a list of what he believes is food fit for consumption (Kosher). The list was later included in the Holy books as ""command meted out by God Almighty).  
As you may be aware, the Abraham religions are basically founded on Zombism/Slavery and similar ""tech""...  that no one is likely to question something they have been indoctrinated since birth. This is how we ended with this dietary nonsense called Kosher/Halal, and the Hindus has a similar nonsensical idea for not consuming beef and yeah, producing tons of unnecessary methane gas that probably only Donald Trump see as ""invincible gold"".  
I urge all Kosher/Halal observers to try Ketoism instead. This nonsense is bad for humanity... folks can get together for meals is one such consequences.

Another criminal truth is one is missing out the best and the most yummy mother nature has to offer... Why would God command you to refrain from consuming what is nutritious and yummy eg. bacon and sausages?
