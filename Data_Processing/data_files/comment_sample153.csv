14,gywstt0,2021-05-21,t1_gyt0icq,pennystocks,"1. ""**Also I wonder how difficult it is to prepare these drugs....""**

TK216 is administered via IV and the current recommended dosage is for a period of 14 days. This still beats the current standard of care which is chemotherapy combined with invasive surgical procedures with some patients even **having entire limbs cut off** to minimize metastasis. Again, I can't stress how pitiful current treatments are for ES and TK216 beats them both in terms of efficacy, safety, and dosage form.

1. ""**The TK drug wasn't doing well in the data until cohort 9....""**

There were 9 escalation cohorts from 18-288 mg/m2/day.  Dosages used in the other cohorts were exploratory in nature and it was only the 9th and expansion cohort that used the current recommended phase 2 dose of 200mg/m2/day. 

1. **""I've seen drugs like Lartruvo get fast tracked...then fail in the macro data....""**

Fair point but the same can be said about every single clinical trial in existence, so it's not an argument unique to ONCT per se. This risk is the name of the game in the biotech/pharma industry. I still find it very promising that there are 2 sustained complete responses, one for over 2 years and the other for over a year. No ES intervention that I know of has reported this kind of data. 

1. **""ROR sounds like a good new target to try, but I've seen other targets like hedgehog fail when you use more patients.""**

Agreed! ROR1 is a great target due to its specificity and safety profile. Can't say much about using more patients since that will just come later but cirmtuzumab beats hedge inhibitors when it comes to safety. There are 3 approved hedgehog inhibitors: ATO, Vismodegib, and Sonidegib. A quick glance at each of its safety profile will show that cirmtuzumab (as of now) offers a promising combination of efficacy and safety. Then again, we're talking about 2 entirely different set of drugs for 2 entirely different set of indications so this really is comparing apples to oranges at this point.",[],0

This capital would definitely be enough to cover any short term debt obligations. Also it should be mentioned that the stockholder equity was last reported to be around 200 million which is basically double what the current market cap is, kind of signals that even on paper the stock is undervalued. After a good amount of this debt clears up it will also lessen the very high interest expenses they’ve been paying which has been the main cause of them losing profits since their income from operations has been at a respectable level.

Interesting thing on their video was it looked like the device was designed to be expired from the mouth and redirected to the nasal cavity.  That is odd to say the least.  

More info. is needed to get a better understanding of WHAT the drug is in the first place.  My opinion, it is likely just a normal corticosteroid (like methylprednisone) which was modified, to make it proprietary, and being given intranasal for faster absorption to the brain.  We use high dose steroid for acute spinal cord injury so that is where they probably get the idea.  I can see it being helpful, but question if they prove it why anyone would not just use intranasal steroids (IF I am reading their approach correct) and not pay extra.  My assumption is that is why they are coming up with some cool sounding delivery system to market in the drug WITH its delivery system in one package as being more convenient.  Just a guess though.

https://www.worldoil.com/news/2019/11/13/iea-predicts-global-oil-demand-will-level-off-around-2030

There are more optimistic studies but those have been funded by big oil companies.

If you think about it, the whole carbon free topic is pushed by USA and Europe and its not that much of a topic in emerging countries.

USA and Europe only represent about 1/8 of the world population. Even though the oil consumption is enormously higher then in the rest of the world its still less then half of the oil demand.

Many studies expect a fast increasing demand for oil in emerging countries as these countries grow their economy. I think thats plausible.

So in my mind oil is still around until 2050 at least, even if the media claims otherwise.

Btw anyone can download the presentation from the company website and use it for their DD posts.

Also as I posted on a different thread about the app. 

If you wish to buy property for short term abnb rental you must have cash or get a loan on your primary residence and use the funds for that.  Banks and traditional lenders will not give you mortgage on a short term rental.  If it is investment property the generally want it in a business and it now becomes a business loan.  This is when it gets tricky.  Most banks want the property at least 50% owner occupied and the rest they are looking for ideally two years leases.  So without the long term Tennant you are not getting financing.  
How do I know this because I have been managing national banks for over 20 years and everyone's policy are pretty much the same.  
This app will link up the individual or institutional investor with the prospective property purchaser/owner to allow them to get financing. 

As far is a can tell on the crypto part it seems that is for the 10 properties they already own. If you invest in it they give you a crypto in return. However I may be wrong on that.  

Now I am a banker not a financial advisor so serious look this crap up yourself it is all there.  Secondly I am banker and not an English major so ignore typos misspelling and punctuation. Finally if you don't like it don't buy it if you do buy and hold this should have some good short term gains with long term growth.",[],0

""Gurl"" below just commented multiple times on what you should do as if she knows what she's talking about enough to give advice but if you look further down you'll see she just posted a comment stating she just made her ""first big purchase"" of $90....I have over $50K invested.

In my OPINION, you should always diversify in almost any type of investing you do. I personally have 17 different OTC stocks at the moment. MOST OTC stocks will end up at $0.00 in the long term (and by most I mean 19/20) so unless you are extremely well versed in financial sheet analysis (I already know you aren't just by the question you asked) trying to pick out the perfect ones isn't doable for most people.

12 of the 17 stocks I own are more than 25% losses at the moment. 3 are profitable in the 10-20%ish return on investment range, and TWO I have made well over 1000% on each.

In the land of penny stocks it's about picking a couple that will have massive returns and knowing that most will leave you with a hole in your pocket if you hold them for too long.

Study a dozen stocks for about a month and then jump into the ones you deem to have potential after they have a big sell off. DON'T buy into hype or try to chase a rising share price",[],1

Your right I know more technical analysis but, that goes out the window with penny stocks. I only know to buy a penny stock if current liabilities are less than current asset and the same for total assets and liabilities. I look for triple digit percent revenues in the PRs.

As the owner of an electric car, who also pays attention, charging stations are going to become travel stops only, like ""onroute"" or other highway centres with bathrooms and food for longer distance travellers. Charging stations will never replace gas stations, because Evs will almost exclusively recharge at the owners home, at night.

With a gas vehicle, I'm forced every 400-500km to visit a gas station to refuel, no matter what. With my EV, I only need a charging station if my trip (or cumulative trip over a short period) is over the capacity of my car. Otherwise I plug in every couple days at my house, it's one of the best parts of my EV. 

With an early generation kia Soul EV that goes 150km, the only time I need to use a charging station is when I go to my parents house, 150km away (and sometimes I can make in it a single charge). The current generation of the same car has another 100 or so Km in the bank, so everyone who bought 2 years after me, who lives like me, will almost NEVER need to visit a charging station. Ever.

Not stock advice, just an observation. As someone sitting at a charging station in the past wishing for more charging stations, I came to realize that once EVs get to a certain battery capacity (like many are now, in the 300-400km range) you won't need these stops, unless you are on a 4+ hour trip, and people will actively avoid them because they take time (20minutes or more) and cost money.

1) There has been a large INCREASE in diversity and inclusion issues covered by the media since June of 2020.
2) There was a TREMENDOUS amount of Twitter coverage and encouragement of people buying shares in minority owned/run businesses last year.
3) The Wall Street Journal published at least 2 stories in June of last year talking about people buying minority business shares in June 2020.
4) Twitter mentions of these 5 stocks have already started in 2021 several months ago.
5) The current US administration will most likely talk up the Juneteenth holiday MUCH more than the previous administration.
6) Major corporations (McDonalds, Walmart, JP Morgan, etc.) have announced strong support of these companies.  Corporate pressure on this topic is HIGH!
7) The increase of Robinhood users and communication forums like this one on Reddit have made MANY more people aware of opportunities such as this.

Here are the downside risks:

1.  They don't find commercial extractable oil.  They have already found oil so that is not an issue.  The already released it as a active petroleum system which is a VERY specific term in the O/G industry.  They can't say that as that unless it is true otherwise it is illegal.  If they weren't sure and were just trying to pump up the price they would have just been more vague to protect themselves from legal liability.  They are not stupid even if they were/ are crooks.
2. If they do find commercial extractable oil Namibia renegs and boots them out of the play to keep it all for themselves.  

The above are real concerns.  ALL the stuff in the NG article don't matter for the investor.  For example, lets say they are ALL true and recon still finds commercial oil, what happens?  The guilty go to jail and the shareholder STILL makes A TON of money as that doesn't affect their shares.  It isn't like the SEC is going to take the shares away from the investor.  So, for me at least, I don't see any of those accusations, even if ALL true, as any negative.  This ALL comes down to... can they find oil they can dig up in a CONVENTIONAL manner or not.  If the do we make money and if they don't we lose money.  It really is that simple. 

I absolutely do think Steinke played a pretty slick move in getting money by how he moved the rights to the play around, but keep in mind ALL of these transactions were passed through the regulators at the time with no issues so it isn't like they are going to have an issue with them now when they knew about them then when they allowed it.

I do agree folks should be aware of the downside risk of the play, but the NG has not bearing on the downside risk TO THE INVESTOR.  If true those guys will go to jail.  That outcome doesn't bother me as it doesn't affect me making money on the play (which is ALL related to pulling oil out of the ground).",[],0
