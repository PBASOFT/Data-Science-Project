Futures are a bit higher this morning: Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq all up about 0.3% as of 0620. Yesterday things were flat after a rally earlier in the day stalled.

Bond yields are ticking a bit lower. 10-year down to 1.569, perhaps an indication that investors are less worried about inflation. Disappointing new home sales yesterday likely contributed to that. The VIX is down to about 20, but not sure if that really means anything anymore.

There just isn’t that much to move markets today. Couple Fed speeches. Bank CEOs will testify before a joint session of Congress. Some earnings, but mostly not until after the close: Dick’s Sporting Goods, Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters, NVIDIA, Snowflake.

He's got too many responsibilities to go hiking for a month.  When the kid is grown and moved out,  he's not going to be in shape for that kind of hike.   Reality sucks too.

34,gzi0oj6,2021-05-26,t1_gzhldel,investing,"> Yeah but those fairly routine pensions were not sustainable.

I have to disagree.  They are working fine in many other western countries where the actuaries are allowed to do their jobs and the CFOs can not mess with them.

Life expectancy has increased a great deal, but most of that is due to reduced infant mortality, vaccines for childhood disease and not getting killed as often on the job.  But what matters in this discussion of pensions is life expectancy at retirement age.

In 1940 a 65 year old American could expect to live another 12.7 years [source](https://www.ssa.gov/history/lifeexpect.html)

In 2018 a 65 year old American could expect to live another 18.1 years [source](https://www.ssa.gov/history/lifeexpect.html)

So an improvement of 5.4 years, however in the meantime the full retirement age has been bumped to 67 so the net increase in retirement years is only 3.4.  

Pensions provide effective means to mitigate longevity risk (by pooling longevity over a large group of people of the same retirement age) and sequence of returns risk (by pooling that risk over large groups of different retirement ages).  What they do not do is let financial service companies bleed retail investors for fees.

The pension system is broken in the United States, but it does not need to be so.  However a lot of people stand to make a lot of money out of this mess, and they have a loud voice in the financial press.

Finally, if a professionally run pension system can not provide for retirement income then what chance does an individual have with a 401k/IRA?",[],0
35,gzi0r0s,2021-05-26,t3_njy53z,investing,"Kind of weird reading some of the responses here with regards to Kraken.  Coinbase Pro has a better fee structure than Kraken and significantly more liquidity, meaning less slippage. If you're actively trading, you should use Pro.  I strongly disagree that Kraken is in any way easier to use, but I'll leave that as a matter of taste. 

Analysts expect revenue to decline > 30% in Q2. Publicly available data suggests that Coinbase has already matched Q1 revenue with 5 weeks to go in the quarter. They are on pace to beat full-year estimates by \~50%. Their custody and prime brokerage businesses are going to be big revenue drivers and have excellent defensibility. 

Below is my thread on Coinbase's future prospects which touches on some of their opportunities and why ""crypto winter"" isn't going to be as bad as people think. If people want to throw a company trading at a 11 forward multiple under the bus, that's their prerogative. But you are ignoring that this is the most profitable tech company IPO ever and they are positioned to be the Google of their industry. Keep an open mind and you may like what you see.

Pension funds can also bleed investors of their money, depending on their fee structures. Oftentimes that function is outsourced and it’s not like some company is doing it for free out of the kindness of their hearts.

Furthermore, pension funds have to take meaningfully less risk (which translates to lower returns) than do individual investors over the course of their lives as the money is pooled both to provide for current retirees as well as future ones. The most common private pension scheme in Germany has a guaranteed rate of return of 0.9%. Nominal. You pay 4% up front to the scheme on contributions. 2.5% yearly admin fee. Net of fees, your promised real returns are negative. Not to mention that 20% of German pension funds are at risk of insolvency and many more will be at risk if low interest rates persist.

If you go to /r/eupersonalfinance you will very quickly find out that the pension system in Europe is much more fragile than you’re making it out to be. They have to invest in stocks just like we do.

Why are car P/E ratios generally under 10? For something that (apart from some short term sales) should always be needed, it seems like a bargain. 

Could it be that Tesla expectations of dominance are subtracting from the expected returns of these car companies? I am looking at Toyota for example, who were the early leaders in electric tech and are now focusing on a large new range of ev’s. Could TM be a great buy if I think they will catch up on the ev tech?

Lastly, with the expected switch to greener tech, any thoughts on silver? I visit r/wallstreetsilver a lot and they have me convinced that the price will explode, but I would love other investors opinions. Reasons for silver: 
Decreased supply: mined silver per year has been decreasing and it is very difficult to find silver mines (most silver is a by product from other mines). 
Increased demand: Green tech (eg solar panels and electric cars). Also increased investor focus (silver squeeze movement plus it is a traditional inflation hedge)

You have to be going nearly orbital speed for point to point travel over any appreciable distance - which requires full re-entry heat shields and hypersonic aircraft design.

The reason for this is that the Earth is a very big sphere with a radius of 6400km. In order to fly from one point to another ballistically, your flight path has to have enough of this 6400km circle such that you intersect the atmosphere at your destination. Given the difference between orbit at 150km and the ground at 0km is just 2% the radius of this circle, you need to be doing almost orbital speed to go from New York to Sydney.

They've been that way for a while now. Automobile manufacturing is a costly, difficult business - there's a massive list of carmakers in the US that have gone bankrupt over the years - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_automobile_manufacturers_of_the_United_States. Aston Martin has gone bankrupt 7 times and almost was #8 last year.

Could there be some degree of multiple expansion if legacy companies succeed in EV? Possibly, but EVs don't make a difficult business any easier. How many times has Tesla talked about being in distress along the way? This is an industry where few succeed, but in the last year the way that people were buying anything EV-related would suggest people thought all of these names were going to succeed.

People hyped up EVs to the point of a massive bubble in things like WKHS last year, which only delivered 6 trucks last quarter. A lot of the weaker/weakest EV plays have now lost well over half their value. Rob Arnott called the rise in EV stocks a ""big market delusion"": 

""A “big market delusion,” according to the paper, occurs when all the firms in an evolving industry rise together, despite that fact that they are competing against each other and only some can ultimately succeed. The trio cited airlines as a past example of an industry built around emerging technology, where “virtually every company in the business either failed or merged into a larger airline, most of which also collapsed.” (https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qx4f8709q5nf/Big-Market-Delusion-Rob-Arnott-Attacks-Tesla-Electric-Vehicle-Industry)

Amusingly, Ark seems to now be inching towards Volkswagen the other day after acting like anything that wasn't named Tesla was a dinosaur.

Of course they do. Weedstocks thinks weed stocks are going to the moon. So much of the silver stuff that I've seen resembles variations on precious metal bug blogs a decade ago.

They're not all that different. People in this very thread are saying hypersonic point to point travel may be VG's bread and butter once they figure out space tourism. But SpaceX has said they are looking to fo the same thing. Now let's see which is a better business model: even if VG could bring costs down substantially,  an intercontinental trip would cost around $100k to carry 6 people. SpaceX would be able to carry 100+ passengers on the same flight for less than $10k. So where exactly does VG have room for their niche,  let alone room for profitability?",['SPCE'],0

I’m 23 years old, CPA, currently investing about $2,000 per month into individual stocks. Total portfolio is about $40k, made up of 28 stocks. Mostly high multiple tech (ARK stocks), but also some healthcare, big tech, and REITs for the yield. I also have a Roth that I contribute $500 per month.

I won’t need the money for 20-30+ years, and I’m comfortable holding through volatility. My focus is really just finding quality companies that will be long-term winners. My question is:

1. How many stocks is enough to be adequately diversified as the portfolio grows? I feel i could cut down to under 20 stocks and concentrate in my top holdings. 

2. I’ve been aggressively buying stocks on the way down and trimming positions on the way up. How often should I be taking profit? Does this strategy make sense long-term?

Short term (i think/hope) they will have a blow out quarter,  they are such a well run company that they said they don't expect any problems with chip shortages that are shutting down the other car manufacturers. Morningstar has them rated as a three,  but said they will reevaluate after the June numbers come out and I expect those will be good. 

Medium term,  I really don't think the infrastructure for mass adoption of pure Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) will be in place for a lot longer than people anticipate, for example,  large number of chargers in apartment building or hotel parking lots.   Toyota has the Plug in Hybrid (PHEV) that is the perfect balance right now of a 60%-80% EV, but can go anywhere without range anxiety.   They have two models right now and more coming next year (I think).  They currently have eight regular hybrid models (all the minivans are hybrid) that look really good.   This should improve the financials even more since it's less CAFE credits to purchase making the other companies Pure BEV need to actually be profitable instead of supplemented by selling CAFE credits.  

Long term they have the scale and are working on both advanced batteries and Hydrogen and will be ready whichever becomes adopted.   They do have a pure BEV for next year,  and expect eight models by 2025 which i think is still plenty early even with optimistic assumptions about infrastructure.

Examples; 

* The only thing they are / aim to be dependent on for true, force majeure delays is raw materials (think, the aluminum and steel for components).
* A communications satellite antenna part costs $100K? No, it doesn’t. Find a way to make it yourself, I mean, it’s just soldered circuits in a titanium box, right? You can do it in house for $4K? Great.
* Supplier gives an 8 month lead time for a rocket fairing? Well, how much of that is straight manufacturing vs. waiting on sub-contracted sub-components? Let’s just repurpose 2000 sqft of the main factory floor and build our own fairings in 2 weeks.
* Anything that they have the manufacturing ability to make themselves, short of nuts and bolts probably, they will attempt to make themselves. That way they aren’t depending on lead and shipping time and supplier shortages.
* Analysis is in-house. Rocket blew up? Wait, your external engineering consulting firm is asking for $500K and 4 months to run FEA failure simulations on it? No. Re-purpose 4 engineers in my team who specialize in it, and get me an answer by end of the day. It doesn’t even have to be right, but we’ll have a plan for tomorrow.

Low volume overall is a factor, but that alone doesn’t concern me too much. If low liquidity combines with other factors… that’s when trouble can brew. 

Keep an eye on the dollar, bonds, and high yield debt for clues to when something may go wrong. All looks well at the moment, but don’t lose sight of them.

EUR/USD 

This is approaching its January high. I don’t think it will be a double top. The fed wants a weaker dollar and I think they will make it happen. It just takes longer than traders are willing to accept. I expect resistance as it reaches the January high which could then cause some turbulence in everything, but I still expect it to push higher this summer.

10 Year Bond 

This been in a range of 1.5-1.7 at it’s pre-pandemic levels. It’s approaching the lower end of the range and looks like it could have the setup to drop lower but another reversal higher along with a dollar in correction would give me caution in stocks.

High yield debt

Want the best indicator to market risk? Look no further than high yield debt. Simply put, if this is correcting I make myself have the patience to wait for it to calm down before buying any stocks. 

Right now high yield debt looks good, but the weakening trend since the start of the year is concerning.

This is fundamentally because people push back their normal upgrade cycle to wait for the new technology to meet their expectations.  When this pinch point is reached, all the big auto company’s current P/E ratios are garbage in determining future profitability because those products will quickly reach zero demand.

So buying a legacy automaker is highly speculative because we don’t know who will emerge from the other side of this ICE demand collapse.  Tesla is more highly valued because it is a safer bet that it will be around in 5-10 years - though it is challenging to forecast how much they’ll sell.",['TSLA'],1

I wanted to mainly comment on the article though, I just didn’t wanted to start shiting on it without valid opinion. Over my now longer life I’ve noticed a trend. There these very strongly written articles and doomsday preaching documentaries that follow the same template. They only change the topic through the years. When I was very young I read and watched a number of things about the deforestation of the rain forest and the huge hole in ozone layer. I was young so I took that to heart. I also remember the solution captain Planet offered(eco friendly cartoon superhero). He suggested we stop using paper bags in the grocery store and start using plastic bags. Keep in mind I was in Eastern Europe where there were no bags available in the store, you always bring your own. Now many years later the ozone layer has healed and it turned out corporation are cutting down the rainforest to open land for animal raising and it’s not for paper. Now we are watching documentaries showing a huge pile of plastic bags floating in the ocean and the climate change caused by the cars and not the ships they say. If you’re following along you will know why the article is so strongly worded. The more extreme the language and data the more likely it will get the attention of more people. It got your attention so you’re sharing it too. I understand the climate is getting warmer and weather gets more extreme as consequence. However, at this moment billions are invested in developing Florida’s beach front properties. Some of them are not even diversifying lol.

SEC explanation -> ""**A SPAC may identify in its IPO prospectus a specific industry or business that it will target** as it seeks to combine with an operating company, but it is not obligated to pursue a target in the identified industry."" 

So most of the SPACs don't list the target's name for the reasons listed in the comments below:

1) They don't want competition for the same target from other SPACs.

2) If an announcement is made too prematurely, the target company will have an advantage in the negotiations. 

3) If the deal doesn’t go through, SPACs credibility takes a big hit resulting in investor pull out. By keeping the names a secret, in the event of a deal falling apart, they can quietly move on to the next target without public embarrassment.

4) Often they don't know yet who they will buy. When a SPAC is formed, they start looking for companies.",[],0

It's not really a crisis either or unexpected.  When the SLR exemptions were removed earlier this year, one of the potential issues people were concerned with was excess deposit money flooding into money market funds and pushing t-bill rates to zero or negative which is exactly what has happened.

There's a bunch of excess cash sitting around as deposits currently and not enough short term debt or overnight borrowing to put it into for money market funds and banks.  That's pushed all these rates towards zero or in some cases below.  That matters to the Fed because it impacts their target rate and  they enforce that rate through OMO, repo and reverse repo operations like this.  It should also be transitory as it's largely caused by the US treasury drawing down the TGA for the most recent round of stimulus and maybe tax refunds going out as well.

In short, I do.  Now, do you remember what they used to say about IBM in the 1950s-1960s and their stupid computers.  IBM, MSFT, AAPL, DELL, HPQ, all of them had a huge run from the 1960s-2010s.  With that said.  SPCE, if it works will have a similar run, you are getting in on the ground level.  Need I mention TSLA 10 years ago that you would have bought at $25.   Most serious investors, unless they are in already, will not join you until later stages.  When they join, the stock will get so expensive you will pass it by and miss it. 

They have a different approach from Space X and others.  They have a plane that launches another small plane into space.  It is re-usable and can carry people to the edge of space.  They will be the low cost travel to low altitude space.  No other company that I know is currently doing that.  They already have a their own Space Port and have successfully launch people to lower orbit.  They do not have rockets, their business is to take people to lower level orbit for a short time and give everyone a taste of what it means to go to space.

This stock is not one that you will see with any amount of real revenue soon, but they have a plan and it is new and with the backing they have (Virgin Companies), they will likely be successful.  Get some money there and let it be.  Never invest what you are not willing to lose and things will look clearer.

357,gziqzs0,2021-05-26,t3_nl3ne2,investing,"I've done a lot of research into the commercial space sector. I'm going to lay it too you straight: Virgin Galactic is a BS company with no real future, which is seeing stock bumps based on mostly meaningless accomplishments and (more important) the fact that people want to desperately invest in SpaceX, but can't. Virgin Galactic is the girlfriend you get when the one of your dreams isn't remotely interested in you.

First, let's talk about business model. Its suborbital fights.To date it's sold about about 600 tickets for $250,000 for what amounts to a joy ride where you experience a few minutes of weightlessness and see the curvature of the earth in a vehicle, that despite extensive testing, is far less safe than a jetliner (obviously). 

Wealthy adventure seekers and influencers with deep enough pockets and tolerance of risk will go for it. How big is that market really? For comparison climbing Mount Everest, a modestly comparable ""once in a lifetime adventure"" costs about $50,000 on average. The very upper end of an Everest adventure is $150,000. An expedition also takes about two months, after months of preparation. So adventurers are getting a substantial return on their $50,000 - $150,000.

&#x200B;

By contrast, a Virgin Galactic flight amounts to an afternoon trip. About 3 hours, and 5 minutes of weightlessness for $250,000. Word will get out on that among those who could afford that real fast: it's a dangerous rip off, and you're better off waiting for a the real thing.

Well a Blue Origin New Shepard Flight will be significantly more substantial a suborbital experience for a (reportedly) comparable price. Furthermore in terms of ""experience factor"" (which is ultimately, what you're paying for), you experience blasting off on a rocket and landing in a capsule... way more ""adventure-y"" than taking off and landing like an airplane. I know that sounds ridiculous on its face, but folks are only buying experience, and nothing else. And the more authentic space experience? The one that blasts off like a rocket and lands like Apollo 11, or the one that is closer to a business jet?

&#x200B;

But even New Shepard is pretty B.S. too because its experience will be both costly and short. The ROI, compared to an Everest Expedition, is still ridiculous.

Really, what people would be looking for is a two week trip to space on a Crew Dragon or Starship, the former of which are in an entirely other price bracket (for now) and the latter is years away. That, with a couple of weeks of space-training (or however long they do it for a fully private trip like that down the road), would be much more in line with the Everest model of a high-price adventure with a substantial ROI. 

&#x200B;

Virgin Galactic said that they expect $1 billion in revenue annually at their spacepot. That's a complete joke. They would have to sell 4000 tickets a year, and fly three times a day. They will not sell 4000 tickets a year. They will not fly three times a day including weekends and holidays. They have one vehicle that can fly.  Even with two more, they won't turn them around in less than 24 hours. And they won't be durable enough to fly without prolonged maintenance at that rate. That's better than even a Boeing jet.

It's a trap. It's a huge trap. I've been saying it's a trap well before meme stocks and SpaceX being substantial. It's been Richard Branson's flight of fancy for nearly 20 years because unlike Elon Musk, he did not have the ambition or vision to develop actual orbital spaceflight from the ground. And that's not typical Elon bootlicking. The fact is, for folks who weren't old enough to remember, in the Early 2000s, in the wake of Columbia, a lot of private space companies started. A bunch of them tried to buy surplus government hardware. A number of them also tried to do suborbital because it was supposed to be cheaper, faster and easier. That is where Virgin Galactic fell. But tell me if you've heard some of these names: Rocketplane Kistler, Excalibur Almaz, Space Transport Corporation, Mir Corp, Armadillo Aerospace,  XCOR Aerospace. Many more mostly paper companies.

&#x200B;

Who made it from that era?

SpaceX, Orbital, SNC, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic. And of that list, Orbital and SNC's overall business long predate the commercial space era, Blue Origin has Bezos billions and SpaceX is the only one to truly start from scratch and launch things into space. Even Orbital spent years largely relying on old Russian engines and retired US ICBMs - as I said, the original private space model of using surplus government equipment to skip developing technology from scratch. Only SpaceX and Virgin Galactic did it. Difference being, SpaceX aimed higher, while Virgin Galactic built shoddy vehicles, on bad times, and got people killed in the process.

Can you make money in the short term on Virgin Galactic? Probably. There just isn't a lot of options for people who want to invest in the commercial space industry, and our darling SpaceX just isn't interested in going public. 

But in the long term? 

\- It's business forecast make no sense and presumes a flight rate it'll never meet.

\- It's nearest competitor, Blue Origin, will offer a better experience and compete for the same customers and nearly the same price target.

\- Given its rate of technical development, it'll be 15 years minimum before it puts a person into space, and by then, ""Block II"" Starships with huge passenger loads will (potentially) be flying into orbit. 

Does this sound like a serious space company? Does this sound like a business worth investing in? Getting SPCE as its symbol just underscores the lack of seriousness of it as a business. Yeah guys... totally SpaceX, right? Totally about space travel, right? Ridiculous.  It's a suborbital stunt flight vehicle with no future and a business that's been built on bad tech and bad promises since four years before the Falcon 1 flew the first time.

Avoid it if going long. Short, better people can give you advice for that. But long... no shot. It's bullshit.",['SPCE'],0

Depending where you are at in life, there is a decent chance that you'll have money in the market during a crash. Law of large numbers and all that. (Or even multiple if you are young!) But, we have no idea when that's going to be. Could crash next week. Could crash in 8 years. If you hold your money back and it turns out the 8 year scenario is more accurate though, then there's every possibility that the crash won't even extend down to the current price point. Meaning now was really the last time to get in at these prices. And if it turns out to be next week, well, yeah, that does suck. However, if your holding for decades it's fairly irrelevant actually. 

Then there's also the possibility that you fuck up trying to buy the crash. Lots of people missed the bottom of the covid crash thinking that the market still had a much larger fall coming. Turns out it didn't, and they lost a lot of money trying to time the crash. 

Try not to let the fact that the market grew scare you. The only time that scares me is when I'm making individual stock plays. Cause unlike the broad market, there's a high risk that an individual company is caught up in a fomo bubble and just never reaches those prices again. But that's not true for broad market funds.

That's why business buyouts are so popular. And why they are so terrible.

Let someone else do the leg work to build a company, but only give the founders/investors cash handouts. The people who did the actual leg work are stuck with a shitty salary. 

The new company comes in and changes the org structure to squeeze the dollars out of the factory in the name of ""efficiency."" But a lot of these shit-for-brains executives can't tell the difference between fucking over workers (making them work harder for the same dollar) and actual efficiency improvements (process improvements to save time). So they end up pushing their workers harder and the quality of the product goes down.

I’ve studied a lot of history and the only system I’ve seen that didn’t have systemic exploitation of workers was hunter gathers during the Paleolithic era. The second we decided to live off agriculture it immediately lead to the formation of kingdoms in which “nobility” oversees the “peasants”.

546,gzjwr9i,2021-05-26,t1_gzjv90w,investing,"In the case of Walmart, they could absolutely reduce product costs immediately.  Walmart buys and sells all of the same products today.  So their spend would go higher yield lower purchase price points for WMT.  Immediate synergies.  Also, no cannibalization of existing sales.  Walmart and Rite Aid already co-exist.  The spend that is done at Walmart at its large department stores is separate from the ""convenience"" spend that is done at local, nearby retail pharmacies.  Another synergy is that the larger spend with product vendors and prescription providers will also yield a reduced cost on Walmart's existing business base.  So the result is a big net incremental gain for WMT of $24 billion in sales and $3 - $5 billion in profit. 

For Amazon, perhaps the same synergies are not in place.  However, if Amazon allows Walmart to snap up RAD, the AMZN should just get out of the pharmacy space.  The business will never scale up to warrant the focus.  

Amazon knows they can't run a pharmacy business without a physical retail chain.  That is why they are now investigating this option.  The idea that they will put pharmacies in Whole Foods is ludicrous.  You don't create a space for sick people to come to get their medicines when you are trying to promote fresh, healthly, organic food options.  Whole Foods is a no-go.  As for starting to build your own chain of brick and mortar retail locations --- forget it.  Walmart buys RAD and leaves AMZN in the dust.

I’m no expert, but here is some food for thought based on my learning in stocks...

1) You need a well-defined system in order to be profitable.  Your trade idea is to buy large cap stocks after they post small gains and ride the momentum until they stop moving up.  Are you talking about gains between market open and close, or do intraday gains count?  How much of a loss will you accept before cutting a bad trade?  Does there need to be a catalyst gain, or or do any old gains count.  That’s just the tip of the iceberg of what swing traders typically consider.

2) A typical trading system goes through these steps:  study, back test, trade in a simulated account, trade with very small amounts, trade full size. Beginners tend to be impatient, so they skip the prep steps and then lose their money.

3) Typical swing trading systems break the total bankroll into 10 parts (that would make your trade size $1,000 each)

4) There is a popular swing trading system called CANSLIM that I suggest you read about.  It has fairly simple rules and is popular among less experienced traders.  investors business daily has a subscription service where they give you tons of good stocks to consider with notes about how they stack up in the CANSLIM system.  It costs about $40 per month and gives you stocks to consider while teaching you the context of why they are good for swing trading.

5) you need a trading platform that can support this type of trading.  I suggest thinkorswim through TD Ameritrade

Hope this helps!

Gotta love the hot takes from redditors who think they know more about the streaming business (or any business really) than the executives who specialize in that business.

Piracy is not as much of a threat to the majority of these players anymore.  The subscription costs don't just buy you access to their content, it buys you convenience.  The convenience of having that content on any device, anytime, anywhere.  I'm sure someone will brag about how their sick plex server or whatever bullshit, but your average consumer doesn't want to deal with that nonsense.  The majority just wants to hit a button on their phone or TV remote and see the content as soon as it's available

I just recognized that I didn't have a consumer cyclical company,  starting looking and I thought,  yep auto makers are cheap,  I think Toyota has a company culture that really is top notch,  everyone studies the way they do things,  so I bought a  little.  Just 18 shares,  I read some more and I really think the rest of the industry is pushing Battery EVs too soon,  and Toyota has really good hybrids which can appeal to more people.   Then I read the earnings call and bought another ten.  Sold a stock i didn't have a large position in that disappointed me, and some dividends,  and my paycheck contribution and bought another 16 shares. 

Maybe I'm foolish for not looking harder at different cyclical stocks,  but when they said they were prepared and didn't have serious chip troubles i was sold.  My theory is that right now it's a great time to sell cars.   Everyone is talking about inflation and possibly rising interest rates so if you are going to make a large purchase that you finance (like a car), sooner is better than later.   My biggest risk/fear is that they don't have a chip problem,  but maybe there is a hidden shipping problem (plenty of cars but the ports are backlogged type thing.

We also find that common ownership by the “Big Three” (BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street) is associated with lower airline prices, while common ownership by shareholders other than the Big Three is associated with higher prices.

I would add on to what the others are saying, have the majority of your holdings and things that will guarantee a steady return over the next 30 years like the total US market, QQQ, small cap value, but you can do ""satellite investing"" with a much smaller allocation (less than 20%) in single stocks and other riskier things.  Make sure you determine how long your holding is.  Timing the market is very difficult, but if you see a stock with a good P/E ratio that is miles below all time high, that might be a good stock to invest in.

To your point about Toyota and inventory: I drove by the Toyota dealership and it seemed like they had no inventory to speak of. So they could have shipment issues or are just taking advantage of the shortage of cars and are going to have a blow out quarter. 

The reason I bought STLA was: I started looking for a vehicle and wanted a plug-in hybrid SUV. There aren’t many options, mainly German. Then the Jeep Wrangler came out with a plug in hybrid and I test drove it. Was really impressed overall and ended up buying one. Then we visited a large auto show and the marketing of Stellantis really impressed. Jeep/Ram are going after some key products of Ford/GM.

So I agree with your point.

I think realistically the best way to transition a company like Exxon Mobil to clean energy would be for the government to give them some kind of financial incentive to sell off their refineries and other assets that would be obsolete in exchange for 100% transition to clean energy.

I'm sure people who have a background in this type of research can make a reasonably accurate estimate if anyone had serious doubts about their claims. Nobody seems outraged or surprised by their claims though, so I dont see why I should be.  


>The exact admixture of ingredients?

Sure, why not? Its not like Virgin invented some new type of fuel. They use a mixture of nitrous oxide and HTPB, like several other companies and countries that build and launch rockets.

Generally to enforce the “public good” necessarily requires a concentration of power because it’s impossible for everyone to agree on what is “good for the public”. Enforcement of the public good has been a huge sticking point of collectivist philosophies throughout history and that is not unique to Marxism (i.e. French Revolution). But democratic socialism has so many flavors I would need to know which philosophical strain strain we’re talking about.

>	Everything else you described has nothing to do with farming and everything to do with private ownership of land. 

I know farming as root cause of class struggle isn’t a mainstream argument but I literally have not found one agricultural based society throughout history that has mitigated the exploitation of people. I ask because I’m looking to poke a hole in my argument. 

>	What if there never were any kings (people that own all the land)?

This was how we lived for a couple hundred thousand years, and humans did not live in peace with one another. We banded into tribes and there was a constant struggle for resources, not a sharing of resources (the tribal struggle?). If you think about it on a biological level humans compete for 100% of the same resources as other humans. Why should I let you have access to the best land with the most food and the hottest chicks if I am as entitled to it as you are? The tribal societies were pretty much all conquered by agricultural societies. 

>	Privatisation is what leads to class struggle. Nothing else

A problem with disbanding our kingdom and giving everything back to the people is then who will stop the kingdom next door from taking over our land? This is the impossible dilemma of democratic socialism - I’ll give you the land back AND protect you from your neighbors AND do it equally There is an inherent instability in this equation that will necessarily lead to a concentration of power. A stable system needs checks and balances to power.

It would appear as though I was partially mistaken. I will likely update my strategy because of this. What actually occurs to any security in S&P 500, Russel 1000, or QQQ is any price movement of greater than 10% of the last day’s close results in a 15-minute halt. So the actual advice should be as follows:

In the occurrence of a black swan event, QQQ can only drop by, at most 10% every 15 minutes. A drop of 10% is highly likely, but not guaranteed, to correspond to a drop of at least 7% on S&P, triggering a market-wide halt. If not, the halt of all QQQ-listed securities (for 15 minutes) will likely result in the bid-ask of QQQ to become quite wide due to the difficultly of price discovery while all of their assets aren’t trading. This corresponds to a 30% drop in TQQQ before a temporary halt occurs.

So it is theoretically possible for TQQQ to drop more than 60% in one day. It would require that all of its holdings *not in the S&P 500* drop more than 20% in one day. Due to how many stocks are listed in both, you would need a pretty severe drop in the others (with those listed in both dropping <20%) for QQQ to drop >20% while S&P drops <20%.

So, TL;DR: it is possible for TQQQ to drop more than 60% in one day; however, it requires S&P 500 to drop less than 20% while the few (relatively) insignificant holdings of QQQ to drop significantly more than 20%. TQQQ should also not drop more than 30% in a short period of time without all of its holdings halted; price discovery at -30% will be difficult, but it should be reasonable to come up with a strategy to sell as a stop-loss just before a 30% drawdown.",[],0

There are the ultra lazy that will just put anything semi appealing on - will probably stick to the subscriptions and add to the list over time. 

Then you've got the semi-active users that look for specific stuff, they currently have a few services and are the most likely to end up torrenting a few movies at a time because they can't find them or they're on another service they don't have/want. These are the users that are likely to fall off the edge into piracy and reduce the number of services they sub to.

Then you've got ""super users"" or ""old fashioned"" who'll have their Plex server setup tailored to their wants and needs and either torrent or rip DVD/Bluray still. These probably only share a subscription if that. This is definitely <5% of all users.

There have been quite a few studies about the increased frequency of suborbital flights that’s expected to occur in the coming decades, so there clearly is concern. It hasn’t really reached the mainstream because the industry is still fledgling.

> Sure, why not? Its not like Virgin invented some new type of fuel. They use a mixture of nitrous oxide and HTPB, like several other companies and countries that build and launch rockets.

Quite possible that’s true, I asked these questions as examples of what might be unknown to the general public or experts who would be able to make a more detailed scientific assessment of the possible impact.

> I'm just saying, you're making a mountain out of an ant hill. They don't really have any reason to lie about such a minor thing. Do you really think their business would suffer significantly if they emitted more CO2 or any other pollutant?

I don’t think the impact is as minor or inconsequential as you might think. I encourage you to research it if you’re interested but one prediction states:

> The findings, reported in a paper in press in Geophysical Research Letters1, suggest that emissions from 1,000 private rocket launches a year would persist high in the stratosphere, potentially altering global atmospheric circulation and distributions of ozone. The simulations show that the changes to Earth's climate could increase polar surface temperatures by 1 °C, and reduce polar sea ice by 5–15%.

Of course a business has an objective to generate profit. They need to do that so they can survive and grow, so there's no denying that as a fundamental purpose.

There have been quite a few studies about the increased frequency of suborbital flights that’s expected to occur in the coming decades, so there clearly is concern. It hasn’t really reached the mainstream because the industry is still fledgling.

> Sure, why not? Its not like Virgin invented some new type of fuel. They use a mixture of nitrous oxide and HTPB, like several other companies and countries that build and launch rockets.

Quite possible that’s true, I asked these questions as examples of what might be unknown to the general public or experts who would be able to make a more detailed scientific assessment of the possible impact.

> I'm just saying, you're making a mountain out of an ant hill. They don't really have any reason to lie about such a minor thing. Do you really think their business would suffer significantly if they emitted more CO2 or any other pollutant?

I don’t think the impact is as minor or inconsequential as you might think. I encourage you to research it if you’re interested but one prediction states:

> The findings, reported in a paper in press in Geophysical Research Letters1, suggest that emissions from 1,000 private rocket launches a year would persist high in the stratosphere, potentially altering global atmospheric circulation and distributions of ozone. The simulations show that the changes to Earth's climate could increase polar surface temperatures by 1 °C, and reduce polar sea ice by 5–15%.

* Coal especially is a dying industry, which makes it much riskier to loan money to them in the first place. People are increasing seeing the same risks with oil companies because of what the shift to EVs and renewables will do to oil demand overtime. 

* The price of fossil fuels, especially oil, is extremely volatile, which only adds to the risk in loaning them money. A brand new oil well could look very profitable when they start to build it, but then become unprofitable by the time it's ready to start pumping oil out of the ground.

* ESG funds are increasingly powerful due to concern for climate change, so cutting them off in either loans or investment money (or both) is an easy way to boost their ESG score and help have more ESG money come into their stock.

Yes, 60% is the (target) daily max loss. The circuit break on SPY will halt *all* trading for the day at -20%, and UPRO will therefore halt at (around) -60%. This is partially the job of market makers, to find inefficiencies in the market and correct/exploit them. If SPY is trading at -15% DoD, and UPRO is trading below -45% DoD, there should exist sufficient buying pressure from market makers and other institutions to move the price closer to the true value of the ETFs holdings. This may not be exactly -45% (since UPRO’s holdings for the day may not be *exactly* tracking 3x SPY), but it should be close.

Note, however, that I stated *daily* max loss. UPRO should halt somewhere around -60%. Normally, it would be rebalanced at the end of the day; however, if the markets of its holdings are halted, it cannot be rebalanced, meaning you might be exposed to the *previous day’s* leverage the following day, leading to a “UPRO-to-0” scenario if the next day opens below -33% (relative to the previous-day’s open).

986,gzkebe4,2021-05-26,t1_gzkcso2,investing,"Not exactly what I was going for, the concern is that under capitalism the company will try to make the most money which for the airlines is apparently put as many people on each plane at the highest price you can fill them, and then fly full planes as often as possible.   You could imagine a different world (that existed when they were regulated in the 60s) where they didn't compete on price,  flew fewer people by having only one flight a week at high fares.  The rich could still fly but the rest of us would be priced out.  The airlines might even make more profits,  as long as all if them didn't try to race to the bottom and gain more market share and more profit.   

Same could also happen with wages, if another company offers me more money for the same job, I can accept that offer, but if they all offer the same low wage together,  I'm SOL.",[],0

These bonds are still trading a bit below their pandemic level, because despite issuing 450% more shares than before, AMC is still in a worse spot than before the pandemic.  Without the excess liquidity, it wouldn't have been close, though - many of those bonds would have been wiped out.

For example: One of the major investors in AMC was the super wealthy CEO of CACC - a scummy subprime car lending company that the US government is constantly going after for screwing over the poorest people in the USA.  So personally, I find that extremely distasteful.",['AMC'],1

2. Electricity can be a renewable energy. Gasoline isn't.
3. EV's are much easier to maintain because they have fewer moving parts. No oil changes and because there are fewer parts = easier to repair the more available EV's are in the market.
4. EV's will eventually be cheaper to own and purchase than ICE vehicles.
5. You can charge your EV at your home. This means unless you are traveling 300+ miles per day everyday, you will never have to visit a supercharger or charging station outside of the one in your home. 
6. There will be many charging stations opening up to replace gas stations once EV's become more popular. It's only a matter of time before ICE vehicles are obsolete.
7. You don't need to wait an hour to charge your vehicle. That's if you want maximum capacity in terms of charging your vehicle. Most EV's can charge to 80% capacity within 10-15 minutes. Plus, most charging stations are expected to be in commercial areas where people do their shopping such as supermarkets, shopping centers, etc., 

Of course, there are pros to ICE vehicles but right now, the environmental impact of ICE vehicles is why EV's are the best option for the foreseeable future. If you disagree with the environmental impact caused by ICE vehicles, that's a separate discussion. EV's will be much better all-around than ICE vehicles down the line.",[],0
