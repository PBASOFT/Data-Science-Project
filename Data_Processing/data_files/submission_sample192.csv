30,2021-05-18,stocks,I’m interested in investing into stocks but have no idea where to look at all or how it really operates. I’m willing to invest about 100-300 each paycheck to make money. End goal is to purchase a vehicle no more than 15K with a year’s worth of insurance and about 10K in the bank for extra or emergency expenses. Will I be able to see such goals by the end of this year or will it certainly take time? I’m just very lost on where to even start and how to even start a bank account and withdraw money for stocks.,nfjkov,[],0

The reopening of the world is hopefully around the corner and I am currently looking at AirBNB (ABNB) which is currently almost as low as it was when introduced. I'm thinking of going in as it seems like it has potential over the next few years.

Do you clever readers have any companies in thought that could progress in the coming reopening worth looking in to? I am not really familiar with lots of companies so this is why I ask.

All the best in these hefty times!",nfk4b2,[],1
273,2021-05-18,stocks,"The article in NYT outlines why ATT has all this horrible debt. Sounds like incompetence. All three deals were failures. And take a look at that last paragraph below. They spent over $150M just in advisory fees in 3 years to end up where they were to begin with but with more debt.  “After all of that deal-making, ATT is sitting on more than $170 billion in debt. As part of the deal with Discovery, ATT will get $43 billion to help reduce its debt load. (The spun-off media business will begin its independent life with $58 billion in debt.)”

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/18/business/ATT-WarnerMedia-Discovery.html?referringSource=articleShare


The DealBook newsletter explains how ATT got here, in three key deals:

1..A $39 billion bid to buy T-Mobile. After regulatory pushback, in 2011 ATT walked away from an effort to become the country’s largest wireless company. T-Mobile paired up instead with Sprint, and the two went on to buy huge amounts of spectrum in the high-stakes battle for 5G, leaving ATT behind as it lobbies regulators to step in. The failed deal hit ATT with a $3 billion dollar breakup fee, at the time the largest ever.

2.  The $67 billion acquisition of DirectTV. In 2015, ATT bet on cable TV as a way to amass customers whom it could eventually convert to streaming. But DirectTV bled subscribers as customers cut the cord, and ATT unloaded a stake in the company last year to TPG that valued DirectTV at about a third of its acquisition price. The deal also cost ATT about $50 million in advisory fees, according to Refinitiv.

3.  The $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. In 2018, Mr. Stephenson called the deal a “perfect match,” but the combined group struggled to invest in its telecom business while also spending enough to compete with the entertainment specialists at Netflix and Disney. Three years later, ATT is now spinning off the company so it can (re)focus on its quest for 5G market share. ATT paid $94 million in advisory fees to put the two companies together and an estimated $61 million to split them apart.",nfl6c8,[],0
301,2021-05-18,stocks,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 18, 2021**

Stocks held steady today, with the three major indexes trading within a 0.5% range of the even line. It’s encouraging to see the market holding steady after the volatility experienced in the last few weeks. As I have said before, I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, where technology stocks sank and the S&P 500 (SPY) fell 4%, was overblown for a few reasons that will be explained below. 

Last week, the market tumbled in the largest loss since February after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the April Consumer and Producer Price indexes, which showed a larger increase than expected.  The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

The PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year.

While it’s difficult to pinpoint exact causes, there seem to be several factors contributing to the rise in inflation, none of which I think pose a significant threat to the sustainability of the current bull market.  First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. 

Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. As basic economics shows us, when demand begins to outstrip production capabilities (aka supply), prices inevitably go up. One prominent example of this you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. 

Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt—incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs—recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, “Given the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying “Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.

Now that we understand why inflation may be rising, these are the reasons I think fears are overblown. With the US economy reopening, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Moreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

**Highlights**

* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fourth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. 
* In a Ford factory in Michigan, President Biden promoted his $174 billion plan to promote and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles across the United States and planned to roll-back vehicle emission standards. According to the fact sheet, Biden's plan ""proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States” and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories ""to build advanced vehicles and parts.""
* Michael Burry, the investor famous for calling the 2008 housing market bubble and portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie “The Big Short”, recently unveiled a huge bearish bet on Tesla. Scion Asset Management, Burry’s firm, said in a regulatory filing it had put options on 800,100 shares of Tesla, as of the end of Quarter 1, a value of $534 million. Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they are part of a broader trade are not publicly available. 
* Square (SQ), one of the leading fintech companies, launched services in Ireland, it’s first foray into the Eurozone as the company looks to expand beyond the US.
* Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has sold nearly all of its Wells Fargo (WFC) stock, a position the company has held since 1989. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire said it owned just $26.4 million of shares of WFC as of March 31, down from around $32 billion in January 2018.

## What is Oatly?

Oatly is a Swedish vegan milk maker, producing a sustainable alternative to dairy products using oats. It was formed in the 1990s following research from Lund University, which led Oatly to patent its enzyme technology that turns oats into a milk substitute.

## When is the Oatly IPO?

Oatly’s [IPO](https://www.forex.com/en/market-analysis/latest-research/what-is-an-ipo/) is expected to take place on Thursday 20 May 2021, listing its shares under 'OTLY' on Nasdaq. Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Credit Suisse are the underwriters.

The company Oatly announced on Tuesday 23 February that it had submitted a confidential filing for an IPO with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The offering is expected to take place following the SEC’s review, depending on market conditions.

Oatly’s IPO would raise money to fund growth, as well as a chance for existing investors to cash in on their holdings.

TTWO has long been my favorite video game developer and is an exceptionally well run company. They have no debt and very healthy cash flow.

713,2021-05-18,stocks,"Hi everyone,

I'm new to investing in stocks, and would really appreciate your help.

I keep hearing how the current market is likely to be overvalued and all signs are pointing to a bubble. Analysts are warning it could be worse DotCom bubble, etc, with companies propped up on stimulus money despite the troubles of Covid. Apparently Warren Buffet and others have all suggested we will soon see a bear market, but it's impossible to know whether that will be next week or 2030.

With that in mind, my current strategy is value investing for a 1 to 2 year window. I'm looking for massively undervalued stocks (currently my main pick is VIAC) and putting my money there, with the idea that they will outperform the indexes when the dip happens in future.

After the dip, I'd love to go long-term and buy the SNP, chuck in some AAPL and MSFT and some electric car ETFs, but I'm worried if I do that now the arse will fall out of this thing and I'll be left buying at the top of a collapsed market.

So far, there are only three buys I regret:

3) INTC - This has turned out to be a surprise disappointment at this time. In my pre-entry research, Intel had a reputation for being a safe, reliable company that would continue to steadily climb. Unfortunately, after about two days of small gains, Intel has done nothing but tumble. Still, I’m optimistic for its long term because it’s Intel, so I’m holding it.

2) MRNA - Chalk this one up to bad luck. I bought Moderna to chase its earnings report, but the timing couldn’t have been worse: I got in literally MINUTES before the Biden administration announced that the US wouldn’t protect COVID vaccine patents. In a snap, MRNA tumbled 20 points, and to add insult to injury, its earnings report disappointed. Thankfully, it’s only 5 shares, but I’m stuck holding them until MRNA can climb back to 178 again.

1) TSLA - Chalk this one up to being a total n00b. I bought TSLA on my 5th day in the market. I only had enough for one share, but I had to have it. Tesla had been surging for two straight days, and it looked poised to surge again for a third. I was thinking “easy $15 at least.” It turns out I wound up buying it at its peak. Since then, my one share of TSLA has tumbled $200, and with its unpredictability, who knows what direction it’s headed in?
