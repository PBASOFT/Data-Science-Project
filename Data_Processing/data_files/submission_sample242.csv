47,2021-05-27,investing,"Hi, I would like to invest a sizable chunk of my assets (~50%) into one or more index ETFs in order to replicate the world stock market in a diversified way.

Unfortunately I have noticed that even the MSCI World / MSCI ACWI / FTSE All-World ETFs have more than half of their value in the US, and in particular their biggest holdings are the (maybe overvalued) Google-Amazon-Facebook-Apple-Microsoft-Tesla.

Do you have an ETF or a strategy that is more balanced over the whole world and all the industry sectors?

I have thought about adding some European, APAC and Emerging Markets (and maybe Small Caps?) ETFs but I'm not sure about percentage allocation.

Any better suggestions?",nm8n6i,[],1
65,2021-05-27,investing,"Hi all,

Have been pondering this some time since rates were dropped down to zero last year. With rates close to zero and future increases being negative for bond prices, why wouldn't it make sense to take some money out of bonds and place it into financially healthy blue chips with reasonable (but not too high) dividends? 

By ""financially healthy"" I would typically include dividend yield between 2%-4%, payout ratio below 50% or 60%, debt to equity below 1 or preferably below 0.75,  free cash flow margin above 10%, and a solid cash balance (can't get very specific since it varies heavily by industry). These attributes typically apply to large/megacap stocks so that wouldn't be a requirement but it'd usually fit the bill. 

My thinking is that rates being at 0% negatively affect bonds in two ways: lower yield (10 year treasury is about 1.6% right now) and less upside as prices will get dinged when rates inevitably rise. Another point is that bonds underperform during bouts of inflation although that's another conversation entirely. I know that equities are obviously more volatile during recessionary periods but with so much of the upside of bonds stripped away I don't see why this wouldn't be a decent strategy as long as rates are low. 

What would some downsides be to this strategy? From a portfolio management standpoint  Would love to hear additional opinions, particularly risks that I haven't mentioned here.",nm8pt3,[],1
109,2021-05-27,investing,"I’m considering adjusting my strategy and wanted to get some thoughts on the topic.

I’m currently investing in a SP500 ETF in a taxable account at Schwab and considering switching to their SP500 mutual fund for the automatic investing feature.

I’m aware the ETF will be slightly more tax efficient but I’m thinking long term having the auto invest feature turned on will allow me to invest more and will provide a larger total balance. I’m getting married in the fall and I know how “life happens” and it’s easy to skip a month or two of contributions.

I guess this is more about behavior than math. Stick with the ETF and aim to DCA every month or set up Auto Invest and forget about it?

Note 1: I know other brokerages offer auto invest on ETF’s, but not willing to switch. I bank with Schwab also, so sticking with them.

Note 2: Planning on selling my ETF regardless as my wife has student loans we will pay off (will get long term cap gains treatment). So basically will be starting fresh and wanted to optimize my long term strategy.",nm92nw,[],1
313,2021-05-27,investing,"For the next decade Vanguard is expecting the US to deliver a 4.7% total return, and international equity to deliver a 8.1% .

The methodology they used is to look into the past decade's returns and see how much of the return was attributed to each of the following: 

* Valuation Change (P/E or P/B re-pricing)
* Earnings Growth (increase in EPS)
* Dividend yield
* Foreign Exchange.

For the past decade, 5.4% of the US over-performance over international equity was attributed to valuation change. They expect that in the next decade the valuations of US equities will contract (P/E multiples to go down).

407,2021-05-27,investing,"I've always been under the impression that you should do your passive investing in your retirement accounts -- specifically ones you can control your own investments like a Roth IRA.

However I recently saw an idea that if you use these funds as your play money you will not have to pay on the capital gains if you strike gold. Conversely though, you won't be able to cash in on tax loss harvesting.

Curious on what others think about this approach -- I think this firstly sounds like a great way to blow away your retirement savings if you make bad choices.

I personally use my personal brokerage account for general investing that bolsters my retirement accounts. My retirement accounts are like 100% passive funds and ETFs, while my personal brokerage is like 70% of those and 30% of individual stocks and things I wanted to invest in with ""play money"". 

Looking at the stocks I've done well on (AMZN, NVDA, ATVI) -- I do see the desire to do this in a Roth IRA account -- at least with a small amount of money. Saving on those capitol gains would equate to tens of thousands at times.

642,2021-05-27,investing,"I was looking at Vanguard Information Technology (VGT) holdings this afternoon, and was shocked to find that although there are 331 companies in this ETF, 36% of the entire fund consists of just two companies: Apple and Microsoft. See here: [https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/portfolio/VGT/portfolio-holdings](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/portfolio/VGT/portfolio-holdings)

The reason that I invest in ETFs is to diversify my holdings of equity securities. I've been tossing a few dollars into VGT since last year, under the assumption that since it's an ETF, my investments will be broadly diversified across the information technology industry. So here are some questions I now have:

1. Is this dramatic skewedness toward just one or two companies unusual in an ETF?
2. Does anyone care to explain why such a skewness is justified in this case?
3. What are some technology ETFs that better balances the exposure to each company in the fund, but also have near-zero expense ratios?",nmetge,['AAPL'],0

**""The New Warrants may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis.""**

I didn't know what this meant, so I looked it up.  It means you don't have to have the$10 per share to exercise the warrant.  They will take it out of the proceeds from converting all the warrants. Ask your broker if they participate.

**Example:** 

You have 1000 shares at $6 a share. Your investment is $6000.

You first receive $2.53^(1) per share. So cash payout of $2530.

Then, you receive 1040^(2) warrants for the shares with a strike price of $10^(2).

The new stock is trading at $15 a share. (Estimate from the plan)

Your brokerage exercises the warrants in full with zero cash from you.

You now have 1040 shares of new stock at $15 a share for a total value of $15,600.

But, you owe the strike money that the brokerage put up for you of $10 a share.

You owe $10400. $10400 divided by 15 is 694.

They sell and take 694 shares to repay your strike money.

Leaving you with 346 shares worth $5200.

$5200 in stock + $2530 in cash = $7730.

A profit of $1730 or 28% ROI.

\-Buy 500k of ILoveHorseShit coin

\-Wait a few minutes till the coin price explodes! You can also insert a dildo in your asshole while you wait (highly recommended)

\-The price will drop by 50%, but don't worry you still have 250k

\-Move to Panamá

Guys easiest 250k of your life! I love doing traiding.

Take care you little traders.

954,2021-05-27,investing,"Hey all,

I have been working on my own stock screener, and in the process have wanted to track ETFs vs their underlying holders to identify gainers/losers.

I had been trying to find a way of automatically pulling through ETF holdings with =importhtml etc, every post I found on Reddit related to the issue faced the same problem that holdings were pulled on websites by javascript and couldn't be easily pulled through to a spreadsheet.

Then, I found this website, and I must admit I've been pleasantly surprised with it! https://fknol.com/

For those of you who found this post looking for a way of pulling ETF holdings through, on google sheets it's:

    =IMPORTHTML(""https://fknol.com/etf/holdings/""&A1&"".php"",""table"",1) 
    
In A1 you'll have your ETF ticker

To make it neater expand the formula to:

    =index(IMPORTHTML(""https://fknol.com/etf/holdings/""&A1&"".php"",""table"",1),,2)
    
This will just pull through the column with the holding info

Assuming the above formula is in A2, you can use this formula in B2 to extract tickers automatically:

    =IF(A2="""","""",left(right(A2,len(A2)-find(""("",A2)),find("")"",right(A2,len(A2)-find(""("",A2)))-1))


With excel there's a guide [here](https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/anna-prosvetova/web-scraping-made-easy-import-html-tables-or-lists-using-google-sheets-and-excel). you can use index & the function to extract tickers as above.
