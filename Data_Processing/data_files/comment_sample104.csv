2571,gzcnkkm,2021-05-25,t1_gzbnw7d,wallstreetbets,"I get your enthusiasm but you have to realize the larger market is less moved by emotion and by facts.

The company will always try to put a positive spin on things, such as their extensive going on about the crash test info (which is good but no one cares about the details, they just want to hear 5 star and maybe it will be even better than that...) which frankly an EV pickup truck not getting 5 stars would be much more surprising. Much more critically their insufficient capital to achieve their production targets and rising costs, are real concerns that might weigh on the stock heavily. To put it simply, the company is going to go bankrupt if they can't produce sufficient revenues or fundraise soon.

Steve Burns likes talking about Tesla, but I might remind you, Tesla did many rounds of fundraising in the stock market that were very dilutive to get to where they are (including being near bankruptcy in the M3 ramp). This is not a small thing to consider. LMC is a small company trying to get to volume production their first time (ignoring for the moment the issues with whether the in-wheel motor design makes sense or not) and if comparing to Tesla which was forgiven for doing that fundraising, not sure investors in LMC will be as tolerant.

The rest... They being the only game.. Well the Tesla CT has a 6 ft bed so is a large truck, has 250 miles range and costs $39,900 versus the Endurance costing $52,500... Oh, and the CT has a stainless steel body (no rust). Of course you can get the dual-motor CT for $49,900 that has 300 miles of range (50 more than Endurance). The dual-motor CT is hopefully aimed for production late 2021 (much like I will be surprised if the Endurance is sold this year, I would be a drop less surprised if the CT is sold this year).

The van, not happening for a while as LMC will not have the money without fundraising to touch that, until they can sell the Endurance in sufficient quantities. Beta and so on, is nice and all that, but not the same as production. Also while they have aced their crash tests (I am not surprised by that) we don't have anyone driving these things, testing them in any manner or whatnot. Rather we have a mostly useless SF250 result to go with (and mind you they drove 20 mph over 40 miles, when top competitors did that same section between 50-70 mph).

Regarding the down payments, they were very unclear what they meant. So no comment. The M&A is interesting but not sure anyone will buy them without being satisfied that in-wheel motors are a viable approach. This was not addressed at all. In fact they can't address the short-seller report! Does not sound good to me. Jagdeep Singh of QS had no trouble discussing Scorpion Capitals claims by comparison.

As to the Army looking at them... well NASA looked at Blue Origin and then went with SpaceX, which led to all sorts of suits and politicking by Jeff Bezos. The government will look at many options, does not mean that you are going to get anyplace (anyone recall the US Postal Service and Workhorse group... another company Steve Burns funded... if history repeats does not bode well for RIDE).

Bottom line, I did not see much positive in the report. It was not nearly as negative as I thought it could have gone, so will give them that, but the fact is they are looking down the barrel of bankruptcy if they have any trouble getting to production and can't raise funds.

No clue what this all means for my Puts tomorrow. Stock did not fall too bad in afterhours, but then volume was low so could be sellers were holding back. We find out tomorrow. The puts cost me about $0.50 each, and at $8.65 share price their intrinsic value is $0.35, so will see.",[],1

It is a very unproven tech. The SF250 had them going 40 miles (versus 60 mile range they projected between charges) at 20 mph (when competitors averaged 50-70 mph over that stretch, based on publicly available GPS data).

Practically the parts saved by in-wheel motors vs mounted motors and it making it ""simpler"" is a pretty large overstatement. Getting  rid of a transmission, engine, and all the complex parts there is a huge deal, which is already accomplished. The main parts the in-wheel motor eliminates is the halfshafts and differential.

One summer, we went for a visit and discovered the place had been infested with rats. They'd come on a fishing boat and gorged themselves on coconut. So how do you get rats off an island, hmm? My grandmother showed me. We buried an oil drum and hinged the lid. Then we wired coconut to the lid as bait, and the rats would come for the coconut, and...they would fall into the drum. And after a month, you've trapped all the rats. But what did you do then? Throw the drum into the ocean? Burn it? No. You just leave it. And they begin to get hungry, and one by one...they will start eating each other, until there are only two left. The two survivors.

And then what - do you kill them? No. You take them and release them into the trees. But now they don't eat coconut anymore. Now they only eat rat. You have changed their nature. The two survivors. This is what she made us.

July will not moon as much, August even less so, etc.  So be careful with shit like ""I'll buy options two months out cuz they will have less theta decay than the current month ones"".  Thats true, but they will also moon less.

The options are AM settled so your options stop trading at 4pm EST but VIX keeps on trucking, the option will be expired but the value will be based on what VIX is at the following morning at open.

Like it's one thing to have a 100-bagger on GME and get rug pulled while you're doing retard calculus trying to squeeze every last cent out of the trade thinking shit like ""when it's up 40% today I'll sell"" vs ""uhhh it's already up another 38% today and you have a 10,000% return...take the money fuckface""

But it's an entirely next level of retarded to see you had **2 more entire days** where you could have settled, sold at $285, and still walked away with $75k. 

What did the play end up being though, you might ask? Yup...somehow even more retarded than *that*...roll out and buy another month of time just to eventually end up selling at $160 for a measly $24k.

This is just wrong. Tesla will make a $40K version of the CT with 250 miles of range but one motor. The dual motor will cost $50K and has 300 miles of range (Endurance has 250). The tri-motor CT which costs $70K has a 500 miles of range.  You make an assumption that having 4 in-wheel motors is important, when in fact, based on something like the SF250, it was no benefit at all. A dual motor truck is all wheel drive, just not independent all wheel drive. If anything in a tough situation, the Endurance can only put out max 150 hp to a single wheel whereas the Tesla can transfer most of the 283 hp (assuming Model 3 motors) to a single wheel by simply applying the brake to the opposing wheel (the do this with the Model S). This assumption that 4 in wheel motors gives you better ability off road to move is simply an assumption that very likely does not hold up, hence this argument that 4 in-wheel motors is better than dual-motors is simply flawed.",[],1

In the SF250, the vehicle was modified with bigger wheels. Also, the wheel hubs rely on the software to perform. Since this was the first time they tested in those conditions with bigger wheels, energy consumption wasn't on par with what they projected. They can make tweaks in the software to improve performance and they'll need to rethink using those super wheels for next year.

The wheel tech being ‘better’? Better is a word used by uneducated investors to be blunt. It provides lower maintenance costs because the problems that go wrong are easy to get at and the pieces that need replacing are less costly on average. 

No one is saying better, they are saying cheaper. Which is what fleets are after. There is also speculation that it may get better traction in pulling, but ‘most’ of their purchasers are not interested in that. 

Also, having motors in all wheels make each one really independent one from the other. The power that you can apply directly to each wheel makes a good difference in performance. Tesla is abviously the leader, but the design is shit and we dont know when that will be built. German factory is dead fish and china is cracking down on tesla.

I performed really well in the market over the last 14 months, went all cash in early March 2020 (didn’t have the balls to short the market), but I was able to effectively swing trade my ass off on a dozen fave stocks (Tesla, Beyond Meat, Snapchat, Hertz, all the airlines & cruise-ships and Virgin Galactic) so Virgin had been good to me.  When it started falling off its peak into the low 50’s I picked up some again and that started the process of averaging down.  Am I active trading this stock because I’m in love with their management and fundamentals... no.  I trade this stock because it’s an exciting category with few competitors, and it’s price moves frequently enough to have an opportunity for massive gains.  I’m not my parents holding a bunch of stable blue chips clipping dividend coupons for a return that’s on par with the S&P.  My goal is to see at least 300% annual returns and so long as these guys do not kill a crew, their stock is going to soar.

We're seeing a huge rise up from government due to us needing semiconductors that are produced locally rather then from foreign foundries.

This is a huge boon and is free cash to grow a line of business that only empowers the US and allows us to compete with China. INTEL is a computer heavyweight as is IBM, both have large research budgets and have been original in many lines of work in producing new innovations.

This is a blessing upon our country since it will allow us to have a large leap forward in tech, you can expect the next 5 years to get very crazy for everyone involved. VR and other technologies are being pushed infinitely closer due to all the progress we've made these past 5 years.

7111,gzd4fgc,2021-05-25,t3_nkj0cc,wallstreetbets,"Okay, so as a TL;DR up front + disclaimer:  I’m GME/AMC till I D.I.E., it’s not about money but rather equality, we need each other as a community more than ever, and this is NOT financial advice.  Let’s begin!

Hedge Funds, governments, financial security, has been founded on monetary gains.  The federal reserve was/is a debt based system, and over the last 100 years, we let our financial ecosystem run its course.  Where does this leave us?  With an imbalance unlike any other and the perfect storm to right 100 years of wrong. 

It really is amazing, I’m an IT Director, and technology never ceases to amaze me. Out technological revolution on the scale of existence is like we invented fire a million times over in a week’s time.  We have come together to be the collective power, mind, soul, being true to our instinct of a pack. Reddit proved this, that’s why THIS, this future, this coming battle against the power and wealth, is the first example of how we can unite.  How we ARE smarter together!

That’s great and we will win and burn these fuckers funds, but wait... that’s the immediate future, what about the aftermath?  The loss of their wealth, which they hoarded, don’t get me wrong, but they also gave a measly percentage to our economy/retirement/false financial freedom.  So we take them down, and bet I’m taking them down regardless, but that ripple effect will trigger a normal that the rest of the world will feel. 

This is MORE than their demise, it’s a true revolution.  I seriously thought, and don’t tell me when riots were all about after months of a lockdown, you didn’t think there was going to a civil war, that COVID would have pushed to a reform.  But it didn’t.  But, odds are, this WILL!

Food for thought:  What if the government bails them out, fucks our funds and it’s back to square one.  They’ve done it before.   Pay billions in bonuses and give them more billions, all while our cities suffer. Our health suffers.  Our wealth suffers...  would you let them fuck you again, and again, and again...  what about again?  When do you actually fuck them?? When you get $1 million a share (REMEMBER: I’m holding till HF’s tank, every ape is a millionaire, and justice has been restored), but these fuckers are the ones in power, making decisions.   All this we have done, are doing, and are willing to die for... it’s obvious for me we are changing the world, but be prepared for the smoke and mirrors to fall. (In which case, a revolt will form)

What’s that mean?  Let’s not get greedy with wealth for Lambos, Rolexes, million dollar yachts with your wife’s boyfriend as the butler,  but instead KEEP our camaraderie!  Keep looking out for each other. We have the technology to be smarter as a whole. Stop letting ancient, pre-tech, beliefs rule us. We are better, smarter, stronger because we can ALL come together and we are living proof of this!! 
 
Has anyone thought about the aftermath?  Just saying...  We NEED each other, now, later, and forever.  My point is, post- squeeze, let’s all keep our composure and remember where we came from and why we are doing this.  I love you all!!  

Thanks for reading. 🙏🏼",['AMC'],1

She went to the vets today. Her ligaments in one of her legs are utterly fucked. She's getting a operation to hopefully rectify it but it'll be a fairly long recovery if successful (probably 3 months-ish).

if the operation fucks up (it's not a high % success rate) at the very least she won't get put down, which is what I feared most, but she will lose use of that leg for the rest of her life. 

Considering she loves to run, that's unfortunate, but I believe she will still be happy, and my parents said it's unlikely that they will consider putting her down

7363,gzd5k9r,2021-05-25,t3_nkj8bb,wallstreetbets,"Okay, so as a TL;DR up front + disclaimer:  I’m GME/AMC till I D.I.E., it’s not about money but rather equality, we need each other as a community more than ever, and this is NOT financial advice.  Let’s begin!

Hedge Funds, governments, financial security, has been founded on monetary gains.  The federal reserve was/is a debt based system, and over the last 100 years, we let our financial ecosystem run its course.  Where does this leave us?  With an imbalance unlike any other and the perfect storm to right 100 years of wrong. 

It really is amazing, I’m an IT Director, and technology never ceases to amaze me. Our technological revolution on the scale of existence is like we invented fire a million times over in a week’s time.  We have come together to be the collective power, mind, soul, being true to our instinct of a pack. Reddit proved this, that’s why THIS, this future, this coming battle against the power and wealth, is the first example of how we can unite.  How we ARE smarter together!

That’s great and we will win and burn these fuckers funds, but wait... that’s the immediate future, what about the aftermath?  The loss of their wealth, which they hoarded, don’t get me wrong, but they also gave a measly percentage to our economy/retirement/false financial freedom.  So we take them down, and bet I’m taking them down regardless, but that ripple effect will trigger a normal that the rest of the world will feel. 

This is MORE than their demise, it’s a true revolution.  I seriously thought, and don’t tell me when riots were all about after months of a lockdown, you didn’t think there was going to a civil war, that COVID would have pushed to a reform.  But it didn’t.  But, odds are, this WILL!

Food for thought:  What if the government bails them out, fucks our funds and it’s back to square one.  They’ve done it before.   Pay billions in bonuses and give them more billions, all while our cities suffer. Our health suffers.  Our wealth suffers...  would you let them fuck you again, and again, and again...  what about again?  When do you actually fuck them?? When you get $1 million a share (REMEMBER: I’m holding till HF’s tank, every ape is a millionaire, and justice has been restored), but these fuckers are the ones in power, making decisions.   All this we have done, are doing, and are willing to die for... it’s obvious for me we are changing the world, but be prepared for the smoke and mirrors to fall. (In which case, a revolt will form)

What’s that mean?  Let’s not get greedy with wealth for Lambos, Rolexes, million dollar yachts with your wife’s boyfriend as the butler,  but instead KEEP our camaraderie!  Keep looking out for each other. We have the technology to be smarter as a whole. Stop letting ancient, pre-tech, beliefs rule us. We are better, smarter, stronger because we can ALL come together and we are living proof of this!! 
 
Has anyone thought about the aftermath?  Just saying...  We NEED each other, now, later, and forever.  My point is, post- squeeze, let’s all keep our composure and remember where we came from and why we are doing this.  I love you all!!  

Thanks for reading. 🙏🏼",['AMC'],1

A battery is no different from an electric motor, from a fridge or from other things you use every day.
Cobalt mines (cobalt is really used less and less each day) are no different from copper mines, iron mines or diamond mines, or uranium mines or gold mines.
All mines, especially copper and gold are a fucking post apocalyptic wasteland. Copper mines extend for 100 of miles, gold uses toxic chemicals that gets released in the environment.

The long term ecological side of things doesn't exists for mines, unless you consider old-world mines (asteroid mining, etc).

And everyone that thinks that cobalt is an outsider regarding pollution, should visit a copper mine or an iron mine and do a little homework.
Or hell, even an aluminium mine.

Battery are better for the environment because they have an efficiency >98%. And brushless motor have an efficiency >90%.
That way, the pollution you create while producing a 500 kg thing will be offset by the higher efficiency over longer lifetime.

CNG gets liquefied by compressing it to around 200 bar.
And to store it safely you are using a tank that is 1,5 cm thick. That tank weights around 100kg and stores around 13kg of liquid methane.
In italy methane for cars is quite common, I've owned a methane car for years.

But, I can assure you that hydrogen is another matter.
If you want to store it in liquid form, you have to compress it to 800 bar.
And the hydrogen molecule is so fucking tiny that it goes through steel and basically any other matter in the world. It's like filling a balloon with thousands of small holes. You fill it and hope to consume it before it goes all away.
What this means is that you must have an over engineered tank, just to store a couple kg of hydrogen.
Hydrogen that you'll need to use to produce motion. 
How? Burning it in an ICE brings you the same efficiency of an ICE motor(35-40%) with 700% more engineering problems.
Using it into a fuel cell brings you the fuel cell efficiency (70-85%) with 600% more engineering problems.

So, hydrogen ships? Probable.

Ivy is their cloud based software system that integrates AWS(multi year partnership with Amazon web services) that could revolutionize the driver experience as we know it. The potential is huge imo.

The hyperinflation in the US has already started & every G bought to keep peoples savings value & ensure access to staples puts the value of GME up by the same amount, no more Gold (Capital) ball drop free trade deficit induced busts to free up homes from out of work Red (Populist) homeowners, GameStop.

3 supply side shocks; announce, launch, flee to G's & then a final economic atomic because we are so done with Blue (Capitalists) owning the mechanism of Capitalism itself & abusing it to 'leverage' Gold (Capital) from the wage sl@ve Black (Nationalist) renters who actually produce. Labour scarcity from economic progression is necessary for species survival because it induces capital labour substitution development, when they raise 'rents' & staples prices in line with wage growth they doom humanity to a high labour low capital developing nation wage sl@ve Hell just waiting for the next dinosaur meteor.

 GME is a brand & that brand deserves a platform of equal size & matching the ambition of its shareholders, one that we were working on before Blues pulled the swarm in with a Gold ball drop & tried to leave them holding the bag or trick them into silver to eat them with a supply side shock. No one deserves this more than the deathgrippers who lost hope but kept faith with each other & we will be counting on their shares to take the brand from Blue (Capitalist) control when the time comes so buy a Golden ticket & enjoy the nominal price ride, we got the real price.

With theta decay and good technicals on SPY I'd probably wait and make a similar play in line with next months Fed comments and PMI data and use futures and signals of potential market panic to decide when to hit the button.

If there's any drivers for a possible dump you'll know about it a day before so just buy an itm put the day before and see where it goes. If the data is good you can buy it back for virtually no loss and try again next fed talk/pmi.

This follows a day of gains on Monday as the Nasdaq gained 1.4% and S&P 1%. 

Some talk this is due to ‘inflation anxiety relief’ after Fed speakers yesterday reiterated (again) they weren’t concerned about inflation. But not really seeing that. It may be much simpler. Listen to the podcast for my reasons why.

Today we have housing data and consumer confidence figures on deck. The Case-Schiller home price index is out first at 0900, with economists expected a 12% YoY increase, which would be the fourth straight month of double digit gains. (No inflation?)

New home sales for May are due at 1000, with the consensus estimate calling for 970k, a drop from last month’s 1,021k which was the highest we’ve seen in years. If the actual number beats that you should see inflation concerns return to the fore.

Also at 1000: Consumer confidence for May is expected to come in at 119.2, a slight dip from April’s 121.7. We’ve been shattering post-pandemic highs there for a couple of months so not sure why things would dip. Maybe inflation?",[],0

The world is going to treat the country differently once everyone realizes that COVID was their fault and they benefited significantly from it.

Released from a lab.

Didn't really do much to keep it from spreading internationally.

Started hoarding PPE and sucking the supply from other nations.

Made PPE one of their strategic priorities BEFORE the pandemic.

Gouged other countries with PPE and sent crappy quality items for protection when they exported items.

They recoverd more quickly and benefited significantly from the pandemic as exports weren't hurt in their country.

And now are vaccinating aggressively because they know that they'll have to reopen if they want to compete internationally now. Funny how the whole strategy of helping other countries went by the wayside as the vaccination rates in competitor countries started rising quickly.

Don't get it twisted, they have real debt issues and a demographic cliff to deal with besides significant potential for client countries to reshore production away from China.

India is a threat. Taiwan is not going to be under their control without a fight now that Trump is out of office. And the TPP is potentially back on the table.

A reduction in GDP combined with significant debt and malinvestment in real estate is a big risk.

Then you add the fact that they fake the financials for a ton of their companies.

But a few days later IG allowed selling and blocked buying for GME, and then IG's shutout lasted way longer than robinhood's. On top of that they now limit take profit market orders to just 20% above current market price, ""for market stability"" which is complete bullshit.

I'm not sure why u/JayJayAksi selfwealth is evil? Are you saying you're bothered by the $3000 limit? They seem far better than any other alternative I know of. I might consider switching to them from IG to be honest.",['GME'],0
