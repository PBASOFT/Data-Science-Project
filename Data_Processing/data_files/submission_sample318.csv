343,2021-05-26,stocks,"If there are thoughts both PROS and CONs regarding this mega deal please feel free to comment. I want all the minds on Reddit to try and make some sense out of this....

When this deal was announced May 17th DISCA and T were on fire. Premarket I was watching shares catch fire and go above $43 on DISCA. Later on during the day, I did decide to start trading it as it fell to $34. In my opinion close to $34-35 is a fair value for the stock without a deal!

DISCA now has 15 + million subscribers for their 4.99 service. Expectations were for 8. We all know the streaming is the wave. As we see also with Netflix and Disney there is enough for them all provided we have rich content. In the most recent report DISCA beat on top line and said that the streaming business added 4 million subs in just the last 2 months. This business is alot more profitable. Current bottom line is about 2.79 for the year, next year is about 3.25 without factoring in the rapid streaming and more profitable side of the business. This yields a PE ratio of this year near 11 and next year under 10! Doesn't that sound cheap for a large company that will grow sales between 10-15%?

This is all before the Warner Media deal.... So in my mind DISCA is worth 34-35.... On it's own its executing and turning the business around.....so now with Adult Swim, Boomerang, Cartoon Network, CNN, TBS, TNT, TruTV, Turner Classic Movies, Turner Sports, HBO..... now its worth less?

I understand we won't be able to see the full details and synergies yet.... this deal may or may not even close! It will be at least 6 months out.... but in the mean time DISCA which has been delivering is getting crushed? This combines to be close to a 50 billion company...... Unfortunately, T paid over 85 billion, and there is still alot of debt. But please help me figure out how DISCA isnt worth at least 35..... 

Should we just can the deal and fight to stop the merger? Is that what the market is saying? That combining all that and maybe charging 14.99 for HBO and Discovery + and maybe having 100 million subscribers is not good?...... Do we see what it is doing for DISNEY? Just shaking my head here.

622,2021-05-26,stocks,"Hello everyone. As we all know China is extremely populated and they definitely lover their bikes. They are much more affordable than cars. They are much less space. They are cheaper than gas and most importantly pretty much anyone, any age can use a bike! I tried to research as much as I could the exact number of bikes in China but I could not find that unfortunately. The 600 million estimate was as close I could find.

Most importantly we may be able to make an investment. EZGO is the Ebike and IPO’ed early on in January. The execution from the company has been amazing. However, the stock has come down a lot. The figures yesterday 5/24/2021 given by the CEO were 6 months thru March 31st of 2021 and did not even include some big deals. 

Let me go thru some important highlights and insights from the CEO:

**Revenue grew 224% to $16.8 Million from just $5.2 Million**

**Projected sales of 100,000 bikes in 2021 (Which was given February 17th)**

**Sales of the 2 wheel bicycles increased 50% to 23,000 units while the 3 wheel increased 600% to 11,000 units! Total of 34,000 units. (5/24/2021 The CEO gave this update and said sales have increased drastically and it expects rapid revenue growth)** 

***These numbers were for ending March 31st and does not Include the following!!!***

**4/1/2021 EZGO reports a large order from the Ukraine the stock spikes to 9.48!** **These bikes are to be delivered in April!**

**4/15/2021 EZGO signs a new contract for 10,000 Bikes after an exhibition displaying their bikes**

Their higher end bike sells for about $300 US dollars and travels 225 miles on a single charge. Most bikes are about $200 and have 150-200 Mile range. You can go to their website EZGOtech, I do not want to get banned by including links. The bikes look great!

At 100,000 bikes, could be more and 300 a bike we are looking at 30 million in sales………which is 100% growth again……. I believe that estimate is light!

877,2021-05-26,stocks,"I personally think all these companies: Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon are all really good companies. But, IF YOU HAD TO INVEST IN ONLY ONE OF THEM. Which one would you invest in and why? 

They’re all huge, still growing, and making a lot of money. I am invested in all of them. Wasn’t a fan of Facebook, still not, yet I can’t deny that from an investing perspective they are a strong company. While I thought Facebook was dying and just for moms and dads, they got Instagram which everyone my age loves and used. They monetized their offerings tremendously well. Every time I thought they’re on a down hill from social pressures, they shoot back up. 

Microsoft was my favorite holding. I love Nadella, I love his vision. He played a tremendous role into turning Microsoft around and into the company that it is today. Their cloud services are growing and I believe are second behind AWS. They have their productivity and business sector which is compromised of office. Office changed was pushed towards a subscription model, one with better profit-margins.  As and end user I’m not a fan of this, but to get through college I needed those subscriptions. Their personal computing segment has been growing with their surface line. While I personally have a surface pro, I don’t love it. Yet since I got it they have been updating their line and have been putting pressure on the competition. I’m also excited for their gaming division. Not only their Xbox but how they are offering a new gaming experience. While I believe it almost may be redundant to get an Xbox if you have a gaming pc, how they’re connecting players on Xbox and pc may be the better option long term (potentially). 

Apple has been making amazing iPhones. While they have not been revolutionary model to model, people love their ecosystem. That’s the biggest thing for me. People love iPhones. They love MacBooks. Show me a college white girl without a MacBook, good luck. They go better together than a college white girl and starbucks. Also they are expanding offerings in their ecosystem. Their offerings are very easy to use, simple yet not plain, and a premium product. This is a company that has been consistently delivering amazing products. 

Alphabet, I’m not really sure what they do. Googles search engine I’m not sure anyone will ever overtake them. They are consistently adapting and improving it. They a make ton of ad revenue not only from google but YouTube. The more we use their products, the more data they collect, the better they know us and can profit of us. They I love YouTube ads? No. Are they making a ton of money of us? Yes. Also, they have a big R&D budget. That puts me at peace about their future, that they are eager to grow and not satisfied with that they have achieve. 

Amazon I believe of all companies has been spending the most on R&D. Their AWS Is leading and growing. From my understanding Azure still has a lot of catching up to do in terms of product quality and offerings. In fact, I would love Amazon even without their online market place. I really love Amazon For their AWS. I believe it brings in most of their profit. 

I don’t believe any of these companies are perfect, some of their products I don’t like, some of their fundamentals I’m not a fan of; yet, overall I think each of these companies has a lot of strengths.

Eight months ago, I made my first ""call of calls"" on a blockbuster event amongst reverse mergers.  Eight months ago, I made the ""call of calls"" on what was then a different ticker, and what now belongs to Lordstown Motors (RIDE).

And indeed, RIDE went on to become the fourth of nine realized blockbuster events amongst reverse mergers.

Then came Workhorse's loss of the USPS contract.  That was nothing, as production could continue on the main EV product.  Lordstown Motors could still take on Ford and its F-150.

Then came the Hindenburg short report.  RIDE became the second of three realized blockbuster events shorted by Hindenburg.  Like, really?

Then came the announced production delays recently, most likely due to semiconductor shortages.  The commercial EV startup's chances against Ford got dashed big time.

Then came something bigger and more unfortunate for RIDE bagholders: Rivian is just another EV startup.  Ford is a typical Big Auto laggard in EVs.

Not so the Next Tesla.

Not so the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, its proven track record in the commercial pickup truck business, and [now its own foray into EV pickup trucks](https://motorillustrated.com/volkswagen-trademarks-amarok-is-compact-pickup-coming/76784/), semiconductor shortages be damned.

958,2021-05-26,stocks,"I started looking at Lithia Motors ($LAD) in the past couple of weeks.  They're an automotive retailer here in the states with a Market Cap of $10.37b.  Their growth is in main accomplished through M&A of other dealerships.  

* Downsides include: 
   * susceptibility to economic downturns, 
   * if interest rates climb it will make it harder for them to offer attractive financing,
   * 2020 supply chain shortages interrupting inventory,
   * High debt levels,
   * Competitive advantages, as I see them currently, are limited:
      * small pricing advantage over smaller competitors,
      * limited protection in certain markets where regulations or distributor arrangements keep their competitors out for certain vehicle brands.
* Fundamental Numbers:
   * Free Cash Flow - went positive for the last 4 years. They ended 2020 with $381m in FCF. 
      * CAGR on FCF from 2017 to 2020 equaled 86.4%.
   * From 2010 to 2020
      * Revenue grew from $2b to $13.1b (CAGR 20.5%).
      * BVPS CAGR was 24.7% (2020 BVPS of $111.83).
      * EPS CAGR was 43.7% (2020 EPS of $19.53).
      * ROE in 2020 was 25.6% (CAGR 19.2%)
   * Total Debt in 2020 was $4.175b
   * Long-term debt was $2.311b 
   * LT Debt to Earnings = 4.92

The last few numbers are very concerning to me.  That's a whole lot of debt they are carrying!  Combined with limited economic moats.... Hmmmm.  However, I did compare their 2020 numbers to Carmax, one of their biggest competitors.  Carmax had a whooping LT Debt/Earnings ratio of 20.7, revenue of roughly $19b, and EPS of $4.52.  Carmax's growth number were also much less overall.

Given their LT debt/Earnings was roughly 1/4 of a direct competitor's and their growth numbers were looking good to me, I was continuing to do some reading and research.  Then Lithia made a rather big announcement.  They're doing a new public offering of shares valued at $1b.  At the same time they announced a private offering of $800 million in senior notes (3.875%) that would be due 2029...  Nearly another billion in LT Debt?!?!?  ARRGGHHHHH!

Looking at their 2021 Q1 presentation, they do give target uses of capital, which at least shows they have a plan that they are willing to publish.  Those plans are as follows:    

* Internal Investment & Modernization 25% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 17%) 
* Share Repurchases 5%
   * (Actual 5-year average: 11%) 
* Dividends 5% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 4%) 
* Acquisitions 65% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 68%) 

Their stated goal in the 2021 Q1 for acquisitions is an annual addition of $3-5 billion in revenues.  They also posted good numbers for Q1 YoY and compared to the previous quarter.  However, with the debt now I feel like the research rabbit hole has gotten a little deeper for me....

I suppose the silver lining is that the 2 valuations of the company I ran and margin of safety puts them outside of my current buy range.  So I've got the time for the research.",nl8xqa,[],0
