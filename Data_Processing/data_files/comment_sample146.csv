31,gz6qz9y,2021-05-23,t1_gz60m5f,investing,"Honestly, both. Play both sides and diversify. 

Buy a S&P 500 ETF and you're getting a mix of value and growth. You can choose to be a little more aggressive towards growth when you're younger and you think the bull market will keep going. You can achieve that by buying small amounts of SPYG (which is the growth stocks of SPY) or buying QQQ (NASDAQ) into your portfolio.

Growth stocks have out performed value the last decade or two. Value from 1927 to today, when dividends are reinvested, have largely outperformed growth over the long-run.

This is better thought of in terms of risk.  Growth stocks are riskier, but they can mean they come with greater potential rewards. When times are good they generally go up in price more. When times are bad they generally fall deeper. Investors are pricing in what companies can become in the future, not what they are now at this very minute. 

Value stocks don't go up as much or down as much,comparatively, but often can give some direct profits to the shareholders along the way.

You want those extra gains during large bull markets, but you don't want to be holding a 100% growth stocks when we enter a recession.

Right now commodities prices are at ATH because of massive undersupply. However supply is getting built out at a crazy rate and the demand spike for a lot of these goods is likely temporary.
This isn't new or unusual, commodities super-cycles are they are known are fairly frequent phenomena. Some people get very rich on the way up, some people get left with some very heavy bags and a few people get very rich on the way down.

Correction in commodities pricing will be violent and brutal. Similar to the bond market commodities are traded using highly levered products called futures so when the crash starts happening (it already has) it will go down very fast.

The other bubble which is probably a year or 2 out from peaking is semiconductor stocks. For now supply is constrained but fabs are being built out massively on a scale never seen before. Again this isn't new, semis have a boom/bust cycle like commodities. It's just this one is much bigger and will take longer to play out.

Unlike commodities, bonds or crypto this one will take a lot longer to deflate. I expect NVDA, AMAT and ASML to be hit the hardest by this.

92,gz6utqu,2021-05-23,t1_gz52kgu,investing,"Technically neither. But closer to the first one. Lets assume the dividend is paid quarterly. To calculate dividend yield, they would take the LAST dividend, multiply it by 4 (which simply assumes it continues to be paid every quarter going forward) and divide it by the current share price. 

However, the important things to realize are:
1) There's no guarantee the dividend continues to be paid out. Generally companies try to keep a steady dividend, but hard times can definitely force them to lower or discontinue it.
2) The stock price could move down. If you buy a dividend stock with a 3% yield, and the share price goes down 10% over the year, you're still at -7% on the investment. If a company is paying a dividend, but not making money, you can expect the value of the company (shares) to decline a little each time they pay out that dividend, because they're basically bleeding off the value of the company and they have no cash flow to replace it.

So, a really high dividend yield can be a red flag. That means the market isn't counting on that dividend to continue to pay out, generally speaking. It's similar to how borrowers (and companies) that are sketchy have to pay high interest rates. The high interest is to account for the high risk that they won't pay it back. So don't see a 8% dividend yield and think, ""great, a guaranteed 8% return over the next year"". There's a reason investors aren't buying up that stock despite the strong dividend (paid in the PAST).",[],0

249,gz74axx,2021-05-23,t3_nj9vfs,investing,"Hydrogen seems like a promising alternative for energy storage (and in Europe seems like its going to be the main focus) but I feel like other batteries such as Zinc-Air / Redox Flow batteries can become important especially to fill in the gap in > 8 hours energy storage. They are still being developed (someone already mentioned $*MGXRF / $ZAIR - Zinc8* in the comments) but from what little DD I've done on this company and subject these are some of the conclusions:

1. **Zinc is a readily available and cheap material**
2. **Reusability** \- none of the materials in the battery are actually consumed and as opposed to Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) batteries  they dont have the problem of becoming less efficient with time. If they did become less efficient it would be a matter of renewing the electrolytes as opposed to having to change the whole battery.
3. **Better scalability than Li-Ion batteries -** to scale Li-Ion you basically have to add more stacks of batteries but with Zinc - Air batteries you can simply increase the volume of the tanks containing the electrolytes which makes it cheaper (the caveat being that since they are less energy dense the break even point with Li-Ion battery is at *above 8 hours of energy storage* \- in simpler terms if you need to store ***less*** than 8 hours of energy you're better off with Li-Ion)
4. **Safer -** unlike Li-Ion or Hydrogen these batteries ***don't*** require a controlled environment to operate and aren't flamable which also means that security measures are less strict on sites where these are installed. This in turn also makes them cheaper to deploy.
5. **Still in infancy** \- the technology is in development, has yet to prove it's worth and aren't commercially widespread yet. A few of them are being implemented in defferent places (NYC and Australia are testing them for now) but feels like it could be promising.

I might've missed something so if you want to add to this feel free to do so!

If you're waiting for a stock to go down and want to buy if it goes **below** a certain level, use a limit buy order. If you're watching a stock and you'd prefer not to buy it right now, but if it ever goes **above** a certain level, then you want to buy some (so that you can own some before it goes up even further), use a stop-limit buy order.

So if the current price is 50 and you want to buy as soon as it goes down to 40, set a limit order (""buy N shares if price is 40 or below""). But if the price is 50 and you want to buy in case the price goes above 60 (because you think if it ever goes above 60 that would be because of some dramatic good news that means it would be likely to keep going up well over 60), set a stop-limit order with a stop-price of 60 and a limit of, say, 70. So then if the price goes over 60 you'll automatically enter a ""buy N shares if price is 70 or below"" order. So unless the price shoots immediately from below 60 to above 70, you'll get your N shares at a price between 60 and 70.

Hwang and Wood both worked in environments where their investment styles were too risky/volatile.  So with this very little experience they ventured off on their own and got clobbered in less than a decade.

Her remarks about Bitcoin remind me of the common fallacy to which real estate investors subscribe.  In the long run the market will always go up because inflation goes up, everything goes up, but the fluctuations that are profitable in the shorter term are subject to the availability of extant investment capital.

By extant I mean that government creation of additional capital comes at a cost.  That cost is inflation.  Valuations well in excess of fair value cannot rise infinitely because those excess valuations are fueled by excess capital.  When excess capital shrinks, excess valuations shrink first.

Wood is nothing like Buffett not because of her investing record but because of her *ethos*.  Neither she nor Hwang have been around long enough to understand and appreciate the reasoning behind Graham's definition of investing.  That is:

>An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.

3. Being a very light and small molecule, hydrogen will diffuse right through metal tank walls. It's not leaking...it's diffusing right through the metal. Fill a perfectly intact tank with hydrogen and wait and the pressure will drop.

However, I am somewhat interested in a related technology: ammonia manufacturing using hydrogen from water electrolysis combining it with nitrogen in the air. Right now we make most ammonia from methane gas using steam reforming and the Haber Bosch process. 

We use a lot of liquid ammonia for crop fertilization and chemical processes and eventually need to get that off of fossil fuel sources.

Basically, a battery systems capacity was derated from peak output to the max output that could be sustained over a minimum runtime. PJM also proposed shifting to an effective load carrying capability approach, which, though not accepted by FERC for the moment, would measure the amount of load a storage system's capacity could offset.

Assuming you want the names you have I would go through them from smallest holding to biggest and ask: why am I holding, what else do I have that fits the thesis, has the the thesis been working, if so do I add (with the proceeds of another sale) and if not let's sell (and use proceeds to add elsewhere)

You've got so many that it will take months to work through. At the end, you'll have a more focused list, you'll know the thesis for each and you might have cash to invest. During this time, you'll have come across other names, and you will not have invested. But you can now deep dive on them, establish their thesis and start adding.

Live in one, rent the other, and unless you're in California or something where the prices are insane, your net costs could well be less than you had been paying in rent, plus if the value of your home goes up, the equity gains can be worth more than the rent.

That said, housing prices are generally really high right now, at least in the US, so personally I wouldn't buy any real estate until the next significant dip in housing prices comes. So I'd suggest, stick your money some place relatively safe where you can get it out quickly when you want it (say an index fund), start following your local housing market closely (visit lots of open houses so you start to get a feel for what problems houses can have and how much they're selling for), and then buy your duplex in a year or two when you start to see headlines about housing prices falling,",[],1

506,gz7ld8j,2021-05-23,t1_gz7iitk,investing,"Starting off, I would recommend putting in all the money you can to match your Employers match in your 401k. Not taking advantage of the match is just leaving free money on the table.

After your 401k match, I would recommend doing a back door Roth IRA - with an income over 150k, you can‚Äôt contribute to a normal Roth IRA, but you can still do something called an back door Roth IRA, which will let you put 6k into a Roth IRA.

Finally after that, max out your contribution to your 401k. Your 401k will allow you to grow your retirement money tax free, until you withdraw (which will then tax you)

So after filling up your Roth IRA and 401k (about 25,500), I would put the rest into a taxable account (normal brokerage account). The beauty of the Roth and 401k is that the money can all grow tax free - which lets it grow faster. For a taxable, growth is slower since transactions are taxed, so you want to put your money in this last. In addition - 401k money is tax deductible, so you save even more there.

Regarding investments - your 401k will have employer sponsored investments - unfortunately, your choices will vary depending on what you pick. For a Roth/taxable, you have pretty much any choice you want. I recommend index funds - they allow broad diversification of the market, at low costs. The general most recommended one is VTSAX - which invests in the entire United States Stock market. Unless the US collapses, this will increase in value over the next decades. 

This is the most consistent method with the least effort. Unfortunately, duplex house hacking has its own pros and cons that I don‚Äôt know too much about. Some others might be able to talk about that, but the strategy above is the best general advice",[],0

Batteries are part of the SWB (Solar, Wind, Batteries) megatrend and a huge amount of resources are currently being poured into their construction and development. Additionally, the idea that we need days worth of stored power in order to ensure continuous operation of the grid is outdated and obsolete.

Most likely outcome currently is interconnected smart grids consisting of multiple renewables sources with some degree of overcapacity and grid storage. In the EU, billions have been put aside to upgrade the power interlinks between all the countries to make this happen, for instance. Using a combination of solar, wind (offshore and onshore), traditional hydro power and potentially wave/tide power with storage should cover most scenario's. 

A ""trick"" that has recently been deployed in several countries is also paying heavy industry to shut down. In the Netherlands a smelter that uses as much energy as a city of 200,000 people has a contract with the utilities to shut down during peak demand. It's an order of magnitude cheaper than putting in a battery with equal capacity. These kinds of adaptations will make it so that grid energy storage will be much less than previously anticipated and can be filled by batteries.

There's a lot of noise about hydrogen currently, but the first application for hydrogen would probably be shipping, and maybe aircraft.

Eventually, Buffett did finally get a slot on his firm.  And by his mid-thirties he was closing up Buffett Partners Ltd. to acquire a failing textile business which continued to underperform into the late 70's.   It wasn't until Black Monday (the market crash of 1987) that Buffett's Berkshire-Hathaway went into the stratosphere.

But let's take a step back... Buffett was an exceptionally shrewd person and if we say he purchased his first securities at age 11, and he ran a coin operated soda machine business which was arguably more lucrative, then he had 23 years of business experience before acquiring Berkshire-Hathaway and would have to wait another 23 years after that before it became truly successful.

And even then, he has famously said it was his biggest error, for if instead of acquiring the whole textile business he had directly invested the acquisition cost in insurance businesses, he would be $200 billion richer.

>A typical undergrad degree is way too slow for me

What Buffett had that you don't is not just an education and expertise, but immense patience.

If your issue is that you're too old, then accept that you cannot be all things.  You've obviously had a career.  You've made money that has given you investment capital.  Put it in an index fund.

You can reasonably assume that as long as the US economy is growing,  and we are not losing a war, eventually over enough time the S+P will grow at some rate approximating the growth of the economy times the share of corp earnings in the economy, plus the change in P/E ratios, plus some factor of the inflation rate. 

ARKK is not like that. Its holdings don't have the income to support their valuations. Their P/Es are unstable if they even have earnings. Essentially she has filled a very big stadium with a lot of investors, and there are very small doors. Maybe she can pack in some more investors, and you can ride it up, but it is also possible someone yells fire. It doesn't have to come back. These companies are not the backbone of our economy like S+P500 firms

915,gz8a3kc,2021-05-24,t1_gz76ifd,investing,"Huge capacitor banks are used on the grid for reasons other than storage. In an AC system you have reactance which can go in either direction: IIRC, inductive reactance makes the current lag behind the voltage and capacitive reactance pushes it forward. When these are offset across the phases it has the same net effect as resistance in the grid itself which can significantly lower overall efficiency. Anything with a coil such as electric motors or the ballasts in fluorescent lights causes inductive reactance. I'm not sure what causes capacitive reactance these days, but old CRT TVs and monitors used to do it. The two types of reactance cancel each other out though, and certain times of day put different reactance loads on the grid. Factory motors starting up at 7am vs office monitors starting up at 9am. So, massive capacitor banks are used to balance out inductive reactance. Sorry if the explanation is a bit rusty, I have not worked in that field since the 80's.",[],0

But I do have to figure out what is worth buying vs a joke. I still have a lot to learn for long term bets.

I still haven't figured out where the coin values come from exactly or how blockchain really works, but  if what I've seen so far about some of these producing cheaper alternatives than current system applications, thus creating internet 3.0, then these crypto currencies should take off in my opinion if they do what they claim.",[],0

Bitcoin is the only digital gold. The other‚Äôs are known as ‚Äúshitcoins‚Äù because they are copycats for grifters and gamblers. There are some real utility tokens in the mix though, but their purpose is not to be a digital gold reserve currency.

Gold has the test of time on its side for sure! Ask yourself, why has gold been the money of choice for so long? Because it is scarce, divisible, and portable. Bitcoin is more scarce, more divisible, and more portable. Another plus is for the first time in history, money can‚Äôt be counterfeited.

Gold‚Äôs use in jewelry and industry is nice, but it is not the reason it is usable as money, and it‚Äôs not the reason gold has a $10T market cap.
