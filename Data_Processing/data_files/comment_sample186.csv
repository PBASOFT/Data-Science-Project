Dividends are nice because they give you a shot of cash to play with which encourages you to do more research (learn) and buy more stuff. Never use DRIPs when young (or ever if you plan to be active). Learn to do things yourself. Again, the goal between 18-30ish is to learn. For every slumdog there are 9 others who have to start over at 30. Stick to BKLC and VTI.

As you get older and wiser, thats when you should start taking more sophisticated positions. 30s is probably the right time (giver or take) because, odds are, you have faced at least one bear market and one inflated sector pump and dump by then and learned from it.

196,gzfd2kh,2021-05-25,t1_gzelxxn,stocks,"In relation to the operations of the company itself? 

The company is in the process of swiftly overhauling its entire business strategy with Ryan Cohen, founder of Chewy at the helm. And there's optimism and an element of hype behind the process in a nutshell. 

Given the success of Chewy, with its focus on excellent customer service, achieving customer loyalty, planning and setting up of its fulfillment centers and logistics network for delivering its products, the idea is that Ryan Cohen is someone who has credible experience and understanding of constructing successful ecommerce businesses. 

An ecommerce business that could still exist and compete, despite juggernauts like Amazon already existing and having a sizeable foothold in the sector. 

In August 2020, it's revealed he purchased a ~13% stake of the company, which suddenly makes him a major shareholder. 

Being an activist investor, this caused rumblings about whether he was going to step in and play a more ""active"" role in shaping the future of the company. Otherwise, what did he see in this supposedly dying company that he would go in and buy a huge chunk of it? 

A couple of months go by without a lot of noise, when all of a sudden, a filing through the SEC reveals that Cohen (through his investment firm) officially sent the company's board an aggressive letter basically saying how much the video game market has grown over the past decade, how the company has failed to capitalize on it and obtain market share, and refuses to change its antiquated ways at the expense of the shareholders. 

It turns out he tried reaching out to board members several times beforehand to discuss needing to change things up, and all attempts fell on deaf ears and were given cold shoulders. This just emboldened him, ""well if you guys aren't gonna take this seriously, then I'll just take it to the next level.""

January 2021, it's announced Cohen officially gains board seats, not only for himself, but also for two former Chewy executives, the CFO (Jim Grube) and CMO (Alan Attal). He's effectively consolidating power over the company in order to steer it the way he wants. 

March, news surfaces that the company's CFO and CCO (Chief Customer Officer) are resigning in a sign of upper management/C-suite shakeup. Hires of former high-level employees of Amazon, Walmart, and Chewy are announced, to swiftly begin the reconstruction of the business.

April, CEO George Sherman looks to be given the boot as it's announced he's also resigning and the company announces that it's in the process of searching for a successor that will be fit to execute the company's new vision. The board announces Ryan Cohen is the planned new chairman of the board after the voting from the annual shareholder meeting in June takes place.

This guy has essentially gained massive power over the company in a relatively short period of time, and is supposedly hellbent on transforming it into a highly profitable business.",[],0
197,gzfd4q2,2021-05-25,t1_gzfd2kh,stocks,"One of the biggest concerns for many years was GameStop's high level of debt. And, this was also one of the reasons for the shorters' high conviction over the doom of the company. 

Well ... in the beginning of May, the company announced it took advantage of the elevated price of GME, issued ~3.5 million shares to the market, and raised roughly half a billion dollars. 

And ... supposedly with this new war chest, paid off essentially all of its outstanding debt. The debt that shorters thought had the company cornered and set to crumble.

Now, the question is, is the current price of GME somewhat reasonable or completely whacko. 
I am of the opinion that it may be high, but it's really not that insane given all the supposedly positive things happening within the company that point to massive change and its valuation relative to market conditions. 

At its current range, it moves between 10B-20B, which I can understand people wanting to say it's high af. 

However, look at our current market environment. We have a ton of companies doing less than 500M, 300M, 200M in revenue a quarter ... some barely profitable, many aren't profitable at all ... being valued at 20B, 30B, 50B ... 90B+ ... DDOG, CRWD, NET, DKNG, DASH ... SHOP is at 153B valuation off <1B quarterly revenue. 

Yet, somehow GME with 2B+ revenue last quarter at something like 15B valuation is completely bonkers and deserves more criticism and spotlight compared to all these other, imo, more bonkers companies.

Even Chewy itself has revenue/earnings comparable to GameStop, yet was valued at nearly 50B just 3 months back.

The thing that GameStop doesn't have compared to many of these other companies is actual revenue growth.
Its revenue figures completely stagnated for many years, and began dropping the past couple.

I'm not saying these are bad companies or anything. And comparing GameStop to these other companies isn't exactly apples to apples. I just don't understand when people call GameStop insanely overvalued, but conveniently fail to associate all these other instances of even more outlandish valuations. 

If the company can reestablish growth, its valuation is gonna go way past what it is now judging by how the stocks of all these other companies have performed.

Now, as for the whole ""squeeze"" and the superstonk community, yeah, there's a lot of nuttiness and straight-up conspiracy theory there. I've lost track of the number of times the community believed something was gonna happen on some date, and nothing of significance ends up happening unsurprisingly. 

However, I also don't believe that there's absolutely nothing fishy going on with the short situation. 

Some of the accusations on naked shorting, hiding shorts, DTCC being irresponsible, SEC not doing their job do have merit to an extent. However, I believe a lot of the theories there put it all on steroids, and the actual truth is somewhere in the middle. 

The '$10 Million is the Floor' is completely loco.
However, I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a further squeeze either. 
It would be a couple thousand at best imo.

There just isn't a whole lot of transparency. 
And there are tactics to hide the size of positions from public knowledge.
So, the amount of actual exposure currently at stake against GME isn't clear.",['GME'],0

Your arbitrary time period doesn’t mean anything. Expand that time period to a year and they have massive growth. Nothing about that predicts the future. You can choose any combination of time periods to fit whatever scenario you are looking for.

>so they only have to return to where they already were

Says what? Says who? Why do *you* know this and everyone else doesn’t? Where’s your proof? 

>Wall street spent months talking about moving out of growth and going to cyclicals

No. The talking heads talked about their analysis of money flow.

The money flow is entirely obvious. Pandemic destroyed cyclicals, so money flows out of that into tech/medical. Pandemic eases, money slowly flows back into cyclical. But we also see money flowing into commodities. So now we get to predict where money flows back into. Or does it just settle to pre-covid. Most analysts see the money flowing to the most reasonable forward earnings; that is not tech. 

Just because a once in a century event inflated the price of a stock, doesn’t mean that price is representative of the company’s outlook. The price movements in 2020 were not organic. 

>so eventually they’ll go back

Again, where’s your proof? Why do you know what they are going to do with their money when they don’t even know yet?

Wall Street did move out of growth we saw it happen with the prices as well as reports like: Cathie selling, Chamath selling, Branson selling, a lot of SPACs are down and out. Growth went down and ppl back out, that’s not the talking heads.

I’m not saying anything will happen with mathematical certainty. However, I think it’s very very very unlikely that Wall Street will never return to growth positions. It inherently part of how the market values everything. So it makes sense that after they come out of cyclicals they will return to growth. Maybe they’ll go to financials first, who knows.

These communities are basically support groups for people who make sketchy investments, just like a cult or people falling for a scam.

And yes, I've read the GME ""DD"". I understand the short squeeze aspect. But nothing in there suggests that the price of GME will actually hit astronomical levels, in the tens of thousands or even millions. The people who believe that are idiots and just don't understand law.

Yes, you can say ""hedge funds are required to cover shorts"". But where does the money come from? That's like saying that homeowners are ""required to pay their mortgage"". Yes, they do. But sometimes they don't. And they get foreclosed on. You can't take money from someone who is out of money.

There's no situation where a hedge fund will be paying $10k/share for GME to cover a short position. They will go bankrupt before that happens.

People who make comments saying that they're poor and they hold one share hoping that it goes to $10M so they can escape poverty are gullible idiots with no financial knowledge and it's sad that the GME groups are taking advantage of people like that, propping them up, and offering them moral support instead of kicking them in the ass and telling them to get a fucking grip on reality.

I personally know people who love Peloton and would probably buy anything if it had Peloton branding. That is eerily similar to Apple. I remember when Apple was consistently making inferior products compared to Samsung and yet they sold out because of their loyal customers. 

On top of that, they also sell clothing. Owning Peloton product is a statement just like owning Apple product as a statement. One of the biggest reasons why Peloton hasn't been profitable is because of the massive amount of money they have put into marketing and development. They spend roughly 40-60% of their yearly revenue on marketing per year. They truly are positioning themselves to become the top of the line industry-standard company. If you're deciding to buy or sell Peloton stock based on the performance of yesterday and today, you are buying and selling the stock with the wrong intention. This is a long term hold, in my opinion this is the fitness version of getting into AAPL in the early generations of the iPhone. Peloton is a huge disruption in their industry when you take into account the full company and not just the production side of it. Like someone else said, other companies sell future yard-sale equipment. Peloton sells an experience, and if a person buys the bike and subscribes to their business model, it'll take 4 years to make the same gross revenue from their subscription as they did with the bike. I get that 4 years is a lot of time, but other companies aren't adding that kind of value to their product. Other companies bucks stop once the customer has purchased the equipment",['AAPL'],0

As for your other advice:

You posted about the market getting too hot in Feb 2021 and indicated you were bearish. Since then Dow and S&P are up 7-8%.

You posted a short term price target for CGC of $100 a few months ago which would have been a 150% return on current price. CGC has since fallen 40% to $24.

Your price target of SPCE indicates a 150% annual return in a mere two years. Pretty easy to tell that one will fall flat.

Now of course the entire market is just based on investor sentiment and literally anything can happen, but I think the point the person wanted to make was that there is no reason to be hyped or similar for this. 

Take earnings for example, if they are insanely good you can be hyped about it, or really good news in general. That still doesn't mean that it has to go up or anything has to change, but a positive move should be most likely (of course, depending on many factors. E.g. if it beat expectations but investors had even higher expectations and the earnings were shortcoming of that, then it will fall regardless).

When it was first announced to be discussed someone got quite upset in the thread and noted that the value of the stock isn't changed by this move. I was surprised by his anger because the comment he replied to didn't indicate that, but for some reason (and I have seen that plenty after that post) it's almost treated as if you just get free shares or other benefits by many people.

Are you trying to make a quick buck, in it for the short term, or long term investor?  

**RKT** came into focus a few months ago when it came out that it was being targeted by short-sellers ($24/sh).  The CEO took the strong arm position that he was going to go against them and the stock responded positively (due to GME being in the news then).  This was prior to earnings, and even CNBC commented on it compliments of Cramer IIRC ($28/sh)

A few days later it went back down to it's prior price point ($25/sh), and though earnings were positive, it continued to decline.  Now $16/sh.

It's basically under attack and as many saavy investors recognize, short-sellers are betting against the company for a reason.

In that business, you make money from the interest (as a lender, compliments of amortization), origination and other fees as a service provider.  

Interest rates declining incentivize people to refinance a mortgage, or to move to a new home (property tax caps be forgotten).  This means greater profits when rates are decreasing.  

Interest rates have no more room to go down, and people are going to hold on to their mortgage rates (0.5% to 0.75% difference) meaning amortization plays a role in favor of the borrower.  

Millennials have been adverse to buying homes, preferring to rent.  Builders in large cities have accommodated this trend as well.  Evictions have held off and affordable housing coming into a larger role the last few years.

Long term investors like Mr. Buffett have exited the financials market (e.g. WFB) which include lenders.  Back to that original question, what kind of investor are you?

I remember WAMU and Countrywide.  Today it's dominated by Quicken and a dozen years back it was another lender (forgot the name) and it'll be different a dozen years from now.

Anyhow, I'd avoid the entire mortgage / lender sector:

* Refinancing decreases when rates are low, or increasing
* COVID has impacted income for many people
* Evictions on hold, but now that they can be relaxed, expect people to exhibit poor credit
* Preference for renting in city-centers versus buying in the 'burbs.

How are they valued today, and how will that valuation look like in 1 yr, 3 yr or 5 yrs + if they grow their revenues by an amount I see as reasonable. 

Do they have any sort of advantage over the competition and is that advantage growing/shrinking? Will they be able to maintain the advantage for the foreseeable future? 

Maybe consider looking up the google trends to see how their popularity/searches fluctuate. Has the company and their main product been on a strong decline in the last 10 years in terms of popularity/online searches, why?

760,gzfxgbb,2021-05-25,t1_gzfvdy3,stocks,"In the short term, yes. If there's a correction to historical norms, none of that will matter. Investing in physical silver isn't a standard play on returns like most people are familiar with. It's a hedge against USD, as well as a prediction of a correction to standard ratios. 

If silver corrects to its mid 1900s ratio of 1:45 gold:silver, that's a 50% return, on top of any incremental growth from both metals. I'm fine with 15% above spot for that (which is atypical and only a result of unprecedented demand of this past year). If it corrects to its historical value against the USD, that's a significant jump in price.

Most PM ""experts"" would put realistic fair value of silver above $100. That's again assuming accurate pricing to its previous value against the dollar. A few make the case for $1000. I think that's a stretch, and more in line with the pre 1900s pegged value of 1:15 gold:silver. But even at $130, does it really matter if you paid $32 for an ounce when spot was $28? Especially if anything were to happen to devalue the dollar even more than it already is. Both the Euro and the Renminbi are gaining traction as a global reserve currency.

But really, I'm not in silver because I think it's going to be some outperforming asset. It's a hedge against hyperinflation. At 3-5% of a portfolio, I'm fine with the current prices. And it's value against gold leaves it undervalued even with premiums factored in.",[],0

Myself I saw a bunch of WSB posts hitting the frontpage a couple of times and I had looked into getting something like Robinhood but I'm not from the US so my efforts kind of stranded there. Then when the GameStop squeeze (or baby squeeze of whatever) happened, I said to myself: I missed out on the (post keeps getting deleted for saying pitloin) crazes, missed out on this one - I'm gonna make sure I don't miss out on the next ridiculous moneyride. So here I am, entering the market in February, doing all the DD, looking left right up down into all kinds of stocks that I still believe in and investing in a bunch. I entered with around 4k. I lost about a quarter of that. All the while I've had 2 shares of GME or something and it's hard to miss out on the DD for that.

So after a while I kept dumping more of my other stocks and trading them in for GME and AMC. I have those + some uwmc. I'm in the green again! And like you said, it's a hell of a ride, very entertaining. And personally I don't think it's that stressful. I kind of accepted that this money went to a unique experience and a possible winning lottery ticket. So whatever it's doing, it's fine by me.

Economics, for the most part, only covers anticompetitive component of antitrust. Large firms like Amazon are demonstrating that when I firm is significantly large they can impact things like local and state tax structures and incentives. They are automatically given a seat at the table when it comes to larger political decisions. Instead of “we the people” it’s “Amazon. And the other people”.

Tesla has been unable to keep their lead in both technology, car quality or marketshare.

Next day they blocked buying.  When they lifted it I DCA on the way down.  Finally got out of robinhood and tranfered my shares to Fidelity.  Saw others did the same with robinhood falsifying purchase prices messing with peoples cost basis.  Luckily didn't happen to me they got it right.  After saving for a while put $3k in and spent half on AMC at $9.80.  Immediately dipped down to $8.  Never sold any shares GME or AMC.  Now I am way up.  Wanted to buy in again on GME at $150 but by the time I got the funds I wanted it was at $155.  Got greedy and said I would wait for drop to buy in.  It never dropped.

It’s been amazing to have during COVID obviously, but I’ll explain why I bought before lockdown.

•	In the winter where I live, it’s dark and probably raining (Seattle) by 5 PM so I’m not going to be working out outside for half the year, at least.
•	Going to a gym involves bringing clothes and gear to work with me and then adding at least some extra commute time to get to the gym before or after work, which I don’t need more of.  Said another way, if I want to get a half hour workout in at a gym then it will require a lot more time than a half hour to actually make it happen.  I’m busy and would rather wake up, bang out 30-45 minutes on the bike, and continue getting ready for work.
•	My company and many others in the area offer fitness subsidies to employees.  I get a $500 fitness subsidy per year but have to spend $1,000 for them to reimburse the $500.  With Peloton’s zero down, zero interest payment plan I can spread the cost over multiple years and my company will end up having paid for a significant portion of the bike.  Hard to spend $1,000 per year on fitness otherwise, unless you want to pay for classes that require commuting to.
•	I get a way better workout with an instructor than I would if I was just spinning on a stationary bike.

I’m sure my reasons don’t apply for everyone’s situations, but I will absolutely be using my Peloton for a long time.  All that said, the stock is overvalued lol",[],0
