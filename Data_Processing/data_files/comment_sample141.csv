The company refuses to publish audited financials, Pawson has a past littered with suits and fraud. The WeShield acquisition cannot be verified without further information from OPTI. WeShield corporate address is an apartment in NY. I get working from home, but ‚Äúa company with 50 million‚Äù in audited revenue almost never operate out of an apartment . Possible but unlikely. Their phone number also doesn‚Äôt even have a corporate voicemail. Again, what 50 million dollar company doesn‚Äôt have a VM. Pawson recently applied to increase the authorized shares by 1billion and would see his share increase as well. The increase in AS can be found on Wyoming chamber of commerce website where OPTI is incorporated. 
I know OPTI says they have a 2 billion dollar contract, that is part of a larger 200 billion dollar deal but again has failed to disclose which company this is with. It should also be noted that basically NO private company can order a 200 billion dollar contract. It has to be government money.

OR

If your broker was shitty then they sold your ""extra"" shares and it went into your available funds. What's even worse is that if they did cash you out, they pocketed the extra money themselves from High Tide rounding everyone up that YOU were supposed to get.

Example: Let's say I had 23 shares worth $1 each (for ease of explanation purposes, I know that wasn't the price). Your shares were SUPPOSED to round up to 30 shares because you met the half way mark ( 23/15 = 1.5333) but instead, your shitty brokerage sold those 8 ""extra shares"" for you, gave you one share for your 15 from the reverse split, and then THEY POCKETED THE OTHER 7 SHARES FROM THE ROUNDING UP THEMSELVES.

528,gyrir31,2021-05-20,t3_ngfnfd,pennystocks,"I'll preface this by saying orders are of course on a millisecond level, and even if two orders hit the exchanges front facing infrastructure at the exact same time, latency could be added as an order is processed through systems to cause a distinction.

Their are different algorithms used for prioritising and processing orders, but on a technical level, I think its important to understand that due the vast amount of orders flowing in (and to provide scalability), orders will often be placed in a message/service broker based system, were they can be ""queued"" before a worker process can take the task off the queue and perform the desired actions. These queues are linear and not parallel usually (acting as funnel) so the message broker system would place two order coming in at the same time as a random order for simple fulfilment. It will then be down to the algorithm implemented by workers.

The two algorithms are FIFO (First In, First Out) or Pro-rata algorithm.   
In FIFO, orders are processed entirely on the back end time stamp for processing, so if two orders where to come in (regardless of their size), the first item to be added in to the queue (Randomly remember) will be processed first.

Pro-rata on the other hand uses order size as another variable to decide how to process an order. So in the event two orders come in at the same size, the largest order size is used. This method is more commonly implemented as in a order matching process (Between buyers or sellers), this process is much more scalable and applicable to varying order flows.",[],1

Most smaller-scale brokers already didn't allow such stocks, most international brokers were limiting them more and more by the day, and one of the biggest brokers in the world Fidelity was already not allowing users to purchase such stocks.

You have a bit more freedom on Schwab and TDA although Schwab has some limits and both were soon not going to be allowing CE stocks.

In the end this is going to both help and hurt retail investors.

1. Protects idiots from themselves as they won't be able to buy into as many scams due to limiting how risky or speculative a stock they can invest in.

2. Prevents many retail traders from getting into companies so early, meaning they will potentially get screwed over by institutional or larger investors who can and then sell into the retail when a company finally does go pink current.

Likewise, it's probably going to both hurt and help the OTC market.

1. Forces companies to get their shit together if they want enough retail investment to grow meaning the cream will rise to the top theoretically and better quality companies will be more noticeable.

2. Limits the potential for one of the big reasons many play the OTC markets in the first place... finding hidden gems early.",[],0

On September 28, 2021, new requirements take effect that will impact the market for‚Äîand value of‚Äîcertain ‚Äúover-the-counter (OTC) securities‚Äù you currently hold or have held in the past. The new rules apply to ‚ÄúPink No Information‚Äù OTC securities of companies that fail to publicly report and keep current financial and other company information and will restrict the ability of U.S. brokers, like E\*TRADE from making these products generally available.  
  
Some background on the new requirements  
  
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently adopted amendments to SEC Rule 15c2-11 governing the submission and publication of OTC quotations. These amendments will prohibit broker-dealers from submitting or publicly disseminating bid/ask quotations for OTC securities of issuers that do not meet enhanced information filing requirements.  
  
Securities of issuers that make the required information publicly available by the deadline in the rule should not be affected.  
  
What these changes mean for you  
  
Starting September 28, 2021, you will no longer be able to buy or sell ‚ÄúPink No Information‚Äù OTC securities through E\*TRADE. Other restrictions related to the purchase of these securities may apply sooner. Please keep in mind that the upcoming changes will negatively affect the value of any ‚ÄúPink No Information‚Äù OTC securities you hold now or in the future.  
  
Here‚Äôs how to get more information about these changes and how they might affect you:  
	  
	Understand the SEC amendments for OTC securities  
	Learn more about quotations for OTC securities

799,gysybee,2021-05-20,t3_ngqajk,pennystocks,"I guess it depends on how the tweets are presented. I don't blame someone for buying before tweeting - especially someone with a large following. To do otherwise would be dumb and make me wonder why they're not prioritizing their trades over their tweets. So that being said, if someone with thousands of followers tweets that they are accumulating, it comes off as disingenuous.

I imagine a lot of these guys are good momentum traders, and that's how they get the followers in the first place. Maybe it's an double edged sword, where they'd be foolish not to adapt once they see a pattern developing of price bumps after their posts. What grinds my gears is when they post really dumb DD. Part of it is DD simply isn't a big factor of their strategy, but I can't help but feel they're often playing dumb and they know whatever catalyst they're pumping is BS. If they never respond to feedback pointing out some of the less glowing aspects of a catalyst, that's a red flag they're being disingenuous.

All said, my favorite Twitter posters are focused more on general advice and information, not calling out entries.

These are very small studies (n value is low).  It is early in the game for these drugs, alot of things could go wrong.  I'm sure there will be side effects if they do a trial with more people.  Also I wonder how difficult it is to prepare these drugs (I work in the pharmacy and this can make or break some of these drugs).  The TK drug wasn't doing to well in the data until cohort 9. I wonder what they changed ?  I've seen drugs ike Lartruvo get fast tracked with Orphan status then fail in the macro data when the number of patients is higher (it was taken off the market).  ROR sounds like a good new target to try, but I've seen other targets like hedgehog fail when you use more patients.

Beyond that, I believe all brokers are going to stop selling OTC stocks that don't get current by the September deadline. That will include many more OTC's than just the CE ones.
