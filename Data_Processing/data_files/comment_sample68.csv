107,gz2hzra,2021-05-22,t1_gz1y7k9,stocks,"You have to learn that yourself, for programming I will most certainly not give you a full tutorial.

For Excel, use the googlefinance functions which allows you to get the price of the opening and closing price of today, or the opening price and current price of today (depending on if you want to make it after market closes, you can also use closing price of the last day to include after hours and pre market changes).

Now you need to determine what company belongs to which sector, I assume this is manually done, but there could also be a google finance command. None that I know though. This is used for grouping them together.

Once this is done you have to add the total of the sector to get the percentages of for each company within it's sector. If e.g. Amazon is 10% of it's entire sector, then your goal is that the volume of the box is equal to 10% of the entire sector it belongs to. By setting a standard size for the entire sector box you can determine what volume is needed for the Amazon box (in length and width) while attempting to keep length and width the same size (at least to gain boxes, though it looks like this is flexible here to make fit for everything. Point is it's supposed to be accurate and similar for most, at least).

Now comes the more complicated part of what belongs to what. This might be possible via some sort of graph I am not familiar with, but if I had to do this I would do it via a VBA macro. Since I calculated the length and width I can use a sheet where I use the cells as squares, meaning same length and width. Each square is supposed to represent a certain measuring size, like 0.1cm x 0.1cm. This would also represent 1% market cap. Note that this is super simplified and the actual sheet might require thousands, if not more, single 0.01cm x 0.01cm to give an accurate picture.

Back to the macro, you take the length and width and fill out these areas. There is a ton of fine tuning that can be done here, e.g. pre-calculating where the top 10 have to be to make a fitting image (if you have a total of 10cm x 10cm and 2 companies combined have a length of 6cm and 3cm, then this will look weird as 1cm is left unused). I assume here scaling would be effective, or simply morphing values to make them fit. Morphing can't be done to all values, so it would be off by a slight amount. In above example of 6 and 3 cm that would be 66% of the 1cm for the 6 size one (6/9=0.66=66%) and 0.33 cm for the 3cm to keep the same ratio. Scaling is technically the same, except it would be on all sides equally.

Lastly the macro only has to take in the original calculation you did (current price/opening price or whatever you are looking for) to calculate the difference. Depending on the value you can choose a range of colors to use. VBA allows you to use RGB colors, meaning you can simply use a basic number, multiply it by the outcome of the division and based on that color the cells. That will lead to darker red if its deep negative and darker green if deep positive. Now you just take the hight of the cells you just colored and add a title to it, I would probably just use the top row of it, type in the ticker name (here: AMZN), add the profit or loss behind it, then combine all the cells that belong to it's width and finally select all cells I colored and put a frame around them. This can easily be done since you calculated in the beginning what cells are supposed to be colored, so you have the measurement readily available. For something like the title you just take less cells. You can even set a font size depending on the amount of width and length to make it fitting, so a 50x50 cell would have a larger font than a 10x10 would have.",[],1

114,gz2ilza,2021-05-22,t1_gz193zh,stocks,"I'll say this, I understand the bear case with DraftKings and I think you present a good case, but it's just not how I would evaluate it. You're really basing their entire valuation on one segment of revenue then. In-venue betting has the potential to be far more lucrative then traditional physical sportsbooks in places like casinos. They will get a lot more casual foot traffic than traditional books that typically only get people that are specifically going to the casino to place a sports bet. Will the overhead costs be higher than online? Absolutely, but I'm not fully convinced the margins will be that much worse. If they are, these places can always scale back to just kiosks and still get the increased traffic.

Honestly, I think $9.5B is still far too low even just for online betting as well. Newly expanded states generate roughly 80% of their revenue from online/mobile betting. For my previous estimate that puts it in the range of $8.4-$16B in the future once full roll out. With the exposure to people who don't use illegal sites, the end number should be higher than that range. That also doesn't take into account the growth this industry is still seeing YoY. 

I will admit though, there are certainly bear cases to sports betting as a whole. One of which is they have to convert all of the people using illegal sites. That'll be more difficult for people who are comfortable on the platform they are already using and/or want it to be easier to dodge taxes. I could see state crackdowns on illegal sites in the future since it will impact the revenue they'll generate. Another is I think people assume widespread legalization is going to be easier. We are mostly left with the states that have more complex issues and rollout from here could be slower in the remaining states. I do eventually expect widespread physical and mobile betting throughout the US, but I think it could take longer than most people anticipate.

There are risks associated investing in DraftKings. But I still think the potential of this market is immense and DraftKings has a good opportunity to expand to other areas as well.",[],1

Locking desperate developing nations in to economic servitude with predatory lending via the belt and road initiative (much of Africa, Bangladesh).

Outright hostage taking of foreign nationals (Canadians Michael Spavor and Michae Korvig of Canada, held since 2018 without council in windowless rooms with the lights on 24 hours a day).

- an ETF is also a collection of stocks or other assets. the main differences are (1) ETFs trade in the middle of the day like stocks, so the price can fluctuate mid-day, but mutual funds trade only on one price at the end of the day and (2) ETFs will have an additional fee called the ""bid/ask spread"" -- bid is the buyer price, ask is the seller price. there's always a gap even if it's just a penny (but it can be much larger_, and you pay this fee to whoever handles the trade each time you buy/sell. IMO the only major advantage to ETFs is in a taxable account, because they're structured to minimize capital gains taxes. in a tax-sheltered retirement account, capital gains doesn't matter. 

- an index fund is one strategy for mutual fund or ETF investing -- an index tracks a sector of the market and doesn't do detailed stock-by-stock or company-by-company analysis. for example the Russell 1000 is just a list of the largest 1000 companies that trade on the US stock markets. every 4 months, they adjust the list as companies get bigger or smaller. the type of company, or if the company is profitable or not doesn't factor into the list. in contrast there are growth stock funds (companies growing faster than average for their type), or value investing (companies where the stock is on sale relative to the value of the company, like buying a $10,000 car for $5,000). there are sector funds (healthcare stocks, energy stocks), or other strategies. indexing will have lower management fees, and over time it's difficult to beat the averages of the overall market. so there's a wide agreement that most of your investing should be in low-fee funds.",[],1

378,gz2xl26,2021-05-22,t3_niiukt,stocks,"The discount is not deep enough for me yet to start investing. The CCP and Jack Ma have stated that companies exist to serve the country, the party, and its people. Where does that leave its shareholders? Along the same theme, BABA has not been spending, acquiring companies wisely probably because it is more interested in growing China's GDP via inefficient market activity (digging holes and than filling them) rather making the most financially sound decision for its shareholder. At this discount, any Western companies interested in serving its shareholders would have announced a massive bb program already. The fact that BABA has not tell me that it and the CCP view the company as an extension of the State apparatus, private in name only and can be repurposed if and when the party wants anytime. This is something that westerners have a difficult time comprehending: companies in Asian societies exist to serve the countries and its people. Private property is respected only to the extent that it immediately benefit society. When push comes to shove, respect for private property goes out the window.  

Hence, my personal catalyst is when BABA announce how it plan to reward its shareholders in the form of bb or dividend.

If China kills Alibaba for whatever reason you think (I wonder how they are bigger then the state, when their state stopped a spin-off, for instance), they'll make themselves uninvestable, and I don't see why they would go for such a thing.

just FYI you don't need tons of high tech gizmos to be a good investor. the hedge fund manager Seth Klarman, a widely respected value investor, doesn't use a Bloomberg Terminal at his desk. he's a long-term investor, mostly uninterested in by-the-minute data. Will Danoff at Fidelity manages of one of their flagship funds (FCNTX) and he's also old-school, wth tons of handwritten notes and in-person phone-calls to companies he buys. 

Howard Marks, in his book The Most Important Thing, explains how technical analysis/chart reading is nowhere near as important as it used to be. the data simply isn't there so show it's useful in the long-term. 

>I want them to have exposure to everything from currency arbitrage and commodity futures to stocks/bonds plus learning all forms of trading like leverage and shorting, etc.

from what I've read, not all successful, legendary professional investors make heavy use of strategies like that. for every Soros (shorting the UK pound) or Sir John Templeton (shorting dot-com bubble stocks), we could also list examples like Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, Joel Tillinghast, Christopher Browne, and many others who simply focus on buying good companies at reasonable prices.

Alibaba is already extremely profitable, hard to increase the percent of revenue that goes to profit. But Alibaba is at a forward P/E around 20 I think, so they don’t need to be more profitable to be a extremely good stock. They are growing extremely much so if they just maintain there profit margin, their P/E is what it should be years ahead, so if they grow revenues like 25% per year their stock should grow similar IMO.",[],1

However in China the government is above all and anything that might threaten that control is targeted and eliminated with brutal efficiency. BABA was the nail that stuck out and got hammered down.

The government will never allow BABA to amass as much power in China as a company like Amazon has in the West. So where does that leave their future? I don't think anyone knows. But this could very well hang over their heads forever. They should recover somewhat but could very well stagnate for years with their growth potential severely limited.

Full disclosure, I initially lost money on meme stocks and then I turned around and earned on them. I am currently earning on them and I have been/am using money that I am fully okay with losing/not having access to. I have long term investments that I'm doing just fine with.

Firstly: do you believe that retail investors and institutions are treated 100% equally? Do we all participating in the SM follow the same rules and are all punishments for not doing so applied equally? Yes or no and why or why not?

Second: do you believe that someone with 100$ in the market vs someone with 100,000,000$ has the same earning potential on any given stock? Yes or no and why or why not?

> Do your research on what you're buying
Third: have you done any research into [currently most popular meme stock]? If so, could you provide some examples of the most compelling data that you found to influence your position one way or another?

I only question you due to the nature of your post. It could just be because it's all in text, but the overall tone of your post is from an elevated position talking down.

The helicopter blades could spin faster to overcome this, or you could use propulsion (as in a jet engine). Right now kerosene jet fuel is about 15 times more energy dense than liIon batteries, and so you would need an incredibly substantial jump in energy density of batteries to overcome this.

Now, the first thing to learn is that investing is typically pretty boring. A market like we’ve had the past year only comes along a few times in your life. Other years boring/safe investments will be the play.

I agree with others about reading The Intelligent Investor. It’s a good book that explains a lot of the most basic things about analyzing a company. Although the kind of deep value plays that Graham talks about really aren’t there anymore. The market finds everything these days. 

If you have a lot of time to pay attention and read up on individual companies, go ahead and do that. But please don’t think that day-to-day or month-to-month moves are all that important. If you’re holding something you believe in, you should be able to hold it for years. Go look at a chart of basically any company in the S&P 500 and what they’ve done for 1 month, 6 months, and a year. You’ll see ups and downs. Then zoom the chart out to 10 years or 15 years and it will look like a straight line up and to the right. Even the 2008-2009 crash will look like a tiny blip.

I’d also recommend reading about diversification, since your portfolio really doesn’t have any. Some companies like Rio Tinto, Auto-Zone, AppHarvest, ect. I’m merely using these companies as examples of other industries/growth that you can invest in. 


With so many large cap stocks, you’ve basically bought an index with how your portfolio will move. I personally never buy a company until I know a bit about them, and even then it’s only a small position. As I learn more and my confidence in the companies growth grows, I add more to a position until I’m comfortable. 

Don’t buy motley fool. Check out investopedia for some quick online reading.",[],1

Methane deteriorates in the atmosphere in approximately 9 years whereas CO2 typically stays there for thousands of years. The quick takeaway is that methane emissions are only a concern in terms of near term warming - which is arguably more important - but longer term it all comes back to CO2.

Natural gas is by far the leading driver of why the U.S. has been able to significantly cut its emissions without any real climate policy.
