1,2021-05-15,nczqjr,pennystocks,"Thai Airways is might be undergoing a debt rehab program. The government said today that they won't be supporting the airline financially. They then said that after they go through the rehab program they would see what they could do. It seems like the government wants to stay out of it until they know the company can fix their own problems. What does that mean for the stock? I know the airline is booking flights for the summer, but it worries me that the government isn't going to support them at all. Without that financially security I can't see this stock going up, unless this summer really booms for them. With COVID restrictions falling maybe this is a wise investment, but before I put money into it I just wanted to see what others were thinking. Right now it's at .19, could skyrocket if the company gets their finances in order, or if the government does bail them out?

They vote on the debt program next week. If it fails the company goes under if it passes they get to go through the debt program.

Here's the article: https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2116055/pm-denies-b50bn-thai-airways-recap-plan

A quick edit as some have stated this may be misleading. The government is saying they will not HAND them the money to pay their debts back. But they will let them use the debt program if the creditors back them and then look into supporting them financially. Sorry for any confusion.",[],0

The guys that are working on this merger are Paul Moody and Jeffrey DeNunzio: the same guys that brought KAVL and NXMH (both are separate tickers that have completed merging). NXMH went sub penny last fall to $14.50 in late January WITH NO REVERSE SPLIT! KAVL went as high as $3.30 this year and is a profitable company set to make hundreds of millions in revenue for 2021 (their last Q showed $35M+ revenue). Other tickers these guys are involved with that are pending mergers are BSPI (formerly IALS, subpenny last summer to over $0.40 this year since Moody and DeNunzio got involved), CHSO, and FTRK (formerly SENY). 

Look at the charts of any of these plays and you'll see why there's excitement about CPSL (and FTRK, for that matter, that has a much smaller share structure). CPSL has 2.4B OS right now and recently filed a Form 10-12G a couple weeks ago.

Moody and DeNunzio do mergers right. No reverse splits and the companies they bring in are highly valuable and do wonders to the share price. With a merger expected this summer and a custodianship termination hearing on June 1, watch for a steady rise before liftoff in CPSL.

Very low Debt/Equity (they can pay their debt) and excellent Current Ratio. However I can see  an excessively high P/E. 38% of Insiders Owning is always a good sign. If this stock overpasses that 6.00 price it could skyrocket to 22.00 and if it is broken.... deliberate uptrend.

31,2021-05-16,ndjg0j,pennystocks,"PRPO's Conference Call to be held on Thursday, May 20th, 2021

Two ""huge"" announcements occurred in the last few weeks that have caused the price of PRPO to spike and then fall back:

1. Precipio (PRPO) Launches its Rapid COVID-19 Antibody test on Amazon Platform (May 3, 2021).
2. Precipio Launches New HemeScreen Panel for AML, with an unparalleled 4-hour turnaround-time (May 14, 2021).

In this discussion I want to focus only on the first announcement, the one in regards to to the COVID-19 antibody test.

If you visit Precipio's [online store](https://www.precipiodx.com/shop/) , you will notice that the COVID -19 test is the only product not carrying the Precipio Logo. The reason for that is that this product is only distributed by Precipio, and in fact it is actually a product of a private company called [Nirmidas Biotech, Inc.](https://www.nirmidas.com/)

Nirimidas actually received the FDA/EUA approval in January 05, 2021, and if you check their crapy [website](https://www.nirmidas.com/), you will actually see that they list the partnership with Precipio on [January 28, 2021](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/precipio-launches-covid-19-antibody-143000524.html)

So from all of this we can deduct that the spike on May 3, 2021 was only from the Amazon deal.

My fellow apes, let me begin with the fact that I believe in both products and I own a bag of 1000 shares at an average of $4.45 per share.

I am attracted to the fact Nirimidas is a small private company that has raised so far only [$7,000.000](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nirmidas-biotech) and that PRPO has a current market cap of less than $100 million and still trading on Nasdaq.

So here is the thing:

Since the Amazon deal allows only Physicians and other medical facilities to purchase, I hope that the following is simply a misunderstanding of how the system works.:

I have tracked the product on Amazon and here it is:

[https://www.amazon.com/COVID-19-Antibody-Combo-Detection-Kit/dp/B08XG2XVSF/ref=cm\_cr\_arp\_d\_pl\_foot\_top?ie=UTF8](https://www.amazon.com/COVID-19-Antibody-Combo-Detection-Kit/dp/B08XG2XVSF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pl_foot_top?ie=UTF8)

This weeks results:

ESOA	2.1	FALSE

LTMAQ	2.45	TRUE

RNVA	0.0009	FALSE

SIGL	1.025	FALSE

These results are from my own heuristic algorithm. Which essentially filters to make sure that the stocks meet certain criteria. 

First filter is that the revenue is twice the market cap, second is that the average volume from 60-30 days ago is less than the last 2 weeks. Third is price (under 5) and lastly is my movement filter which determines if the stock has had much movement in the past week. I obviously don't want to be catching a stock after the peak of pump and dump. 

I plan to host this on a website in the not so distant future. I in fact have it made and ready to go, just need to deploy it.

I am sure most on [r/pennystocks](https://www.removeddit.com/r/pennystocks) have heard of **Citius Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: CTXR)**. There have been countless submissions promoting the stock here, on other sub-reddits and across other social media platforms as well. This promotion has resulted in a substantial increase in volume trading CTXR's stock, and therefore a substantial increase CTXR's stock price - despite FOUR share offerings to raise cash in the last 12 months. 

On the contrary, **Medexus Pharmaceuticals, Inc (OTC: MEDXF)** has received minimal promotion on social media and suffers from very low trading volume. Having read through dozens of the hundreds of CTXR posts over the past few months, I am astounded by the amount of misinformation posted by the OPs as well as the delusion amongst those in the comment section. It reads like a cult. Confusion regarding the status of clinical trials, people claiming approval is expected on X date, assumptions that hospitals will immediately switch to using CTXRs products etc. There is little acknowledgement of the fact that one, or all of their products could be rejected - leaving the company with no viable products and colossal liabilities. Few times have I read someone acknowledging the risk associated with investing in a pre-revenue pharmaceutical company.

&#x200B;

CTXR has the following product portfolio:

1. Mino-Lok. This isn't out of Phase 3 yet. No NDA submission. No FDA review meeting set. It could be years until a date is set. CTXR hope to file an NDA in 2022. Has no guarantee to be approved. No guarantee to be a commercial success. Generates $0 revenue.
2. Mino-Wrap. This is still in Pre-Clinical Studies. Phase 2 isn't expected to start until Q4 2021. Phase 3 isn't expected to start until Q3 2022. NDA submission isn't expected until Q2 2024. Has no guarantee to be approved. Generates $0 revenue.
3. Halo-Lido. Phase 2b trials aren't expected to begin until Q3 2021. No date is provided for anticipated Phase 3 trials. Generates $0 revenue.

&#x200B;

To summarise - three products. None of which are approved anywhere in the world. None of which have a date set for an FDA review meeting. None of which generate any revenue for the company.

CTXR's latest [quarterly report](https://www.otcmarkets.com/filing/html?id=14949610&amp;guid=f98nUaOswTA2O3h) shows they burned through $13.835m of cash in the six months ended 31st March 2020. This is why they so frequently dilute their shareholders through offerings to raise cash. May 2020, August 2020, January 2021 and February 2021 all saw registered direct, public or private offerings. That's four times in just one year. They now have $103m in cash which the CEO claims will see them through to 2024. That is of course assuming they don't pursue any other new products, or run into any legal issues etc. The CEO stated in May 2021 that he expects R&D costs to increase in 2021 as they continue with their trials.

[DawsonJames covered CTXR and projected their expenses](https://dawsonjames.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CTXR.3.10.21.pdf) in 2021 will be $35,000,00, then $36,661,000 in 2022 and presumably this will increase into 2023 and 2024. This $103m of cash might not last very long.

MEDXF has an extensive [product portfolio](https://www.medexus.com/en_US/canadian-product-portfolio). Many of their products are approved and currently generating revenue. Others are awaiting FDA and Health Canada approval after successful trials. Some of their products are:

1. Rasuvo. Approved. MEDXF have 79% of the US market share. Generates revenue.
2. IXINITY. Approved. MEDXF currently have 4% of the $1billion market share. Generates revenue.

MEDXF CEO has stated numerous times that upon US approval (which is not guaranteed, however is widely anticipated by the company and medical community), it will double MEDXF's existing revenues.  


To summarise - MEDXF have assembled an extensive portfolio of products which already generate substantial revenues for the company. So much so, the company achieved record revenue of **$31.5 million (CAD)** for the [three-month period ended December 31, 2020, versus $16.2 million for the same period last year](https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/financial-report/272917/content). In addition, it has a lineup of further products awaiting approval after finishing successful trials - most notably Treosulfan and Trimcinolone Hexacetonide which are anticipated to generate substantial revenue.

MEDXF submitted their NASDAQ application on January 21 2021 and approval is expected imminently. As part of the uplist process they completed a “bought deal” public offering by way of a short form prospectus in Canada, raising approximately $32.5 million, raising their cash on hand to $45 million.

Despite already having an extensive product portfolio generating substantial revenues growing year on year, MEDXF has a lower market cap than CTXR. MEDXF is, somehow, worth less than half of CTXR.

&#x200B;

||Revenue ($CAD) Nine month period ended December 31 2019|Revenue ($CAD) Nine month period ended December 31 2020|Projected 2012 Revenue ($CAD)|Market Cap ($USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|MEDXF|$48,729,000|$82,660,000|$115,000,000 ([Projected by Stifel GMP](https://www.medexus.com/en_US/investors/stock-data/analyst-coverage))|$112,893,116|
|CTXR|$0|$0|$0|$265,528,936|

This hasn't been an attempt to dissuade anybody from investing in CRXR. Neither is it an attempt to persuade people to invest in MEDXF. I solely wish to highlight how some companies benefit greatly from hype generated online, whilst others suffer through falling under the radar. People flock to invest in hugely speculative companies who, even if everything goes successfully, wont begin generating any revenue for years (CTXR, EEENF), yet ignore companies who are already years, even decades ahead of pre-revenue pharmaceutical companies like CTXR.

I would be interested to hear from people who have invested into CTXR and understand what they hope their investment will do from now until one of their products is (hopefully) approved, commercialised and launched in a few years time.

I do currently hold MEDXF shares and have been increasing my holding for the past three months. I still hold all of my RXMD and continue to average down. I still hold all of my EXPFF.",[],1

50,2021-05-17,ne3y5c,pennystocks,"Key points:

1. Cyios Corporation ($CYIO) just completed acquisition of Australian-based Helio Lending, a leading Ce-Fi cryptocurrency-based loan aggregator. ***Helio Lending is FIRST publicly traded cryptocurrency backed loan provider company in North America!*** See more details in the previous post [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/nc0j3g/cyio_just_merged_with_cryptocurrencybackedlender/).
2. UNIQUE Share Structure situation: $CYIO has one of the best share structures in the OTC market: Only 109M outstanding shares (company confirmed the O/S share number in its last week’s tweet, its the same as posted on OTCM).

&#x200B;

[CYIO \/ Helio Lending tweet regarding unchanged number of 109M shares.](https://preview.redd.it/ou1utdgjynz61.png?width=1478&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5d03b4ae97117b8de8a3920cf3a00e7d0bbc4ee)

Now, out of 109M shares - \~67M shares are owned by Helio lending management/insiders/early investors. That leaves us with only \~42M shares for the public float! As it is - this is already EXTREMELY small float for a penny stock. ***Here is the kicker***: There is a number of longs that accumulated CYIO shares during last \~12months in anticipation of this merger (COVID delayed this transaction in 2020 - but people were buying shares all this time). Well, last week long positions held by longs were polled/counted (most longs are active on twitter etc) and the number came in at just over \~40M shares! (actually close to 42-43M, but im being conservative and im leaving some room for counting error). Which means that the FLOAT IS ALREADY LOCKED BY LONGS! There are very few shares left to buy in the public float, IF ANY!! The stock can rally big time on THIN FLOAT and any news/catalysts/positive developments  ...which leads me to key point #3.

&#x200B;

[CYIO share structure - FLOAT IS LOCKED!](https://preview.redd.it/s59p9djlynz61.png?width=1384&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce9fcfb0ffe955d808bd9752e61c8978f8e85464)

3.  **Major upcoming catalysts** \- the company has recently twitted that it is expecting to announce another acquisition (everything points to crypto space company being the target) and partnerships after the CYIO/Helio merger is completed (*merger already completed on 5/7/21*). Which means this acquisition announcement is coming pretty much any day now! Also, its expecting to release financials next week (which could be another major catalyst if it includes crypto business progress so far). Regarding partnerships - there is due diligence out there pointing to a potential partnership with Propy (twitter @ PropyInc ) - real estate firm with major (Tim Draper) investors and over \~$400M!!! in real estate transactions under its belt. This, combined with multiple additional catalysts - locked float + Helio merger done + partnership + acquisition - can start a huge rally in this stock!  What is the potential price target of such rally? Move on to key point #4.

&#x200B;

[CYIO \/ Helio Lending tweet regarding upcoming acquisition and partnership announcements.](https://preview.redd.it/gn207u3oynz61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=50d4df16d5f8adbcdfa43dc1d871d019a48521f9)

4. Lets talks current stock price  and potential long term target. Let me just say that at the current price of just 0.25cents/share (near 200 daily moving average) and market cap of \~$21M - this company is EXTREMELY undervalued. If we look at the competition market cap and calculate potential price per share off of that then we are looking at absolutely INSANE 21-75$ potential target price range! If realized, we are looking at a potential 8000-30000% rally from current levels!

[Comparison with competition.](https://preview.redd.it/7f3xmd3yynz61.png?width=1116&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6928bbad43f4f79c5d30a28381e2c7d8e704925)

Helio Lending is still undiscovered by the majority of the investors and combined with LOCKED FLOAT situation + upcoming catalysts + booming crypto space we could be looking at the beginning of one major rally from the current levels.

In addition to that, it appears that their [website is currently being updated too](https://www.nohoshot.com/). 

Another catalyst that’s further down the road is that they have been spending time updating their financials going all the way back to 2017. As of the 5th of May all of their financials are up to date and they applied for Pink Current OTC status. From my understanding, once a company applies for Pink Current status, if everything goes well, it can take anywhere from 3-5 weeks to be complete. According from a tweet on the 14th of May when they did apply for SNNC to get Pink Current, it took 5 weeks for the process to complete. 

I think now is a good time get in because the price hasn’t fluctuated too much with the market for the last month and according to OTCShortReport they’ve been shorted from anywhere between 50-70% for the last month which more than likely means that others have been accumulating in the meantime.

The reason for the sudden spike in them stems from two causes

1. **There is a huge chip shortage which is going to impact a lot of areas** \- To quote this article   


>But demand for chips is continuing to outstrip supply, and car makers are no longer the only companies feeling the pinch.  
>  
>Alan Priestley, an analyst at Gartner, told CNBC that the average person on the street is bound to be impacted by the chip shortage in one form or another.  
>  
>“What it will mean is they can’t get something, or prices are slightly higher,” Priestley said during an interview on Thursday.  
>  
>South Korean tech giant Samsung [said last week](https://www.ft.com/content/4b7b284a-a280-4252-bcc7-0fb6a4ef5d92) that the chip shortage is hitting television and appliance production, while LG admitted the shortage is a risk.     
>  
>“Due to the global semiconductor shortage, we are also experiencing some effects especially around certain set products and display production,” said Ben Suh, head of Samsung’s investor relations, on a call with analysts.  


Another quote from the same article 

>  
Production of low-margin processors, such as those used to weigh clothes in a washing machine or toast bread in a smart toaster, has [also been hit](https://www.ft.com/content/9a497f21-e3e4-4c74-8737-07cd13209475). While most retailers are still able to get their hands on these products at the moment, they may face issues in the months ahead.  
>  
>Even dog-washing businesses are suffering, [according to The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/02/chip-semiconductor-shortage-impact/). CCSI, which makes electronic dog-washing booths in the Illinois village of Garden Prairie, was recently told by its circuit board supplier that the usual chips weren’t available, according to the report.  


2. **Governments around the world are beginning to invest more and more funding into semiconductor companies**. For example, [the US is planning to invest  $52Billion into growing semiconductor companies in the US to meet the need](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/semiconductor-industry-funding-plans-in-usa-south-korea) (this was announced on Friday evening). South Korea [recently committed $450 Billion](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/322826-south-korea-commits-450-billion-to-chase-semiconductor-dominance) to invest in the semiconductor business over the next 9 years.   


While there are a number of large companies which are well positioned to get  a boost with the new impetus in funding, there are also some smaller companies which should be worth a watch and can really go parabolic. Here are the ones on my list (listing only penny stocks here below $5)

&#x200B;

1. [$MOSY](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/371638) **($4.09 currently)** \- It had a really good Friday where it spiked up nearly 50% with really good volume and finished the day fairly strong with only a slight dip in after hours. Despite the effort of shorts to drag it down, there was heavy buying in around the $4 mark which pushed it back up . It also has low float (only 3.51M and and nearly 20% short ratio which makes it ripe for a huge parabolic spike) with the US funding news that came out recently
2. [$WISA](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/goto/evaluate/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=WISA) **($3.69 currently) -** had  a decent friday (7% gain) with low volume but this is another one which likes to run on semiconductor news
3. [PXLW](https://www.aaii.com/stock/ticker/PXLW) \- (**$3.15** currently) - Decent friday, 8% gain as well and good volume. Relatively high float (47M) but its the cheapest one right now)

  
Other ones which I am watching are $LEDS( Low float and very popular but more than $5) and $RESN (which is another penny stock but not as popular as the first 2)

THORNTON, CO, May  17, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via [NewMediaWire](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Nhyq7swWKo0MmrdYZg8ZPxokKoW4LPp1s5VIJPkEV7LA6gV_I4OEFeZmSmCPMsEFZ9WykSWxHQPJrTfgGC6ZQg==)  ‒ Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc. (OTC: ASTI), a developer and  manufacturer of state-of-the-art, lightweight and flexible thin-film  photovoltaic (PV) solutions (“Ascent” or the “Company”), announces that  the Company has completed the delivery of a major contract for its  HyperLight thin-film modules for high altitude airship applications. The  HyperLight family of modules further reduces packaging and PV module  mass, achieving best-in-class power-to-weight ratio (Specific Power) of  over 350 W/kg for a fully laminated product on an airship, while  streamlining customer operations to integrate the modules to their  application.

The shipment represents the third and the largest  order from the customer since March 2018. The customer is the developer  of the world’s most advanced unmanned, helium-filled airship operating  in the stratosphere at an altitude greater than 60,000 feet above sea  level. The robust, versatile and solar-powered high-altitude platform  aims to provide several services, including to deliver high-speed  internet directly-to-device, enable high-resolution real-time Earth  imagery, and facilitate other humanitarian endeavors. 

Ascent’s  flexible, ultra-lightweight, monolithically-integrated photovoltaics  (PV) are based on the copper-indium-gallium-selenium (CIGS) chemistry  and will benefit various future missions, ranging from CubeSats, solar  sails, and potentially missions to the moon and Mars. In order to obtain  the necessary data to determine how flexible CIGS performs in the space  environment, Ascent’s PV modules have been undergoing extensive  evaluation for years, including protracted and demanding ground  simulation test and, as a part of the 10th Materials International Space  Station Experiment (MISSE-X) flight experiment aboard the International  Space Station that was launched on November 17, 2018 for a duration of  over one year. The upcoming LISA-T demonstration, part of NASA’s  Pathfinder Technology Demonstrator 4 CubeSat slated for launch in 2022,  will also include Ascent’s flexible CIGS as part of its further  photovoltaic experiment. 

Dr. Joseph Armstrong, Founding Team  Member, Chief Technology and Chief Operating Officer of Ascent Solar,  said, ""We have noted previously that Ascent's thin-film CIGS PV  technology produces modules with the highest power-to-weight ratio, and  this characteristic is incredibly important for aerospace, near-space,  and space applications. We were able to provide our customer with a  unique modular product that is designed to reduce part count  significantly over our competition, while providing the ability and  flexibility to integrate the modules into different form factors for  different applications as their product evolves. Based upon results from  the first two orders supplied to them, we worked with the customer to  significantly reduce the mass of the PV module while including  in-laminate circuit protection to enable them to streamline their  integration process as well. It is a testament to our Ascent Solar team  that we were able to complete this order that dramatically improved upon  performance from earlier designs while overcoming significant  challenges of the past 15 months.""

""This contract is by far the  single largest PV sales contract in the corporate history of Ascent  Solar, which follows the success of multiple large shipments of such  customized high-voltage superlight thin-film for high altitude  applications,"" said Victor Lee, CEO and President of Ascent Solar  Technologies, Inc. ""The contract is not only significant in value but  also underscores the power of Ascent's proprietary technology to address  these rapidly emerging and growing premium PV markets. We hope that  this contract is only the 'tip of the iceberg' as the project, if  successfully launched, is expected to be rolled out on a much larger  scale in the future.""

If we’ve learned anything from recent events it’s that the hedge funds that are taking advantage of retail investors can also be turned in opportunities. FAMI recently dropped to a historic low after a recent offering. As they normally do it started a slow rise back towards normalcy. Shortly after, a filing stating SABBY took a nearly 10% stake in Fami was released. The price has been slowly falling ever since. Due to the now low price of entry and relatively low amount of outstanding shares as well as the new short selling rules being considered and those going into effect there is a seemingly good opportunity for retail investors to drive this forward. Tactics in doing so are now very familiar and we are all aware.

1) **The shift towards lab grown gems**: The lab grown gem movement is picking up especially as millennials / younger buyers increasingly prefer buying stones that are ethically grown / sourced and have higher resale value - both counts on which mined diamonds perform rather poorly.

And leading jewelers are picking up on the trend. For instance, Pandora - the biggest jewelry seller in the world by volume - recently announced that they will only use lab-grown diamonds by 2022.

As sellers of high-quality lab grown diamonds and of Moissanite - a close diamond replacement that’s as colorless, more brilliant, and almost as hard as a diamond, Charles and Colvard stands to benefit from this secular shift.

2) **Moissanite leaders**: Charles and Colvard are the pioneers in creating Moissanite, and the market leader / a premium brand in the space, known for the highest quality gems. And Moissanite in specific is gaining a ton of traction within the shift towards lab grown gems / diamond replacements.
Covid tailwinds: The pandemic resulted in a lot of weddings being deferred. Expect sales to increase as the pent-up wedding ring sales pick up in latter half of the year.

3) **Insider purchases; no one’s selling**: In the last 6 months, insiders (management / directors) purchased ~670K shares from the open market (~2.3% of total shares issued). And not a single sale. That’s a massive vote of confidence.

4) **Cheap valuation**: Expect a valuation of $140M (stock price: $4.8) - a 75% upside from current levels. Assumptions / details below:

- Solid balance sheet: $19.7M in cash; ~$5.4M in debt / leases. Leaves a net cash position of $14.4M

- Assuming a conservative revenue growth of 10% for the next financial year (FY 2022), expect a revenue of ~$42M

- Assuming similar net income margins (~15%) as FY21 (seems reasonable - very little non-recurring items and don’t see any major drivers moving margins one way or the other), expected net income of $6.3M
Using a 20x P/E (conservative for a company expected to grow at well over 10% yoy), get an EV of $126. Add the net cash of $14M and you get a valuation of ~$140M.

The two big risks I see:

1) As more leading jewelry brands shift their attention to the lab-grown gem space, competition can heat up pressuring margins and growth. Can also be a good thing - increases the size of the overall pie.

2) It’s a tiny company with a market cap of $80M. Stocks in this range are subject to manipulation and other risks. So even if the long term thesis plays out, in the short term, expect to ride through some hefty volatility.

79,2021-05-17,nenznj,pennystocks,"I´m not a financial advisor, I´m a noob and you should always do the opposite of what I say.
However, I have taken a lot of time to find the right penny stock for my own portfolio. Since recently I got my eye on a company called InnerScope Hearing Technologies Inc. (INND) currently trading around 2 cents. 

About InnerScope 
InnerScope Hearing Technologies (INND) offers affordable app-controlled, self-adjusting hearing technology for consumers with mild-to-moderate hearing loss to purchase over-the-counter hearing aids without being seen by a hearing care professional.

Approximately 48 million Americans experience age-related hearing loss, including two-thirds of adults between the ages of 70 to 79. Yet only a small share of Americans with hearing loss - around 14 percent - use hearing aids, primarily due to their high cost. Hearing aids are not covered by Medicare or most private insurance plans, and out-of-pocket costs for a single hearing aid average $2,400 - far out of reach for many consumers.

INND is a manufacturer, distributor and retailer of FDA-Registered direct-to-consumer (DTC) app-controlled, self-adjusting hearing aids and personal sound amplifier products, doctor-formulated dietary hearing & tinnitus supplements, and assorted ear & hearing health-related products (collectively hearing products). Its mission is to improve the quality of life of the 70 million people in North America who suffer from hearing impairment and/or hearing-related issues. - Matthew Moore, President and CEO of InnerScope

Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Legislation Signed into Law
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) applauded the enactment of the bipartisan Over-the-Counter (OTC) Hearing Aid Act signed into law as part of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Reauthorization Act of 2017.

""This law will make a life changing difference for millions of Americans who experience hearing loss but can't access the hearing aid technology they need because of high costs and excessive regulations,"" - Senator Warren (D-mass) 

Recent collaborations with Skyline Corporate Communications Group
INND an emerging and disruptive leader in the Direct-to-Consumer Hearing Technology space, is pleased to announce today (May 17th) that it has retained the services of Skyline Corporate Communications Group, LLC (""Skyline"") to assist with the management of its investor relations and corporate communications activities within the financial community.

“We are very pleased to welcome InnerScope Hearing Technologies Inc. to our compelling and growing base of diverse clients. InnerScope is entering an exciting phase as it works to bring its financials current and up-list its security to a higher trading tier. – Scott Powell President & CEO of Skyline Corporate Communications Group, LLC",[],1

Edit 2: Wow. I was right!! GTT successfully received a debt extension, bankruptcy is currently out of the picture. This may be the catalyst this stock needed. If this does not bolster the price action, this may prove my hypothesis that bankruptcy was always a nominal risk and that its low valuation comes purely from hedge funds shorting the stock.

82,2021-05-17,neq0tt,pennystocks,"Hello r/pennystocks. I have a history of posting to r/wallstreetbets but this is my first post here, as the ticker in question has a market cap of <$1B. I’ve taken the time to put together this DD but would appreciate any critical commentary if you see something I’m missing.

**TL;DR:** As the writer of the EndGame series of \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\] DD on r/wallstreetbets, I believe [ATOS](https://www.google.com/search?q=atos+stock&oq=at&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i59l2j69i61l2j69i60j69i65.823j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) has the characteristics of \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\] when I wrote about it in my [EndGame part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/): “a **ridiculously asymmetric investment”.** I’m largely out of \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\] and growing a position in ATOS as my next play. (Wishing the best for everyone still in \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\]!). **ATOS has the passive-buying-loop buying impact of \[Redacted Retail EV Stock\] with the gamma+short squeeze of \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\] all in one.**

# Why you should and shouldn’t listen to me

**Why you should listen:**

I wrote the EndGame series of DD posts ([post history](https://www.reddit.com/user/FatAspirations/posts/?sort=top)) to WSB on \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\] pretty early on, starting when \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\] was <$20. As the saga continued, I provided price targets as well as multiple updates and explained price action along the way, and even posted post-squeeze 1 that people should have been buying back in at $50. As someone who studied \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\] hard prior to the squeeze, I feel somewhat qualified to say that **ATOS actually has similar upside potential to \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\] when it was <$40.**

**Why you shouldn’t listen:**

* Prior to last year, I had no active trading experience. I have been a passive trader most of my life.
* I have no professional financial training and am not a financial advisor.
* For all you know, I could be a 15-year old writing this in my underwear from my mom’s basement.
* As you know, equities with cap < $1BN are highly volatile, and biotechs are highly speculative. Investing in a biotech with cap <$1BN and no active revenue stream might be more retarded than buying DOGE during Elon’s monologue on SNL.

# About ATOS

[ATOS](https://www.google.com/search?q=atos+stock&oq=&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), or Atossa Therapeutics is a drug-development company, founded in 2008. It has somewhere between 5-15 full-time employees. Atossa has two major streams:

* Breast Cancer\*\*:\*\* Endoxifen - a drug that has recently finished phase II trials successfully, and an antigen receptor therapy for breast cancer treatment.
* Covid-19: AT-301 helps with covid-19 recovery, and AT-H201 specifically targeted at lung-function for covid-19 patients.

I won’t go deep into the drug-development side of things because that’s not why I’m in this play, but if you’re interested read this [excellent DD site on Endoxifen](https://sites.google.com/view/atos-dd-endoxifen/).

# Financials

On Friday, ATOS released their [1Q 2021 financial results](https://atossatherapeutics.com/atossa-therapeutics-announces-first-quarter-2021-financial-results-and-provides-corporate-update/).

## Assets, Debt, Revenue

* The company has **$138M in cash**
* No debt
* They burn about $3M a quarter, meaning their cash reserves should last them until 2024

## Stock Price Analysis, Shares Outstanding, Market Cap potential

* ATOS ended the day on Friday trading at $2.90 at market close.
* There are roughly 120M shares currently outstanding, putting the market cap at $351M.
* Remember, ATOS has $137M, or \~**$1.14/share in cash**. This means that the company, minus the cash position, is **currently valued at $213M or \~$1.78/share.**

Regarding some notes on potential market cap and share price targets:

* From [this site](https://sites.google.com/view/atos-dd-endoxifen/): “Gilead acquired Immunomedics in 2020 for 21B. Their drug, Troldevy, addresses the HR-/HER2- subtype (10% of all breast cancers) with projected sales of $480M for 2022. If we used **21B as the upper-bound valuation, ATOS would be worth $175/share**. A more conservative target would be **4B, pricing ATOS at $33/share**. Keep in mind that Endoxifen treats HR+ subtypes which accounts for at least 68% of all breast cancers.”

**The real kicker is the coming epic catalyst.**

# Why is ATOS up so much in the last few days? Why might it continue?

ATOS has had a crazy run in the last couple of weeks, running up 91% from $1.52 at the low on April 19 to its close on Friday. Why?

## Who buys stock?

Before I go into the next part, you really need to understand this breakdown. Most people don’t really understand why \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\] rallied so hard and think it was a short squeeze. For the most part, it wasn’t. Shorts didn’t cover in droves until after the brokers shut buying down.

Who buys stock? It roughly buys down into the following six categories:

* **Investors:** This includes both active managers at institutions and individuals, who buy the company, valuing the business based on conducting [fundamental DD like this](https://sites.google.com/view/atos-dd-endoxifen/).
* **Insiders:** Insiders are issued stock as part of their compensation, either through shares or options. In some cases, when insiders are strongly bullish relative to the current price, insiders can purchase shares on the open market during open trading windows.
* **Speculators:** Trade mechanics like crayon artists or near-term speculators buy stock based on some justification that someone is about to pay more for it in the future.
* **Short covers**: Investor/speculators that previously shorted the stock buy-to-cover their short positions either when the price has gone badly against them or to take profit on their shorts.
* **Passive Investment:** Funds that track that S&P 500, Russell 2000, or others need to buy equities included in the index at the decreed-upon weighting.
* **Market-makers (MMs):** MMs buy stock to hedge the call options they sell, or short stock to hedge the puts they sell when speculators or investors load up.

Now the really key thing to **understand is their likelihood to purchase stock as the price of the stock is going up**:

* **Investors:** Fundamental investors will be **less likely** to buy a stock if the price has gone up too much. This is generally because their valuation models no longer signal a green light. **However,** there are huge swaths of the investment community that **will not invest in an equity until it has reached a certain market cap.** For example, our own beloved r/wallstreetbets won’t even allow discussion of a ticker until it hits $1B in market cap. What this means is that **if ATOS hits >$8.5/share, the market for equity buyers will increase dramatically.**
* **Insiders:** Insiders are issued stock periodically regardless of price. When insiders actively purchase, they largely behave like fundamental investors and are more likely to buy when the price is low relative to their future valuations.
* **Speculators:** It’s largely unpredictable here, but many speculators trade momentum and will buy-in as the stock is trending up and paper-hand when the stock is trending down. **However,** if speculators have a reason to believe in a future event (earnings releases, index inclusions, ELON on SNL, etc.) they will buy or sell leading up to the event and generally liquidate at the event.
* **Short covers**: Shorts may try to double-down on short-term upward price movement of the stock they’re shorting, as with enough shorting power they can move it down. **However**, when the price has gotten too far out of control, they will be forced to cover either by their own risk management teams or their brokers liquidating their positions. So shorts are **more likely to buy when the price has gone up significantly**.
* **Passive investors:** Passive investment indices are **largely price-indiscriminate,** meaning that if Vanguard needs to buy 1,000,000 shares of ATOS, Vanguard will buy 1,000,000 shares of ATOS whether it is $3 or $30 on the day it needs to buy. Normally, it’s very difficult to predict when passives will buy an equity. **However, the one predictable time is initial index inclusion.** The first time an equity gets included into a major index (S&P 500, Russell 2k), there will be a major buy-in event on a specified date. This is exactly what happened to \[Redacted Retail EV Stock\] this year, when \[Redacted Retail EV Stock\] climbed 60% after it was announced as being added to the S&P and then another 6% on Dec 18, with **most of that gain happening in the final 5 minutes of trading on Dec 18.**
* **Market-Makers:** MMs are our best friend. Because MMs have to stay delta-neutral relative to their sold option positions, **MMs buy more as the price goes up.** If there are a lot of call options, and preferably low liquidity in the underlying, this can lead to what is called a “gamma squeeze” and is **exactly what happened to \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\] in January**, where for 3 weeks in a row \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\] gamma squeezed and all call options ended ITM, regardless of strike. For 3 weeks in a row, MMs added higher strikes to \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\] and for 3 weeks in a row, every strike ended the next week ITM. \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\] was the mother of all gamma squeezes - not the mother of all short squeezes. (MOAGS, NOT MOASS).

This is most of them. There are some edge cases (like Politicians, who are like Investors/Speculators but with insider information they can unrestrictedly trade against).

Now let’s talk about how all of this is relevant to ATOS.

## Dilution update

ATOS climbed 23% on Friday largely because Atossa retired a proposal that was going to allow them to issue up to another 325M shares of stock, which would have driven crazy amounts of dilution and could have led to a massive share price decline. As soon as the threat of this dilution was removed, a massive number of investors and speculators piled in.

&#x200B;

## Endoxifen Update by June 30

In their [annual letter](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/02/10/2173316/0/en/Atossa-Therapeutics-President-and-CEO-Dr-Steven-C-Quay-Issues-Annual-Letter-to-Stockholders-Highlighting-Key-Accomplishments-and-Strategy-for-2021.html), Atossa  reported some bullish news on their phase 2 trials but also promised an update, which means potential phase 3 news, by June 30:

* “*Oral Endoxifen in the Window of Opportunity Between Diagnosis and Surgery. In 2020, we made tremendous progress developing oral Endoxifen in the window of opportunity between diagnosis of breast cancer and surgical treatment. In May 2020, we reported interim results from our Phase 2 study in Australia showing a statistically significant (p=0.031) reduction of about 74% in tumor cell proliferation was achieved in the initial patients, as measured by Ki-67, over an average 22 days of dosing. Ki-67 is a recognized standard measurement of breast cancer cell proliferation. Six out of the initial six (100%) patients experienced a significant reduction in Ki-67 and each had a Ki-67 below 25% after treatment, which is the threshold identified in research by others for predicting overall survival. Results to date from this open-label study are sufficiently compelling that we have halted the study,* ***shortening our development time-line by approximately one year.*** ***In the second quarter 2021, we plan to report final data from the study and obtain input from the FDA to inform our pathway for further development in the U.S.****”*

## Russell 2000 inclusion

This is THE massive catalyst that I believe is not even close to priced in. Prior to March of this year, ATOS has not been included in *any* *passive benchmarks.* (In March of this year, Vanguard added it to its total stock market index and bought about 3M shares).

However, over $9T **(Trillion)** of passive investment funds are [tied to the Russell US indices](https://www.ftserussell.com/press/annual-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-measures-resilient-us-equity-market).

The Russell 1000 is the top 1000 highest US-based companies by market cap, but most investment money here is benchmarked instead to the S&P 500.

The Russell 2000 is the bottom 2000 of the top 3000 (i.e. rank 1001-3000) highest US based companies by market cap.

For equities in the Russell already, the index weights are calculated daily roughly equal to company\_market\_cap/total\_index\_cap.

**However, Russell conducts a reconstitution once a year.** This is an annual event during which equities are added and removed from the index. Here are the key dates:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xj45xwnijqz61.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=01fa05aa2ebd3c97540b4bfdbf5dfff8da5f33f8

Let’s start with May 7. May 7, or “rank day” is the day where all **eligible** US equities are ranked by market cap, and the top 3000 are included in the Russell indices. If you want go deep, you can read [this document on the methodology](https://research.ftserussell.com/products/downloads/Russell-US-indexes.pdf), but eligibility is mostly:

1. Be a US company **(CHECK)**
2. Have more than 5% of votable shares out there held by unrestricted shareholders **(CHECK)**
3. Be traded on a major exchange (**CHECK)**
4. Minimum closing price > $1 on rank day (Atos closed at $2.74 on rank day) (**CHECK)**
5. Total Market Cap > $30M (**CHECK)**
6. No UBTI business (i.e. not a REIT - **CHECK)**
7. Not an LLC, SPAC, ETF **(CHECK)**

**AS of MAY 7, ATOS met all eligibility criteria for Russell 2000 inclusion for the first time.** Additionally, **at a closing price of $2.74/share, ATOS’s market cap was \~$330M, putting it firmly in the top 3000**.

I believe that speculators have been loading up on ATOS on the belief of the Russell inclusion, which will be announced officially on June 4. Some of the smartest funds that originally bought into \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\] have just released 13Fs on ATOS, like Renaissance Technologies with 3M shares ([disclosed 05/13](https://fintel.io/so/us/atos)):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0ja2x2yjjqz61.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d94c3b1c4ac6d14f4637fbd1b21d957e1b9ea45

## The explosive trigger: Call OI + Passive Buying Loop

Here’s how this could get **explosive.** The total call open interest for ATOS is [**395,394 as of Friday, May 14.**](https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/ATOS/OpenInterestTrends/) ATOS has a put-call ratio of 0.1 - meaning that it’s 90% calls.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/spgoq5vkjqz61.png?width=469&format=png&auto=webp&s=813c8227d04feb067f21db8b478a9539927d3e15

Take a look at the OI I see for July calls on ATOS from IBKR (Russell-tracked passive funds will buy on June 25). That’s a **LOT OF FUCKING CALLS** compared to puts.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/od0g41xljqz61.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fe3d730dfad7ec86e1192da06ab9087cffd1a43

**So here’s how this is going to go down.**

* FTSE will announce Russell 2000 adds on June 4.
* If, as I believe, ATOS is included, **active managers and other speculators will front-run passive indices** just as they did with \[Redacted Retail EV Stock\] before passive made their initial entry on Dec 18.
* As ATOS is this rinky-dinky stock with [<10% institutional ownership](https://fintel.io/so/us/atos), **liquidity is ultra-low, meaning that large purchases will meaningfully drive the price up.**
* **As the price goes up, MMs will have to buy more and more shares to hedge the sold call options.**
* The act of MMs buying their shares to hedge **will also drive the price up, leading to more shares needed to hedge, driving another massive gamma squeeze**
* Passive indices will have to buy their shares of ATOS - regardless of price - all at once at the end of the trading day on June 25 driving up a massive spike in the price as MMs + Passive + Speculators pile-in all at once.
* **Somewhere along the way, the shorts will have to cover, driving the price up as well.**
* After June 25, the indices will have bought in and will be holding shares. **Liquidity from that point on will be further reduced, so any calls expiring ITM will further drive up the price in a continued gamma squeeze.**

# Oh boy, here we go again with the shorts

Who doesn’t love burning some shorts while making money? ATOS - like \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\], has some interesting shorting going on. It’s not as heavily shorted as \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\] ever was, but there is still some very interesting short activity here.

## Melvin is Dead. A New Villain Enters the Ring - Sabby, et al.

Melvin Capital is the now infamous figurehead firm at the head of the shorting ring behind \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\].

**Melvin, frankly, was dumb.** Melvin & co didn’t close their shorts when \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\] was trading <$4 share, when the market cap was worth less than the net cash on hand, and when Burry and u/DeepFuckingValue famously took their positions. Melvin also didn’t close when Ryan Cohen, a boy-genius e-commerce billionaire meme-guru decided to throw his weight into the ring.

**Sabby** is downright **evil.** Sabby, and a few other “investors” in ATOS, are vulture funds. [Here’s a bit about Sabby.](https://utopiacap.com/2020/03/25/sabby-management/) The **TL;DR:** is that vulture funds get large positions in rinky-dink stocks to convince the board they mean well, then short multiples of their long positions while using their relationship with the company to either use inside information against the price or to convince the company to dilute itself into oblivion.

## How F’d are the shorts?

I was concerned before, but I’m pretty convinced by 3 things:

1. The retraction of the proposal to add 325M shares to the float, likely put there by Sabby and co, is suggestive that the C-level execs have woken up to the ways they were getting fucked by Sabby.
2. ATOS shares short [increased by 8M in the period from 12/31/2010 - 1/15/2021](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ATOS/short-interest/). Look at the chart. **8M shorts shorted at the recent bottom, shorting at less than $1.25 and likely at less than $1/share.** At $2.90/share, those 8M shorts are **already 300% under.**
3. ATOS is a hard-to-borrow stock with low availability (only 50K on IBKR last I checked), and NO shortable shares on Fidelity:

I’m seeing some very suspicious failure-to-deliver activity:

# Important similarities to [Redacted Retail Meme Stock] pre-squeeze

There’s a few things that really remind me of \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\]:

1. Low liquidity: it’s hard to buy large blocks of shares without driving the price up. I have tried.
2. Inability of mm’s to hedge calls appropriately: given the low liquidity, it’s difficult for MMs to perfectly hedge calls given that the act of hedging drives price up. See item 1.
3. Strong near-term catalyst not priced in: Russell won’t announce until June 4. Look at \[Redacted Retail EV Stock\]’s history. \[Redacted Retail EV Stock\] ran up 65% from announcement to inclusion - and that’s with much higher liquidity.
4. Low starting market cap relative to potential cap - see analysis referenced above. This is still a cheap bet.
5. Strong financial footing of the company ruling out bankruptcy risk - $137M cash in bank. No bankruptcy thesis.

# How might this go wrong?

Prior to throwing a bunch of money at this, I wanted to understand all the ways shit could go awry. I’ve gone through the following concerns and gotten comfortable enough with the risk to take and grow a large position.

There’s a good number of risks nicely outlined in the [10-Q](https://dd7pmep5szm19.cloudfront.net/2358/0001437749-21-012213.htm), but I’m going to call out the big ones as is relevant to this play:

* Dilution: While the major dilution effort was retracted on Friday, the company is still authorized to issue up to 180M shares (120M outstanding now). There are an unknown number of non-exercised warrants out there with strike prices from $1.05 to $4.05. I estimate that there’s about 30M shares worth remaining but no way to know for sure.

* Russell Inclusion: Even though it hits every single checkmark, and the market cap is clearly enough, FTSE may come up with some reason to not include it. If you want to be safe but miss out on some potential gains, you could wait for June 4.
* Shorts may limited their losses through the purchase of warrants. This would be an expensive hedge, but possible.
* Paper-handed traders selling before June 25 - I don’t think most people understand the immensity of the impact that an index inclusion for a penny stock is going to have. Active traders will drive the price up between June 4 and June 25, and some folks may paper-hand out before the major buy on June 25.
* Drugs don’t work out - always a risk with biotech. This is more of a risk if you’re playing this for the long term. I’m not.

This is a **highly asymmetric play.** Not everything needs to hit for it to work. On the downside, it hits cash value of $1.14/share. On the upside, I think we're looking at double digits post gamma squeeze + passive buying.

# How to Be Smart and Not Lose All Your Money

With any heavily shorted stock, there’s a lot of dirty trading tactics that you need to be cautious of. I’m going to re-share some of what I said previously in \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\] posts as it’s heavily relevant here as well. Here’s some things to be careful about.

* **Going too far OTM on calls will hurt you & a potential gamma squeeze:** Currently, ATOS has the highest call IV of any stock out there:

https://preview.redd.it/nywjt3erjqz61.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&s=c096fd8165cf0a99d0db7185dd67acdf07f444de

* Buying a call far OTM has lower likelihood of success, and in the case of of ATOS, is really, really, really expensive. The best way to play this is with shares, but if you’re going to buy calls better to go closer ITM (July 2.5c, 3c, etc.). Not only will you be more likely to win, but MM’s will have to buy more shares to delta-hedge the call as the price ramps up, so it will positively impact a gamma squeeze. If you buy 7c FDs, MMs won’t need to hedge that unless ATOS more than doubles in price, so you’re not really having any positive underlying movement on the price unless shit squeezes hard.
* It can be tempting to trade-up your options for higher return, but be mindful of the delta impact. You may actually be driving the sale of shares by MMs when you don’t mean to. For example, if you sell a .5 delta call for 2 .2 delta calls, that’s a net reduction of 10 shares that MMs have to hold long as a hedge.
* **Be careful about being short any calls:** Ooh, high IV, might as well short some calls right? Maybe stop and think about call pricing - **why is the IV so high?** Someone out there really, really thinks ATOS is massively underpriced and they’re willing to pay out the ass for leverage based on their conviction. Do you know enough to bet against them? No?
* **You can still take advantage of high IV by selling puts.** At the time of this writing, ATOS closed at about $2.9 a share. **The 3p expiring in 7 days (May 21) are selling for $.50!** Selling the $3p means either of the two outcomes happen: either you get shares at $2.5 in 7 days (which is better than buying at $2.9 today, in case it goes down), or you pocket **20% return on capital in 7 days.** If you’re selling puts, **make sure you have cash to cover and don’t sell puts on margin.**
* **Be careful about buying on margin.** Brokers are rapidly increasing margins. If you bought on margin with 2:1 leverage, and the stock went up 100%, you’d be in margin call even without a margin change. If the broker moves margin against you, you’ll get to margin call faster.
* **Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose.** I was in \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\] for months before it took off. Over-extending yourself means you’re more likely to sell on dips and lose the upside. Consider spreading your purchases out. I’ve held through **50% drawdowns** on \[Redacted Retail Meme Stock\] but wouldn’t have been able to if I put too much in. So don’t be retarded and go all-in on this pennystock even if it’s an amazing bet.
* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It’s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. DON’T SET STOP LOSSES.
* **OPEX.** Imagine if every trader out there took profits of their calls at expiration. In that scenario, MMs sell the shares they used to hedge the calls, leading to a downward drift in price. If instead people rolled forward winning calls, for example, MMs would not necessarily sell the hedge (depends on delta). Selling calls before expiry if you just want to take profits sometimes means you can avoid a drop on OPEX.
* **Don’t sell on dips.** You’re only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it’s heading up. *Sell high, not low, retards.*
* **Save dry powder to buy on dips.** Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities. Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points. ATOS has incredible daily volatility. Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill. **Have patience when buying.**
* **Don’t buy calls on rips.** With everyone expecting a squeeze *at any moment* option premiums that are already high rocket to insane levels in minutes. You’re absolutely fucked if you buy calls on rips, even if you’re right.
* **Don’t buy more than you’re willing to lose.** You need to hold through the dips, and be ok with the extreme volatility. IF you put too much into this all at once, you’re going to get scared when the price goes against you.
* **HOLD.** There is so much upside in ATOS, *that it doesn’t matter what price you buy now if you have patience and wait for inclusion.* **Don’t give up your shares for cheap.**

83,2021-05-17,neq6pj,pennystocks,"Hey guys, I’m here to tell you this is the perfect moment to invest part of your assets in a superb project that is now coming off the ground really fast. This coin has been in quiet development for the past 3 years and the time has come for some big strides. This product has grown an enormous amount over the last couple of months and now is the time it will start going berserk. It is at the point where the lifting off starts and you really don't want to be late on this one. Don't say I didn't warn you! I am talking about EUNO, a coin that will be unique in paying possibilities at your local store. A lot of coins support payments, but this is the first coin that will do so and not require a merchant or store to accept crypto payments. EUNO has created EunoPay, which works in a way that you can pay with EUNO (with very low fees) and the merchant will receive Euros US dollars or any other relevant currency. And with a very low marketcap, EUNO can still go x100 or even x1000. My advice will be to buy EUNO as fast as you can while it's lower than 0,01$. After that it will still be a buy, but before that moment you can really have an insane moonshot. I will post some upsides and downsides below and you can make your own decision instead of listening to me. Please also have a look at the whitepaper of EUNO at their website and don't miss out on this opportunity, you might really regret it.

Upsides: 
- Low marketcap (~15 million) with insane opportunities to grow. 
- Working project with real life application in the form of EunoPay. 
- Low fees, which is extremely important for mass adoption. 
- Real collaboration with specialized crypto player named Baanx. 
- Great development team, full marketing budget.

Downsides: 
- Low liquidity. 
- No big mainstream listings.

This coin has tremendous value and it will not be long until prices go a lot higher after which you will blame yourself for not investing. This is really the best time to buy EUNO, right before a big surge. Think about your future and get some cheap EUNO before it's to late.

Euno CEO/COO Faustino Hernandez will have a zoom call on 21 of May at 2pm Arizona Time. Check him out on twitter for more information, his handle is @P_Bateman86 and @EunoCoin

ADMA produces immune globulin for infusions to treat over 100+ disorders. 

I am followed on Twitter by the 40 year going strong Immune Deficiency Foundation. My ex-wife would not be alive if  it were not for receiving Ivig transfusions. 

ADMA appeared on my radar when it recently received FDA approval to increase the manufacture of IVIG from 400,000 to 600,000 units. The PR came out.  That also included the forward looking statement that this is expected to add 300 million in revenue. Nothing is bad about this news.

On that day. The volume was over 200 million shares. It popped up from middle 1’s to 2.50’s and then by end of day it was squashed back down. Over the next few days I watched from deep level II the huge blocks of stock trading back and forth bringing the stock price down. 

ADMA has 6 analysts assigned to it. They have figures of 6 to 14(?) I believe. Institutional ownership is increasing (nearing 50%). Insiders are buyers. I checked their job offerings and they have pet insurance as a fringe benefit for the positions I. Looked a. 

Three major companies account for ≈ 90% of the immune globulin transfusion market. Shire and two other big Pharma groups. 

1) ADMA is the next largest, and is opening up plasma collection centers (the raw product that is used to process and become the infusion therapy. The new center has great video and receiving PR with the Governor of South Carolina at grand opening of a new collection center and talk about the importance of donating plasma, the component that is processed by the companies to create different types of IVIG products. Some isolate high immune factor plasma or test for specific concentration to treat specific disorders. Cancer researchers and individual that have recorded a full organ transplant along with many disorders where people, like my former wife, was unable to build her own immune response to vaccines. So, she was constantly fighting infections until it was diagnosed and this treatment was in early stages but essentially it used to be an all day of slowly receiving a large collection of other people’s plasma with the immune factors like IgG or IgA that are needed. 

Why is ADMA attractive? ADMA is innovative and if you search for the Pfizer PR about the success of the Phase III trial for their COVID vaccine, it will state that three separate companies confirmed and quantified the immune response in participants. One company is ADMA. I worked in a research lab and know you don’t decide what company to work with lightly on such an critical trial. Bad data could have sunk their Phase III. 

ADMA is an American company. The others are not. They are building these collection centers to be a complete vertical growing producer of currently three existing approved FDA biologics and seeking to innovate with more. 

ADMA beat earning expectations. The fear is they will have another offering and dilute existing 150,000,000 million shares. The CEO acknowledged that taking the assets of the company as a value and dividing per share right no would be higher than the current price per share. They are aware the price does not reflect reality. 

Getting ADMA price up gets them money to hopefully prevent dilution, but if a person is investing longer term I don’t see this as an issue. However they will have money to reach profitability which will be 2024 per their statement, this company is a force in an area that needs IVIG more than ever. They have demonstrated the ability to take over a lab producing IvIG that failed inspection and lost FDA approval, and they had the skills to purchase and fix the issues and now they have the FDA approval reinstated for that particular formulation.

The CEO even suggested willingness for a buyout. if being bought out would be beneficial to the share holders. 

Reading the analyst reports and I read their prospectus l, even the USFDA reports of the plant and FDA letters. Thereis a disconnect with pps along with this interest in a Penny stock that the big name institutions are buying and holding and the price right now is≈$1.70’s. Articles from investors talk about their opinion on buying this under $3 and $2.

These are my observations. Googling my name will show you what medical schools I worked at but they do not endorse nor do I suggest that they gave me specific information for this, but I am not a bot. I just wanted to share a personal connection and associate it with observations on. Company. 

I benefit if ADMA goes up because I am long w/contracts  , so I am biased. I encourage researching the company and if you search Twitter for:

livingwithPI
#PIawareness
#primaryimmunodeficiency
#THINKZEBRA
#zebrastrong

April was National Primary Immunodeficiency Awareness Month and April 22-29, 2019 is World PI Week. The same time the stock was hammered down paradoxically for great FDA manufacturing increase approval. 

You will read the stories of lives changes by this product . You may not want to invest, but they are paying upwards of $500 for the first month of donating plasma.

224,2021-05-18,nf74sg,pennystocks,"I am not a financial advisor, nor analyst. The following are my thoughts and you should perform your own research before investing.
$PSRU is at an all time low; 95.5% of high in Feb 2020. $PSRU started just as the pandemic did.

So many penny stocks have had sharp 1600% - 2400% gains in the last few months. Will $PSRU see the same? No. The gains will be higher. Why? Because Xavier Mitchell is building ABA Canada (basketball) after acquiring the rights last year.  

They are starting two teams in CA (people will fill the stands because of low cost to attend. Players will play because there is a large supply of talent in the ABA price model). Providence Film Group has signed a large EB5 agreement. Streaming services have been acquired and will be used to start an ABA network (subscription service). 

Current market cap of only $342,000.  I am looking for a $30,000,000 cap within 18 months. Do the math... 8700%.  Perhaps more realistic is half that... $15,000,000. Still, that puts the share price at $0.50-ish. Right at the initial valuation when they took over the $PSRU ticker in Feb 2020.

Above is a real nice summary of the play. 

In short, they are expecting to have 60-70 wells in then next 5 years.  The first 5 will be done by end of year and should produce 200 MILLION revenue per year (50 million per quarter).  So, in 5 years you can expect/ hope for >2 BILLION in revenue per year from 60 wells (sure some will be dry). 

 No financing needed at this point as they are full funded for the 5 wells AND setting up their solar powered processing center (no share dilution).  Each well capex is minimal at less then 500k.  Great share structure with about 70k OS and 80k fully diluted.

264,2021-05-18,nf87ey,pennystocks,"Before we all pile into $TAWNF, I thought I'd provide the latest update.

1) TAWNF will NOT be bailed out by the government. 

This rebuffs claims that the company will again become state owned. 

&#x200B;

2) Today, creditors are to decide whether they will bail out $TAWNF. This includes the Finance Ministry of Thailand. 

Although the government have said they won't bail out $TAWNF, their presence at the creditors meeting is enough to imply they'll lend money to keep $TAWNF propped up.

&#x200B;

The importance of $TAWNF?

They are the ONLY flag carrier airline of Thailand. They enjoy preferential rights for the international flights they offer.  Thailand isn't about to let $TAWNF go under for this reason. 

&#x200B;

Bear case?

Thailand is currently experiencing a record number of covid cases. $TAWNF is not likely to be fully operational for the remainder of 2021, and maybe even some of 2022. 

&#x200B;

The Result:

$TAWNF is going to surge on likely news of a capital injection that would see it operate through the covid crisis. This does not fundamentally change the stock. Unless there is further news on how $TAWNF intends to get more people flying, I expect a selloff by the end of the week.

# Who they are

[Braxia Scientific](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZeNMKwvJmo) is leading the way in providing people who suffer from mental illness access to breakthrough treatments through our growing global network of multidisciplinary clinics while setting the standard of care. Braxia Scientific also aims to develop innovative ketamine and psychedelic drug formulations to provide high impact solutions for the future.

[They are divided into several companies](https://i.imgur.com/1GYepSO.png). They changed the name of the parent company since this image was filed in their amended listing statement. The parent company is now Braxia Scientific. This rebrand was planned over a year ago.

# Name/Date Aquired/Who they are

**Braxia** (formerly Champignon Brands) – The parent company, “the Company” hereafter. \[Braxia\] provides evidence-based best practices and global leadership in the implementation of ketamine in adults with depression. The product that derives from the foregoing service is what management believes to be the world’s largest data repository of clinical research data on adults with treatment-resistant depression. Champignon intends to use this data to develop NCEs suitable for Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.

**Altmed** **CRTCE** (4/20) – Operates multidisciplinary community-based clinics offering rapid-onset treatments for depression located in Ontario (Mississauga, Toronto and Ottawa) and Quebec (Montreal). In addition, management believes that CRTCE’s staff has published more peer-reviewed scientific papers documenting experience with ketamine in patients than any other center in the world. The CRTCE staff have published peer-reviewed scientific articles in the world’s leading psychiatric/medical journals including, but not limited to, The Lancet, World Psychiatry, and the American Journal of Psychiatry. They [recently published](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33726522/) a synthesis paper on Ketamine research in the American Journal of Psychiatry which is expected to be the authoritative statement of best practices for (es)ketamine implementation for adults with major depression. Current (es)ketamine monthly patient capacity is 1040 total between the clinics. Currently staffed by 6 psychiatrists and 50 consulting staff.

**Novo** – (3/20) A biotechnology company which is focused on developing the Novo IP, which relates to novel and innovative delivery systems for the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries

**Tassili** – (3/20) working to develop effective psilocybin-based therapeutics for the treatment of mild traumatic brain injuries and/or PTSD.

# Trials

* Phase 2 – **Psilocybin Trial** – Applying in June for approval, expected to start in September. Partnered with Braxia CEO’s nonprofit, the “Brain and Cognition Discovery Foundation.” This will be using the CRTCE clinics.
* Phase 1B – **Novo Ketamine Cream Study** – Approved 12/20, ongoing at two Hamilton area clinics. Phase 2 is expected to occur entirely within the Company’s clinic system.
* Phase 1B – **Novo IN Ketamine Study** – Finishing chemical analysis and stability work. Expected to start before end of 2021 (page 20)

# Upcoming Patents

* Expected to be submitted mid 2021
* Esketamine derivative
* Psilocybin derivative

# Patents Pending

* WIPO (PCT) Patent Appln No. CA2020/051040
   * CONTROLLED RELEASE FORMULATIONS OF MULTIPLE ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL AGENTS, AND PSILOCYBE-DERIVED AGENTS IN COMBINATION WITH CANNABIS-DERIVED AGENTS AND METHODS FOR THEIR USE
* WIPO (PCT) Patent Appln No. CA2020/051371
   * CONTROLLED RELEASE FORMULATIONS OF PSILOCYBE-DERIVED AGENTS AND METHOD FOR THEIR USE, AND METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR THREATING MILD TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY WITH POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER

Comparison to patents of other companies? [It isn’t even a competition](https://www.reddit.com/r/shroomstocks/comments/jdk3sk/11_patents_for_shrm/). Braxia is smoking the competition. (in case OP deletes the post, [image is here](https://i.imgur.com/SxbqmH3.png), red arrow isn't mine, sorry)

# Training Program

CRTCE is planning to implement an academy (the “CRTCE Academy”) to train healthcare providers on the implementation of ketamine and related psychedelics for adults with common mental health conditions. Once implemented, the CRTCE Academy is expected to train healthcare providers on pharmacology and integrated psychosocial/psychotherapeutic interventions that are evidence-based and, where required, approved by regulators. The CRTCE Academy is expected to certify healthcare providers and provide ongoing continuing medical.

# Recent Board Appointment

>On February 4, 2021, Champignon announced that Ms. Olga M. Cwiek had joined its board of directors. Ms. Cwiek served as a senior television executive at CBC and CTV specializing in television program acquisitions, labour and performer contract negotiations and design/administration of human resources policies and practices including human rights protections and enforcement. Champignon also announced the resignation of Bill Wilkerson, LL. D. (Hon) who had retired from its board of directors.

# Risks

If any of you are aware of this company, or bothered to look it up on Yahoo Finance, you are aware that they have had some regulatory / legal issues. What happened was their *former* CTO filed paperwork incorrectly for the acquisitions of Artisan, Novo and Tassili last year. Due to the previously misfiled paperwork, they filed the acquisition of Altmed incorrectly as well (should have been an RTO). Presumably this paperwork was correct, but based on the faulty paperwork filed previously. When Altmed (and the clinics) were acquired, it was a month later that the current CEO was appointed. It was a month after the current CEO was appointed that the hammer came down on the paperwork filed before he got there. Regulators put a halt on the stock. This only impacted the Canadian ticker, the US ticker was still trading. Their former CTO was incompetent. On several occasions he failed to file paperwork because he thought they didn’t need to, or it was filed incorrectly. Roger McIntyre fired the former CTO as well as the General Council. The CTO and General Council were all replaced. (details on page 12 of the 4/12/21 Filing Statement on Sedar)

Of course, this all had an impact on stock price. Where there is a big drop in stock price, there is a stock-drop lawsuit. These are the ambulance chasers of the stock world. The accounting error that led to all the problems and poor decisions is succinct.

>The Company determined that the intangible assets did not meet the definition of intangible assets for the purposes of international financial reporting standards and as result will be recorded as transaction costs in the Company's statement of loss and comprehensive loss. The effect of the restatement did not affect the Company's cash position.

Notably, nothing has materially changed for the company. They still own the IP, they still have the same cash etc. They just couldn’t book the IP as an intangible asset. As far as I have read in statements, all the other issues with paperwork have stemmed from this single error. Rounded up, the total change in intangible assets due to the correction is -14million.

>During the three most recently completed financial years: (i) no penalties or sanctions were imposed against Champignon or AltMed Capital by a court relating to securities legislation or by a securities regulatory authority (other than the BCSC Orders); (ii) no other penalties or sanctions were imposed by a court or regulatory body against Champignon or AltMed Capital that would likely be considered important to a reasonable investor in making an investment decision; and (iii) Champignon or AltMed Capital did not enter into any settlement agreements before a court relating to securities legislation or with a securities regulatory authority.

This was *after* regulators poured over their books, no one got in trouble. Right now, the ambulance chasers are rushing to represent the class. Deadline to file is June 9th. I hope/expect that the constant barrage of lawyer ads showing up on feeds for this company will go away after that.  I don’t see a former CBC exec being willing to join this board if the company was going to get slaughtered by these law firms.

The stock is no longer halted, all their financials were audited and submitted to regulators. Other than the stock-drop lawsuits, this event is now behind them.

# My thoughts

I don’t place much risk on the lawsuits. I think the biggest risk is their low stock price limiting their ability to raise funds and develop the company. Seeing as I think the company has strong value and I intend to accumulate more shares at these levels, I am not going to bitch too much about a low share price now, but it could be damaging if it continues for too long. For now, the Company has said they are well capitalized.

The current issues faced by the company are not a reflection of the current management, they are a reflection of the previous management. How they are handled *is* a reflection of the current management. During all this turmoil they have managed to seek new patents, expand, and start trials. To me, this signals that the management team is strong.

Clinic side, I see this company as the only serious contender. The CEO is an [absolute heavyweight](https://www.uhnresearch.ca/researcher/roger-s-mcintyre) in clinical pharmacology. Their strong patent acquisition and focused development of the company put them far ahead of their competition. He has even been running presentation circuits in uni's prior to his current position. Many are still on youtube.

>Dr. McIntyre was named by Clarivate Analytics/Thomson Reuters in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 as one of “The World’s Most Influential Scientific Minds”. This distinction is given by publishing the largest number of articles that rank among those most frequently cited by researchers globally in 21 broad fields of science and social science during the previous decade.

Right now I think they suffer from a public sentiment issue. They are often left out of conversations in this space. People that got in right after the IPO feel burned by the halt and stock drop. New investors only see the law firm ads when looking up the company, and they don't see them trending on their favorite subs. Furthermore, the company hasn’t done much in publishing their news during the halt. I think things are changing though. The halt is done, they finished rebranding to Braxia, the deadline for the law firms is June 9th, and there are several major catalysts on the horizon. Braxia used to be good at working with the media, I suspect they will be going on a blitz over the next couple of months ahead of their AGM.

The fact that all of this has them trading at <17% of their ATH less than a year ago is wild to me. Nothing significant has changed in my perception of the company. I saw all of this unfolding after the halt and began buying in. At the moment I think there is a good amount of liquidity from the pre-halt bagholders that people can get into this without much risk of slippage.  We are sitting near all-time lows, this isn’t a DD on some company they just ran 400%. You are absolutely buying into fear and negative sentiment and a stock that is probably pricing in more than a worst-case scenario. You are not buying into euphoria, so this is going to feel different than a lot of stocks that get DD’s on reddit. This isn't a meme stock. You want to know what a company looks like before it goes on a run from ATL? Its covered in shit. The share price is shit. The sentiment is shit. The media on it is shit. But the underlying company, with the right DD and a little clorox, looks good.

I see their edge coming from a regulatory and IP moat. I don't think any of their clinic competitors (NUMI and Field Trip) are remotely close to their caliber on this.

This is a mid to long term hold for me. I think this is a strong value play plagued by bad sentiment from poorly informed retail traders. If the stock were to pop instantly my ""sell half"" target would be $2. I think anything under $0.5 is borderline theft. If we get a normal bull trend up to $2 I would probably keep holding. I mean come on, patents for controlled of psilocybin and weed extracts is fucking awesome.",[],0

WEST  HOLLYWOOD, Calif., May  18, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LGBTQ Loyalty  Holdings, Inc. (OTC PINK: LFAP) (""LGBTQ Loyalty"" or “the Company''), a  diversity-and inclusion-driven financial methodology and data company,  announces through its wholly owned subsidiary, Loyalty Preference Index,  Inc., the launch of the **LGBTQ + ESG100 ETF** (NASDAQ: LGBT) today.

""The  launch of the much-anticipated LGBTQ + ESG100 ETF, is at a consequential  time for the LGBTQ community and our supportive allies, and a  monumental time for advancing equality. We are proud to provide  investors with the means to invest in top corporations that align with  their interests, and embrace equality, diversity and ESG principles in  the workplace.” said Bobby Blair Executive Chairman of the Board.

**First Quarter Financial Highlights**

* Overall Revenue increased 138% over 2020 comparable period.
* Product Sales increased 445% over 2020 comparable period.
* Cash on Hand increased 319% over 2020 comparable period.
* Wages & Benefits decreased 21% over 2020 comparable period.
* G&A decreased 22% from 2020 comparable period.
* Current Debt & Liabilities reduced by $709k over 2020 comparable period.
* Debt reduced by $165K in first quarter 2021.
* Loss from Operations decreased 8% from 2020 comparable period.
* Did not take on any new debt.

**First Quarter 2021 Business Highlights and Developments**

* Strong product sales, despite COVID-19.
* Broadened product offerings in the medical health and safety sectors, by adding Antigen, Antibody Rapid Test-Kits, and hearing health to product line.
* Significant development progress made on 4G SmartSole modules.
* Incorporating natural language processing (NLP) and voice assistant features into backend platform utilizing home assistant devices, such as Amazon Echo, Google Home or IBM Watson.
* Fulfilled multiple orders for PPE to government agencies including the United States Marine Corps, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
* Added over 1,500 new customers.
* Increased shareholder base by approximately 60%.

**Management commentary: Patrick Bertagna, GTX Corp CEO.**

With businesses across the country opening back up and overall general travel picking back up, we maintained strong PPE, Rapid Test-Kit and SmartSole pre order sales throughout the first quarter and saw a 445% increase in product revenues and a 138% increase in total revenue compared to Q1 2020 with a 22% decrease in SG&A. We added approximately 1,500 new customers, saw continued demand for our new SmartSoles with over 200 pre orders to date, and grew our shareholder base by approximately 60% during Q1 2021.

As we mapped out our 2021 post pandemic course, we did get more aggressive in our pricing and slightly reduced our gross margins in order to sell down our remaining PPE inventory, while shifting focus more on wearable tech products and gearing up for our Cat M1 LTE SmartSole launch.

Since we cannot accurately predict how long the PPE business will remain in demand, and based on the current events and sales trends, we expect to be transitioning out of many PPE products over the coming months and focus on the strong sellers in our product line while ramping up for the launch of the new SmartSoles, NFC Blockchain platform and other medical wearables such as our hearing health products. The continued demand for PPE during Q1 2021 did enable us to maintain our cash flow, continue to add new customers, expand our brand visibility, and reduce our debt by $165K, eliminating all but $1,800 of our variable priced convertible debt, leaving only fixed price, low interest rate debt on the balance sheet.

During the first quarter 2021, we began finalizing the design phase of our next generation miniaturized GPS tracking device, which will utilize a host of new technologies, including CatM1, NB-IoT, enhanced Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, for better accuracy, faster location requests and less power consumption and started working on testing, certification and ordering parts and components in order to prepare for production and launch. We also started working on a new version of our tracking app and new website. We also expanded our product offering under our hearing health product line and began the integration of Amazon Echo voice assisted capabilities into our backend portal.

Health & Safety, Track & Trace are the big buzz words that came out of 2020. Everyone wants to be safe and know where someone or something has been, which sits at the core of the GTX technology and IP portfolio. We are hearing from many of our B2B customers and international distributors that they want more tracking solutions. So, a big part of Q1 was making sure we get back to developing and launching new tracking technology products that will meet the global demand throughout 2021 and beyond. We also explored new partnerships and allocated resources for new research and development initiatives.

In summation, we navigated through the pandemic adding more product sales, more customers, more shareholders, less debt and liabilities and a much cleaner balance sheet. We hope all our stakeholders stay safe and healthy and we will keep updating everyone on our latest developments through our video podcast, press releases and newsletters.",[],1

The drug candidate, primarily being tested to improve anti-tumor activity, will also be studied and developed by Bristol Myers for immuno-oncology treatments including non-small cell lung cancer, which accounts for about 85% of lung cancer cases globally.

Bristol Myers has been betting on sales of its Opdivo drug to treat such cancers, but that market is currently dominated by Merck & Co's MRK.N rival treatment Keytruda.

Agenus will receive up to $1.36 billion in development, regulatory and commercial milestones in addition to double-digit royalties on net product sales. It will receive an upfront payment of $200 million.

The biotech company will retain options to conduct clinical studies under the development plan, and to test it in combination with certain other pipeline assets, and will co-promote AGEN1777 in the United States after commercialization.

537,2021-05-18,nfbxtc,pennystocks,"SRMX Stock: Little known company Saddle Ranch Media is behind Microsoft and Qualcomm

This small company is powering giants like Microsoft (MSFT) and Qualcomm (QCOM), you should be looking at Saddle Ranch Media (SRMX) and their subsidiary Tri Cascade, they released their quarterly report, 3 months ended March 2021 and there are some golden nuggets deep within the report.

SRMX is making big promising moves

Shares of Saddle Ranch Media is trading at $0.0032 per share. In February of 2021 the stock was trading as high as $0.0120 a share. I believe that this company can make it back to those levels given the relationships they have in place and the future potential of these business relationships.

According to SRMX’s earnings report, the golden nuggets are listed below:

Tri Cascade released its 5G M.2 module model SG500M2-X, which is embedded with Qualcomm 2nd generation SDX55 5G modem.
Tri Cascade released the PoC of TRITOM Guardian S100 for Azure IoT device security.
Tri Cascade entered into a Buy/Sell Arrangement and Platform under a Service Agreement with Avnet Inc. for TRITOM Guardian S100 and for other Tri Cascade products. (Avnet is a global leader of electronic components and services, guiding makers and manufacturers from design to delivery)
Tri Cascade entered into an authorized, formal Supplier relationship with Microsoft and received a purchase order from Microsoft for the Tri Cascade TRITOM Guardian S100 module, and successfully delivered the product to Microsoft in April, 2021.
While no revenue was recorded during the 3 months ended March 31, 2021, the company will report revenue in the second quarter of 2021 from its sales to Microsoft.

However, you can see huge potential is there for Saddle Ranch Media share holders, one thing you should also note is that Saddle Ranch Media now fully owns Tri Cascade, ownership was transferred from SkyFidelity to Saddle Ranch Media. This did not impact any revenue.

SRMX powering Qualcomm (QCOM)

Tri Cascade’s 5G M.2 module will power Qualcomm. The microchip is a 2nd generation 5G modem with integrated multi-mode support, designed to deliver breakthrough wireless performance and accelerate the global 5G rollout.

Saddle Ranch Media SRMX Microsoft MSFT Qualcomm QCOM
TRITOM 5G Modem supports virtually any combination of spectrum bands and/or modes: 5G mmWave and sub-6 GHz, standalone and non-standalone modes, TDD and FDD, spectrum sharing, LTE and legacy modes (3G, 2G). This is designed to enable OEMs to bring blazing fast connected devices to global networks in nearly any form factor.

The connectorized TRITOM module will enable original equipment manufacturers and system integrators requiring the highest possible speeds to deploy 5G on their mobile computing, networking and IoT platforms worldwide.

SRMX powering Microsoft (MSFT)

The TRITOM Azure Sphere Guardian S100 is built with Microsoft Azure Sphere-certified chip and includes built-in Microsoft security technology to provide connectivity and a dependable hardware-based root of trust.

552,2021-05-18,nfc46d,pennystocks,"Xigem Technologies issued a huge report that sums up the global state of remote work.  It's not just about $XIGM - it's a look on the whole gigantic global industry (which I can relate to, working from the couch for over a year now).

# Here are the key takeaways:

>**89%** of respondents worldwide now prefer to work from home at least occasionally. The preference was strongest among digital and knowledge-based workers, among whom 70% have worked remotely.

>**68%** of U.S. workers believe a hybrid workplace model allowing at least one day of remote work per week is ideal

Source: [https://news.prudential.com/increasingly-workers-expect-pandemic-workplace-adaptations-to-stick.htm](https://news.prudential.com/increasingly-workers-expect-pandemic-workplace-adaptations-to-stick.htm)

Another one from the same research:

>**42%** say they will look for a new job if their current company does not continue to offer remote work options

The number in this study doesn't correlate with my previous research, tbh. A different study by EY shows that **over 50% of workers would look for a new job if they can't work from home at least sometimes.** [https://www.ey.com/en\_gl/news/2021/05/more-than-half-of-employees-globally-would-quit-their-jobs-if-not-provided-post-pandemic-flexibility-ey-survey-finds](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/news/2021/05/more-than-half-of-employees-globally-would-quit-their-jobs-if-not-provided-post-pandemic-flexibility-ey-survey-finds)

**In addition:**

>**60%** of companies will offer a hybrid work model allowing people to split their work between the office and home.\[4\]

Large companies seem to adapt to the situation as well. These guys now offer flexible hybrid work options, according to the report:

* Ford;
* Facebook;
* Microsoft;
* Oracle;
* Shopify.

Now where's Xigem in this? Why did they even bother to make a report? Of course, here they are:

>**The shift towards working from home will lift productivity in the U.S. economy by 5%, mostly due to savings in commuting time, and also driven by the rapid adoption of new technology.**

Source: [National Bureau of Economic Research poll](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/yes-working-from-home-makes-you-more-productive-study-finds)

""There is no question that the way in which people work has experienced a fundamental shift, and that **businesses and organizations have adapted to the new realities by employing technology to support their growth**,"" said Brian Kalish, co-founder and CEO of Xigem Technologies. ""iAgent software coupled with our stated objective of aggregating technologies for the remote economy ideally positions Xigem to help organizations manage their teams, customers and clients across geographies and market sectors. We are actively pursuing customer opportunities, and expect that the remote management of human assets will prove to be among the key pillars of our strategy.""

# Conclusion:

Xigem Technologies (CSE: $XIGM) (FSE: $2C1) issued a big report on the remote work economy. The majority of workers feel better at home and are ready to leave their jobs if they'll be forced to get back to office. Xigem wants to dominate the emerging remote economy and works on it, their report definitely represents their interests, but hey - it's still a lot of numbers that sum up the whole industry, not just one company's future.",[],1

With miraculous timing, the FDA releases a statement on Leronlimab yesterday(something the FDA has hardly ever done before regarding an experimental drug...) affirming their position on why no EUA...nearly simultaneously, Adam Fuckstein releases a statement advocating the FDA's position...dirty, just dirty.

Leronlimab covid and HIV trials are soon to take place in Brazil, and covid trials in India. The timing of this statement by the FDA is simply to cover their asses...when the results are in they will have to address congress and explain why they let 400,000 Americans die when they had a drug in their hands that could have made a difference. Keep in mind this drug has zero side-effects, and in fact was used by Charlie Sheen and nearly a thousand others to reduce their HIV infection down to immeasurable levels.",[],0
