Then he sold all of his personal shares. It‚Äôs a bit of a sketchy thing to do after preaching about these things and how great VG is. He gave no advance warning and a really lazy excuse about wanting to invest in climate change and needing capital. Just all around shitty thing.",['SPCE'],0

As it approaches $100 trillion, you'll see a decrease in growth, a decrease in volatility, and it will creating a stable influence in the entire financial system of the 21st century,"" the CEO of MicroStrategy said in an interview earlier this year. 

I think this helps summarize the thinking. This investment group believes Bitcoin adoption will continue to grow up to 100x it's current size.

If you assume they are right about the adoption, then the rest makes sense. When Bitcoin adoption is 10X more than today, the market manipulators are not going to be able to destabilize the coin on a whim as they do now.

Most analysts have believed Bitcoin would reach at least a price of $100k since years ago. Recently it got to around $60k from around $10k last year. It's dropping this week, but anyone that takes this space seriously believes Bitcoin is going to grow a lot more before any real threat to its existence. So that means we are likely to see adoption of many more $trillion, and the price of $100k is still in the horizon and is a fairly sure bet if you do believe the adoption will expand.",[],0

70,gyqpw5m,2021-05-19,t3_nfrvxz,StockMarket,"The Coinbase Pro fees are still very competitive at 0.5% and they have a much more trustworthy vibe than their competitors.

Binance has lower fees but is illegal in the US and it's weirdly difficult to create an actual account on [Binance.US](https://Binance.US). 

Kraken has no easy way to transfer money onto the platform for some bizarre reason. Literally couldn't get my bank to wire them money. Feels scammy.

Gemini fees are ridiculously high unless you use a special version that's not available on mobile.

[Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) doesn't even let you do limit orders. It's just a ""buy"" button, which I assume places a market order at a terrible price. Their high-interest stablecoin and debit card stuff feels scammy.

Webull pretends not to have fees but their buy/ask spread for crypto is insane, so you get horrible prices when you buy or sell. You have to be over 2% up to break even.

I haven't used Robinhood, but I assume they're doing the same thing as Webull and of course neither one will let you transfer your crypto off the platform, so it's not really yours at all.

So the suggestion was this:  You should compare your returns to a broad-market index.  I'd ignore NASDAQ since that is tech-heavy and isn't really a good long-term comparison.   The S&P 500 is fine for large US companies.   The MSCI ACWI Index is another good all-world index too.

But Then we get to ETH. Let's start with the basics of what you can do with ETH. I will try and make this all as basic as I possibly can. If any crypto people are here I'm sorry but I'm going to butcher the hell out of what it can actually do. 



If Bitcoin gets compared to gold. ETH can be compared to the bank. You can buy and store like Bitcoin but you can also create smart contacts to use as leverage against your ETH and do things like borrow money. You could treat the ETH coin like an option and bet on if it will go up or down. You can use ETH to Create NFT'S  Witch Isn't a really well explained concept but It a single token that you could Tie to anything. Phisical. You can Take NFTs and tie them to the sale of a car or your personal computer. It can act as a title to that item. You could use it to track Digital items in games. Nfts could solve the problems with owning something digitally. 



You can also create decentralized apps.So a blockchain is essentially one giant server split up and managed by computers all over the world. It's been neat watching the exchange of money work on the blockchain but what happens when We can start storing Data on the Blockchain. This is where Dapps come in. Imagine if you could have a version of YouTube Where you could upload a video that no one would be able to delete or block or censor. It would never go down you would never see the words YouTube servers are down. 



The word decentralized is thrown around a lot when it comes to crypto. But I want you to ask yourself something. 

If you had to have your personal info stored somewhere online. Who would you trust? I company like Palantir That runs on one set of servers. Or a blockchain? Where you are the only person involved with the storing of your data. You are in charge of who sees it. More importantly you're in charge of who gets access to your data. Imagine a world where your Data doesn't get hacked. Where you don't see news stories of corperations yet again losing your personal info to hackers. Thats what the blockchain is good for. I don't think you can look at tech thats been around for 10 years and call it a scam.",[],0

More adoption = less volatility


But it will take time, trust, and businesses are still a ways from having ' infrastructure ' ready, etc.. but with time we get more coins (ALL FUCKING COINS, EVEN ALTS). More coins = hopefully more wide spread holders and therefore even less volatility etc.


How I see it now especially considering everyone argues against alts because they 'can never beat bitcoin cuz MATH'; I agree and I say alts with lower USD equivalent caps have a better chance of being used often for currency because people will learn ""XYZ coin can never go above $xx.xx"".


Let's say that 'max' is $10.. if I need to buy groceries, I'll 1000000% use my coins that are at $6. can't go over $10 anyways so if it blows up tomorrow I'm not that upset. 


But we all know BTC (or a few others) are often theorized $100k+, 200k+.. that's great but I'm not gonna use a portion of my moonshot tickets for groceries when I have other 'less risky' things.

Consider also how strong the safety rating for Tesla's are. The 2021 models all rate 5 star crash test ratings.

A company with 10 years of R&D, and patent head start. With  products so good they dont need to advertise them on television to be a household name.

That company, is going to be overtaken by older companies who have none of the R&D, and none of the patents.

Its not the engineers. All the engineers specialized in EV production are at Tesla. And a career of building and improving piston engines isnt a background that translates to programming and software design. Most Mechanisms in ICE vehicles are coded into software in EVs by necessity. Theres no gear shift. No steering column, no air intake or exhaust.

Several big analysts think COIN might be a $400-500/share company in the next 12-18 months. It sucks it might take a year for you to recover your initial investment, but that's just the nature of it. Oppenheimer thinks it'll be \~$435/share within the next year or so, but also predicted a lot of volatility, too.

ARKX is an ETF that came out \~market high. The market overall has been down since then, especially with a lot of rotation out of the tech sector into value and consumer companies. Plus, Virgin had a pretty bad earnings, and Cathie removed them from ARKX.  Just look at the holdings. It's good companies.

I bought ARKG several years ago, and even with it being down this year, I'm still up a good deal with it. I dropped some of my IRA money into it at the start of the year, and I'm down like 30% on that. It feels bad, but I'm confidant it'll recover once people start rotating back into tech/cutting edge stuff.

So, ask yourself this....if you were to sell those investments now at a 40% loss, what would you put the money into NOW that would compensate for it?  Would you put it into something safe (VOO/VTI) where you can claw yourself out of the hole in 5 years or would you put it into something really risky to try to make up for it more quickly?

Yes the eBay payments system is much better than being hit with PayPal fees but overall it‚Äôs about the same.

The customer market is also notoriously cheap. It‚Äôs fine to want to pay less for a product, but I would get laughable offers 50% below the going market on some items.

I still primarily sell there but I really dislike how customer centric they have become. I have shipped items that were legitimately lost in the mail because of covid and I was forced to refund the buyers. So I am out the inventory of the item because of a massive delay in shipping where it just gets stuck in a terminal.

Their search algorithm is also bunk. I have set prices to the lowest possible price and every now and then my items would not pop up in searches. I would have friends check with there accounts and they couldn‚Äôt find the item either.
