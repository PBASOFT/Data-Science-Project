Yes, Kashrut = Kosher. 

Kashrut is the law, Kosher is the adjective... Just like ""Halal"" means ""permissible"", not the law itself.

That said,

Now you either follow Kasruth Law to the last word, or you're wasting time practicing ""Partial"" Halal becos you'd get no credit for ""half-hearted"" practice. Its like you can't called yourself a Muslim if you only partially believe in Allah and his private messenger.

I dont even want to talk about these ghost shares that are real or not, that info will reveal itself when the share recount happens and even then thats if management wants to release those numbers. My bet they will release those numbers because its in there best interest to do so. Look at it like this why have a share recount? Why take off 500 million share dilution? Why release 43 million shares in market at market value in such a way that didnt affect price?

Now let me EDUCATE you on how the real world works. In 2019 the corporate tax rate was 21% in the US and 30% in Mexico. The minimum wage was $7.25 in the US and about half of that (on average) in Mexico. Mexico also has far less restrictive labor and environmental regulations than in the US. Now in 2019, Ford announced a plan to invest $900 million to expand operations in Ohio by 2023. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago when Ford announces that it will no longer be expanding operations in Ohio, but will now be spending over $1 billion to build a new plant in Mexico. Just what exactly has changed? The labor costs haven't changed in either country. Could it be the expectation that the Biden Administration is going to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% at a minimum and possibly as high as 35% (which is what half the democratic party wants)?

Who gives a fuck if taxes are considered an ""input cost"" or not? Taxes are a cost PERIOD.

If you do not understand this, you do not understand simple math, general business, or basic economics. This is not a point of debate, it's 100% true and you're simply wrong.

Now I recommend you finish reading that neat little economics book you're quoting out of before trying to post anything else.

However, functionally it would not impart much aside from appeals if there is even an appeal process. Most posts are deleted automatically by bots for not meeting various criteria (I'm not a mod clearly so I don't know any of them). Then there are ones deleted manually after ""breaking rules"" and then those that get deleted for being reported as breaking rules. 

A summary of the biggest issues are as follows: Most posts are deleted by bots. Most posters are shitheads that never took the time to read the rules in the first place. And updating the rules has little impact on those. Anyone who has a post deleted is going to take issue with it and complain. There are 10 million shitheads. Hence the bots. 

If you're like me, you probably read the rules as you are posting. If you aren't like me you'll read the rules once and wouldn't notice a rule change.

Admittedly I made a lot of assumptions here, and I sympathize with you because you are one of few seemingly respectable people in this sub. Updates to the rules is a good policy, but I dont think it would honestly change much.",[],0

The CEO just got in front at the end and people are praising him for doing the only smart thing. AMC will forever be indebted to the people holding the stock and I hope they keep that in mind going forward. AMC wouldn't exist without the holders this spring.

I am taking numbers from MarketWatch:

Over the last 3 years (2017/18/19) the company costs about $4b each year to run (COGS). So, from the start, that is the bare minimum they need to handle each year. During those years they have been clearing over $5b which is good but they only made money once.

Now, what is very relevant (and might have changed) is that as of 2020 they have 616m in short term debt. They also have almost $800m in other liabilities. That puts them at 1.93b in total current liabilities. Next, their long term debt is almost $10b. When you look at the balance sheet they have $12b in total liabilities BEFORE COVID.

With all of these numbers, I am not certain what they have done recently. I have heard they refi'ed some stuff and put some of the recently raised money towards debt. But, I couldn't find anything to see what they have done. If it was a clear cut win I would think there would be some PR from AMC setting out how they are going to handle the debt.

I am not in AMC any more and I do wish you all the luck. I would like to see this turn into a blow up of the hedge funds and their lackeys in the SEC.",['AMC'],0

Saying the mortgage interest credit is keeping the housing prices inflated is like saying the captain pissing his pants is what flooded the Titanic.  Technically it contributes, but on such a small scale it doesn’t make an impact.   

As you mentioned, a huge swath of the population doesn’t even technically pay taxes after numerous deductions.  The few people who take the itemized deductions, and therefore are able to utilize the mortgage interest deduction, are typically reporting enough income, and therefore paying (typically a lot) of taxes.    

In short, OP says the homeowners mortgage interest credit is keeping home prices high by incentivizing large mortgages.    I’m saying virtually no-one benefits from those because only a small set of the population itemizes.  For those that do, State Taxes and Medical Expenses are generally a more relevant decision.",[],0

2218,gyqd5it,2021-05-19,t3_nfn7qe,wallstreetbets,"Huge opportunity; haters gonna hate but here is the bull case:

WISH is not an e-commerce company - they’re a technology company. More than half their revenue is now in logistics and advertising. Wish provides a platform for merchants to sell products from more than just China. They do not make the products; bad products and bad merchants get delisted from the app. 

The average rating across Android and Apple app stores is 4.6 stars - almost 20 million reviews in total. 

They just hired a new executive chair that previously worked at Alibaba and Square. 

Alibaba and Amazon were both previously interested in strategic acquisitions of WISH. 

The company was privately valued at 3x the current market cap. 

The company has more than 50% of their revenue coming from outside the US; Europe is their biggest market currently, but WISH was the number one downloaded app in India for April and is seeing huge growth in Africa. 

They have $1.8 Billion in cash and no debt; they’re not currently trying to be profitable because they’re investing heavily in higher dollar spends for their monthly active users, higher quality monthly active users, logistics and their advertising platform. 

As a short-term trend, the stock has been heavily shorted and e-commerce brands have been rotated away from (see ETSY and POSH as examples); POSH hit a 52w low on the same day. I anticipate this hitting 2x the current price before the end of the year. Building good support at $9 now and small Green Day currently on a bad market Wednesday.",['AAPL'],0

We don’t teach homophobic beliefs. You can perceive them to be whatever you want, but there’s plenty of people from all parts of the gender/sexuality spectrum that would agree with me. 

“The Church distinguishes between same-sex attraction and homosexual behavior. People who experience same-sex attraction or identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual can make and keep covenants with God and fully and worthily participate in the Church. Identifying as gay, lesbian, or bisexual or experiencing same-sex attraction is not a sin and does not prohibit one from participating in the Church, holding callings, or attending the temple.”

“Sexual purity is an essential part of God’s plan for our happiness. Sexual relations are reserved for a man and woman who are married and promise complete loyalty to each other. Sexual relations between a man and woman who are not married, or between people of the same sex, violate one of our Father in Heaven’s most important laws and get in the way of our eternal progress.”

By your logic, God is homophobic. We didn’t just pull these ideas out of nowhere. The family is ordained of God between a man and a woman, and it’s been like that for centuries. I knew two gay men on my mission. One i taught and eventually got baptized. Catholic man, knew of all the policies and ideas taught in the church, never once thought they were homophobic. The other was a lifelong member. Completely celibate. Never thought it was homophobic. 

Shared perception doesn’t equate to truth, but if you spend time looking at it from a Spiritual perspective instead of worldly frustration and mindsets, you’ll actually understand what is going on.",[],0

If it's in regards to the incomplete data sets regarding all shares borrowed by every broker, you're right in that I don't have that, but I CAN look at volume. And then i can make some calculations.

Use common sense for half a second. There are only to possibilities, either the LDS faith is legit, or its all a scam. IF it is legit, then God makes those commandments. And if God made those commandments, who are you to tell Him what he can or cannot do? Are you somehow God's boss? 

And if it's NOT real, then using the internal argument that it's wrong BECAUSE it demands tithing is cyclical and illogical. So either it is all wrong and tithing is thereby wrong by extension, OR, it is all right. It cannot be wrong BECAUSE it asks for tithing because within that premise God is the one asking. 

This isn't a matter of opinion. This is very straight forward logic. 

So calm down and chill out. And once again charity work is not the only function of a church and a reserve fund does not mean it needs to be spent. You have a great deal of audacity to walk into a room and tell a church how to spend their money. What in the world do you actually know about the purpose of that reserve fun? Just because they have money its evil? Seriously, I am beyond reasoning with this level of bias. You are ignoring common sense entirely and are circling back to ""having money is wrong because they're an evil church"" and not addressing why having money is wrong in the first place. 

I get that you have your reasons, but if you're going to engage in dialogue check your childish biases and tantrums at the door and communicate with logic and rational sense. You don't get a free pass because you were hurt by something. Seriously, do not waste my time with spurious statements and arguments.",[],0

My whole point is that they shouldn't be allowed to do that shit at all while claiming tax-exempt status. In fact, I don't think they should even have tax-exempt status in the first place, nor should any religious institution (and that includes *Muslim* religious institutions, since you seem so concerned about them for some reason).

Also, I don't keep track of my charity donations. I donate as much as I can whenever I can, but I don't keep track or claim it on my taxes because I don't donate to get a fucking tax break. I also don't make very much money in the first place, so I donate my time much more than the very limited amount of money that I have. I rescue dogs with health and/or behavioral problems (I currently have four, as well as a rescue cat) and I pay for their extensive medical bills as well as take on whatever special care th y might need. I also volunteer for the local dog park, humane society, and habitat for humanity. I am also active on the Nextdoor app so I can help my neighbors in need whenever I am able to do so. 

Lastly, I never ""overpay"" my taxes. Despite claiming 0 allowances and withholding at higher single rate even though I am married, my husband and I still owe every year. I have no idea why, but like I said I don't make a lot of money so I can't afford the $200-$300 to pay an accountant to look at them, and the internet has been no help. I owe about $700-$900 every year, and I pay it in monthly installments because I can't afford that much money all at once.

During the tech bust the last few months, she shown any shorts or derivatives to profit on the down market. Coinbit to 500,000k is a bit ridiculous, however given its limited supply (21m) and inflationary markets, it could be looked at as a digital commodity which will keep it rising.

Netflix however is a company that I have felt could be in trouble for a while now. Given that anybody that owns content is starting their own streaming service, it doesn’t make sense for them to keep Netflix as a middle man because they offer a currently premium streaming platform. While they do own some of their own content, I feel like it is very hit or miss and that could drive consumers to look at their competitors. While their financial are healthy in the present state, I feel they could fall victim to diminishing margins very quickly. The one wild card for me with Netflix is that they could go out and buy some content through M&A activity that  could make them a player for a longer time.

I love my fam very much and to think that I won't see them again after death was the most bitter pill I've had to swallow with all of this. 

But again, the current LDS church is not involved in these practices today. I fully agree. 

>Secondly, people like to get all high and mighty when they hear we give 10% of our income to the church.

Haha yeah they do. The 10% thing never bothered me much

>that isn't a bad thing, because if times require for action on our part my money will be used in helping others. :)

Eh, not from tithing. You'd need to indicate on your tithing slip that you'd like your money to go to humanitarian aid, but it would *not* count toward your 10%

>Most people think that we abuse and mistreat women like this

Historically the women were abused, but I agree it's overplayed today. These days people are referring to things like women, but not men, having to veil their faces in the temple. Or only men being allowed to be given the priesthood. In 2021, people want to see zero distinction between men and women which I think is stupid. There are differences between genders and I don't see why anyone has an issue embracing that. We're just humans.",[],1

The best part about science is the fact that when we learn something new that goes against something we thought we knew in the past, we change how we think to fit reality around us. Why do the tides go in and out, circa 1000 years ago? Must be gods will. Today? The fucking moon does it.

Because it can't be faked, you cannot spend it twice so you can use it as a currency to facilitate trade and transfer of value. Well the same is true for gold. You can verify by yourself that you hold a genuine peace of gold in a few seconds without any expensive equipment. Actually even more so because bitcoin security relies on the fact that we currently don't know how to perform certain computations efficiently, but we don't have any kind of proof that it is impossible so this might not hold true in the future. And gold properties are dictated by the laws of physics and you can easily measure them by yourself.

You just need to check its weight, dimensions, magnetic properties (it is not not-magnetic, it is actually weakly diamagnetic, so it is repelled by a magnet. It is at the same time an excellent conductor so magnetic field is strongly induced in it) and the sound it makes when hit by something. Yes, it is impractical for everyday use, definitely, but think about it: it's actually quite unique that when you have a strong magnet, a precise weight, a vessel with some water and a smartphone with bullion sound verification app you can make yourself truly 100% sure that that 1 ounce gold coin is really pure gold. Can you be that much certain that a 100 dollar bill is not fake? Not even close. Bitcoin, like I said, you cannot be that certain. Money in you bank account or stock in your Robinhood account?

And halal goes far beyond it not being pork. Even beef and chicken are not halal unless slaughter according to religious law.

And to confuse you even more, anything kosher is halal for muslims to eat. But observing jews cannot eat halal. It has to be kosher.

Now I gotta call you a Jahiliyyah... Christians got an update from God, it's called the New Testament, wherein God say ""All IS Clean Now""... THee may chow down anything... Pork, Lobster, Bloody Shark, Mandarin Duck... Save for the toxic ones, just eat for all food created by me is nutritious.

The only point I make anymore with them is that all HF - combined - have about $3 to $5 trillion to play with, meaning bankrupting all of them occurs below a $5,000 price point. That’s why a $100k floor won’t happen.

But, for the record - $100k is about 60% of global GDP, and about double the entire NYSE.

 Dont get a loan!! What ever you do, think about it, this has you hooked just like the lottery!! Every one keeps buying becuse they know they have a small chance to win.

My suggestion. Find a good long term company and put the cash you have left in there. 

Then dont look at any chart for a year and go find your passion and what makes you happy, and eventually find a job doing what you love.

BTW please never make another decision due to FOMO. It bad I've learned from my own mistakes, I lost 15k from FOMO, so now any time I get the slightest feeling of FOMO I stop and remember what happend last time, and I just forget about the Fomo and move on to somthing else to occupy my mind.
Think of it this way if you have Fomo you got in too late and your not going to make that much any way, and you have to be quick to sell so you dont get stuck, it's just all bad.

-there is absolutely zero way to get more manufacturing capacity within the next two years. Every fab on the planet is pretty much maxed out. Companies and national governments are all investing hundreds of billions in new capacity, but that will take years to bear fruit.

-AMD will still sell every chip they make in that time

-There is money you can spend on architecture R&D, like their cool chiplet shit. But AMD are already spending $1.5B there and that's already up 25% yoy, like how much more gasoline can you throw on that fire.

-AMD's stock has been losing value for absolute bullshit reasons and is at a buy-low point.

They are throwing cash into buybacks because they can't grow sales for any amount of money right now and their stock is legitimately undervalued. I would've looked into acquisitions with that $4B myself, but if you're low and tech is pretty high, I can see why you would bet on yourself.",[],0

I'm looking to increase position to about 50k in shares and 25k in long dated calls. I'm stopping out below 33-34 but this thing will rocket with states starting to adopt online gambling and with sports starting back in full swing this fall.

This will jump to previous highs very quickly, 15B market cap, losing money to pay for advertisements but revenue expectation raised from 900M to 1.15B this year. 13 potential states opening up within the next 2 years to legalized gambling. International bettors hopefully get a piece of the action as well. It's only a matter of time. You'll be kicking yourself in 10 years when this, PENN and others are trading 5x from here.

Also I think the bottom is almost in for growth stocks, we have seen fear and capitulation take over the last 3 months as retail traders bleed themselves out. When you hear about people giving up that's the best time to get back in.

It makes it hard to see the ""request for clarification"" as unbiased. One of the top upvoted posts there this week is literally a crosspost saying ""upvote this [on wallstreetbets]"". Actually, most of them are if you look at it, they just don't all say it so outright.

You know you can't do that, right? I don't report subreddits for brigading, but it's lame. Perhaps you should talk to your community about doing things that are both against Reddit rules and probably more in the realm of 'manipulation' or things that would require legal counsel than anything people dream up as happening here. We can only be so fancy with our spam-fighting methods. It's gonna take down good posts sometimes. I was thinking about making a little custom sidebar widget that lists the last active mods online so they're easier to contact when it gets it wrong.

I'm very much open to hear other sides of the argument, and we aren't actively taught that in church at all. Yes, sometimes we like to tune out the naysayers because we want to focus on what we believe matters, you have a point, but not all of us are completely oblivious and ignorant of the other side of the argument. It is worth noting that I could say the same about you, rehearsing your doubts about the church with other doubters creates confirmation bias as well. Maybe I do have confirmation bias, but we all have biases though, don't we? I will have to disagree that everything you said was factually correct. Polygamy is a touchy subject, and even was for the early Saints. Joseph Smith himself didn't like the idea. 

>The fact is, the Mormon church was created for old perverts to fuck little girls  
Founder Joe Smith would offer church leadership positions to men like Heber C Kimball with young daughters (Helen Mar Kimball; age 14), as long as they'd give their daughters to Smith to have sex with

Do you recall how church leadership positions are appointed? Could you show me some tangible historic evidence that proves this, like Joseph Smith's own journals and writings or something of the sort? And yes, Heber C Kimball had multiple wives, and as far as I know they were not young girls. Even if they were young girls, how would those crimes committed centuries ago prove to the world that our beliefs are false? What is your point? Why was the church created, and why is it bad?

>My man, I've got 34 years in this stuff. Was in charge of missionaries over four US states. Also served a mission myself and eventually had to apologize to all of my converts

What is there to apologize for? 

>Or only men being allowed to be given the priesthood.

What is the priesthood to you? 

>In 2021, people want to see zero distinction between men and women which I think is stupid. There are differences between genders and I don't see why anyone has an issue embracing that. We're just humans.

Could not agree more! I think we have a lot in common. As I reading your message, I'm wondering if the reason why you left the church was because of the struggles that the early Saints had and the bad reputation concerning it?

6690,gyqskxu,2021-05-19,t1_gyqg6zx,wallstreetbets,"Oh boy. This world that we live in has a LONG history of religions that are scams and false. We could have been born in ancient greece following their polytheistic gods. That group faded away with time like thousands of other manmade religions/cults. You were likely (like I was too) born into mormonism. You think THIS TIME it's different? It's just yet another manmade hoax of OUR time. 

How do we know? Look at it objectively. The creator of the group conned people into thinking he could find hidden treasure with stones in a hat, which failed, and he was sent to court over it. He claimed to use this same method (stones in a hat) as he was creating the book of mormon. Why did he con people into thinking he's a treasure hunter? Hmm... maybe he was a conman?   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph\_Smith\_and\_the\_criminal\_justice\_system  


Furthermore, this book that he created has been revealed to be a complete hoax. It's not archaeologically accurate with its depiction of pre-columbian america at all according to any reputable archaelogists (like those at the Smithsonian). No horses or metallurgy existed during that time for example. And no, people didn't ride tapirs into battle. No trace of DNA linking native americans to Israel. The whole book is a sham that is CLEARLY false.   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology\_and\_the\_Book\_of\_Mormon  


He then creates another book (Book of Abraham) that he claimed to translate from egyptian papyrii  (I saw it displayed when I was at BYU) With the rosetta stone, we can now translate those papyrii and it has been revealed that it is not his book and is instead a typical egyptian funeral document called the book of breathings. He did NOT translate that, it was yet another lie.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\_of\_Abraham  


Then you have these ""prophets"" who are supposed to have forward thinking insight from a god. Yet, instead we get extreme outdated hatred, like Brigham Young's racist quote that interracial couples should be slain on the spot. Or that black people are cursed by being less valiant in the pre-existence. Taught for 100+ years and it took them decades after the civil rights movement to alter their views... this is the opposite of ""inspired"". And now they are doing the same with gay marriage while the rest of the world is more progressive. They'll change that in time too, after everyone else. Not inspired.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\_people\_and\_Mormonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people_and_Mormonism)  


I only mentioned 5% of the things that reveal this is a hoax. How much do you need? Logically and empirically, this is a hoax. Now, not only this, but they are requiring 10% of member incomes to STAY WITH THEIR FAMILIES IN THE AFTERLIFE.

Trading stocks is actually quite easy. Its making money while trading stocks that is difficult. I would consider opening an online brokerage account (I use Etrade), and giving paper trading a try, which is basically trading stocks with pretend money. That way, you get a feel for trading stocks without losing (or making) money. Its a good way to learn the ropes and how the mechanics of online stock trading. 

Once you know how to buy/sell stocks, the next step is figuring out which stocks to buy/sell. Thats where your own due diligence and research comes into play. There are some really good books on this topic, but the goal is to identify a stock you think will go up sometime in the near future. For me, I just read as much as I can about a company; what do they do, how they do it, what industry, are they doing something no one else is doing, or doing it in a different/way, etc. Then buy some shares, maybe a small amount at first, and just see what happens.

What's their charitable percentage then? You probably don't know (they won't tell you) and/or you have to admit it's likely very low compared to their net gains. That's the point. It's a mega corporation masquerading as a charity/religion. 

>The church has pretty clear political neutrality policies

Except when it has ""religious implications"" as you said, which is when they decide to step in and exert their influence. That's exactly what I'm talking about. They are still exerting their influence on politics. They shouldn't be putting money towards anti-gay-marriage propositions. They shouldn't be sending letters to all their members saying their position on medicinal marijuana while having billions invested in big pharma companies. You are biased, which means you likely will not consider this objectively, but perhaps you can open your mind enough to see that is wrong.   
 

>If you think 501(3)(c) should be done away with and churches taxed, that's fine as an opinion

Yes, I am indeed saying that a mega corporation pretending to be a religion should be taxed like an MLM that it is. 

Furthermore, of course I have a ""sore spot""? I, like many, spent my childhood being lied to. I had to go to BYU to find out many parts of mormon history and theology I was never told. I was brought up on milk rather than meat. The whole thing is an absolute sham, a collection of harmful lies, not unlike their earlier racist teachings. Imagine me being left out of my sister's wedding simply because I'm not a member of their group. Or to see people being conned into giving 10% of their income to a mega billion dollar corporation while they struggle to get by. No, this group is absolutely a cult (now a mega corporation) and I'm here to speak out against it. I hope you wake up like many of us have.",[],1

Inflation is always... ALWAYS the bogeyman, but remember the chatter about it always spikes when there is a definate movement towards raising the minimum wage. This doomsday scenario never comes.  


The only real issue is social instability and global conflict points flaring up (Middle East, US Race Relations, Russia, China) that would really spook the markets.

After pointing these out you simply ignore them and rant about something else. I am not here for you to shout your personal biases and hatred towards the LDS faith.

For example:
'This world that we live in has a LONG history of religions that are scams and false. We could have been born in ancient greece following their polytheistic gods. That group faded away with time like thousands of other manmade religions/cults. You were likely (like I was too) born into mormonism. You think THIS TIME it's different? It's just yet another manmade hoax of OUR time.""

First of all, you don't know anything about my current or past beliefs. You know absolutely nothing. 

The existence of past hoaxes is not grounds to conclude that this is currently a hoax. It's this kind of fallacy that is annoying. Again I am not here to debate the nitty gritty despite the fact that our knowledge of the events may different. And just because one person you knew said something about Tapir's doesn't represent anyone else. This is the first time I've ever heard that used. 

I have addressed the fallacies you spouted and have held to my stance that I am not here to debate religion, only to address said fallacies. Rant your arguments in another direction because I have no issue with you believing what you do.",[],0

Not true at all, they hide their history under the rug an extensive amount. 

As a member growing up, I remember seeing all these depictions of Joseph Smith ""translating"" the book of mormon with the plates set in front of him. Little did I know until I was at BYU that he actually shoved his head in a top hat to look at some stones with the plates being nowhere in sight (because they didn't exist) the same method he used to con people into thinking he could find treasure and was taken to court over.

Seer stones had their utility, but so was having the plates in front. Emma recounted the procedure, as did other scribes. At times there was a curtain and at times there was not. You take one isolated account and replace all others with it. Multiple other people signed their witness statements of the official presentation of the plates. You just inventing this notion that just because there was a seer stone used that the plates were never translated in other ways is a fallacious conclusion. Everything you say is full of fallacy. It is obnoxious. 

And you not being taught something doesn't mean it's hidden. It's all there for anyone who looks, but you don't learn about the rape of native americans in 3rd grade either. Some things require maturity to approach. It's not some giant conspiracy to quell the man. 

If you really were raised LDS then you know as well as any how much people manipulate and twist truths to make them seem awful. This is no different man. You should know better how to process rational thought if you really claim to be so woke. 

Now let me make this point VERY clear. I am not here to debate religion, only to address the fallacy in your claims. You have moved the goal posts SO many times that now you're here ranting about seer stones. I have absolutely zero interest in continuing this conversation since like I said, you are free to believe what you want.

Sure, if it's real, this god could require many things. It could require I sacrifice my children to get to heaven. It could absolutely be as messed up as you can imagine. You're taking the viewpoint that it's okay no matter what. I would argue that a god that does this isn't worthy of my worship, even if it's real. And here, a god that separates families and taxes the entrance to heaven isn't worthy of my worship. Punishing me for standing up for what's right would be wrong as well. I will not bow to this god. 

&#x200B;

>And if it's NOT real, then using the internal argument that it's wrong BECAUSE it demands tithing is cyclical and illogical. So either it is all wrong and tithing is thereby wrong by extension, OR, it is all right. It cannot be wrong BECAUSE it asks for tithing because within that premise God is the one asking.

You don't seem to be able to grasp the perspective of someone that doesn't believe in your religion. If it's NOT real, I'm being critical of the LDS org, not your fake god. They are then a mega corporation that is setting up goalpost requirements to attain a made up fantasy that they made up.

That was the proverbial canary in the coal mine. There are people in high places talking about more public events being cancelled. There is talk about all airline traffic being halted. Boomers make these big decisions, and are the most afraid right now. The dip is not over... not even close.

Trump is the only one who is keeping this market from doing a full, environmentally unfriendly, 10 gallon per flush spiral down the shitter tube. I'm sure that once one of his advisors tells him that you can make money when the market goes down, all stops are off.

How can we take advantage of this? Well, we help give the boomers the nudge they need (they're hesitant to flush the money they need for their 4th rental property - but they'll do it, if it means getting to live to see millennials get ass fucked by the impending climate crisis).

SO:

    If you're not sick, cough in public. Make sniffle noises. Tell people in the grocery store that something has you under the weather, but you're just not sure what. Remind them that you have to go to work because you live paycheck to paycheck and don't want to be kicked out of your 1br apartment. Touch the produce in front of them (wash your hands after - don't be stupid about this).

    If you ARE sick, touch door handles. Make sure to do a little nose wipe beforehand. Touch common surfaces at your workplace. Go to some sporting events, and make sure to pay with the credit card you've been using to cut your dark web Chinese blow.

    BUY MOTHERFUCKING PUTS. Stop trying to call the bottom. A fucking national catastrophe is NOT priced in, from a dip that only took us back to October.

So, first of all, UWMC was not actually my first DD... Salesforce was. You can see it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx3sbz/dd\_salesforce\_due\_diligence/ , and it was over two months ago.

Second, my very first DD on UWMC was in light of its first runup, and was found here. I did not cross post to the UWMC shareholder thread. as I wasn't aware of it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9frpz/enough\_with\_the\_techno\_mumbo\_jumbo\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9frpz/enough_with_the_techno_mumbo_jumbo_a/)

My second DD wasn't either and was posted solely to WSB (as was the accompanying YOLO): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/md3080/uwmc\_follow\_through\_the\_mad\_money\_interview/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/md3080/uwmc_follow_through_the_mad_money_interview/) 

It wasn't until my third DD that I cross-posted for the first time in UWMC, which was a month later: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mpqxbf/my\_update\_on\_uwmc\_the\_equivalent\_of\_counting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mpqxbf/my_update_on_uwmc_the_equivalent_of_counting/) 

This DD is somewhere in the middle of all my DD, but i also didn't cross post it.: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n605e7/upcoming\_uwmc\_earnings\_in\_relation\_to\_ldi\_rkt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n605e7/upcoming_uwmc_earnings_in_relation_to_ldi_rkt/) 

WSB actually removed a few of my DD posts, such as this one here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzeurb/update\_on\_uwmc\_earnings\_date\_announced\_and\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzeurb/update_on_uwmc_earnings_date_announced_and_the/) 

This one here (Which i didn't want to bother you on): [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n00btl/uwmc\_a\_fundamental\_analysis\_of\_why\_this\_stock\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n00btl/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) 

This one here too: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzey12/uwmc\_the\_electric\_bugaloo\_or\_why\_the\_cleric\_cast/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzey12/uwmc_the_electric_bugaloo_or_why_the_cleric_cast/) 

I could go on, but I belabor the point. I'm just going to use these as a factual basis to speak to my underlying state of mind.

1) I am speaking in the UWMC shareholder area because I am literally all in on UWMC, as   
 I stated I would be in my first or second DD. There's no other stock to talk about, because I'm not diversified. I would fucking LOVE to post about Xillinx. The ability to buy AMD at a roughly 28 P/E ratio when it's cash flow positive, and makes a large sum of net income, and is still growing a huge amount? Fuck yeah. Or GE... Fuck man, i want to talk to people about my plan to sell long dated puts on GME because of the extremely juicy premium. But I cant until i exit UWMC and diversify once more. It's simple. I'm all in. Is it strange that if i'm all in on something, that's the stock i care about? DFV posted about GME for -2- years because he was -all in- on GME. It's like asking an ape to be interested in oranges, when he only eats banana's. 

2) Furthermore, especially when WSB auto removed my DD, i'm going to post elsewhere (I don't want to force my posts where it's getting removed, because i don't want to get banned and i want to follow your ruleset). You can see the deleted posts. You can SEE that it's roughly 6-10 pages worth of research with strong citations. I spend hours on it. It's GOOD research, that is thoroughly vetted by sources like the Mortgage Bankers Association, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and official economic data. I do that, because citations are a strong way to prove that you're not pumping and dumping, or manipulating the stock. I do this as a means of showing to you, and to people who read it, that i'm not talking out of my ass, because i'm not.

3) Flowing from 2, this stock offered a bit more than 6.4% in dividends, which in light of T reducing its dividend to the low 4% range, means that this stock for a time was the highest reliable dividend stock. Especially when considering it's extremely low payout ratio. I'm just trying to state something here, which is that my recommendation of this stock is rooted in fact and not a pump and dump through manipulation. 

4) I didn't make that subreddit, nor am I a moderator for that subreddit. I do post there, but come on man, there was a lot of people hating on me here for a time because ""This stock sucks."" Much like they did for DFV. I didn't want to over impose here, by continuously posting about the ticker and getting bashed for it. One, because it's rude. Two, because it can get demoralizing. People are NOW seeing the stock favorably, much like they do GME. But like GME, UWMC got a lot of shit before their moment in the sun. I AM sorry if you felt like i've been brigading, but i'm OG on this stock man. I posted way before all that, and way before joining the UWMC subreddit. I'm one of the few people you can actually VERIFIABLY see was posting about this stock here from a little more than -2- months ago.

I understand in light of GME, you have applied a lot more scrutiny. Which is your right. And i can understand why you think I'm ""weird"" about this stock. I DO hope that this explanation clarifies and puts your mind at ease. 

In regards to the manipulation:

1) Stocktwits, CNBC, and a host of other personalities would get in trouble before I did. What I am doing is more akin to being a stock analyst, but actually being invested in the stock. Which is why I disclose my positions every time I post my DD, much like contributrs who write articles on SeekingAlpha or Morningstar. I also sauce my shit. I wasn't trying to have a go at the staff team about your ruleset, i was asking you guys to make your guidelines clearer so that I don't fall afoul of them. I'd rather abide by your guidelines, than break them, so help me do that man. Sincerely, that's what this is about.

Speaking of which, this is a literal 1 hour ago example of what i'm talking about in this recent DD: [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ngckdk/uwmc\_relative\_rotation/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ngckdk/uwmc_relative_rotation/)

Fannypackphantom (a mod) stated this: ""Stretch these updates out to two weeks or one if major changes happen, and do not delete the posts you posted to this sub.""

However, that's not in the DD ruleset. If i hadn't read this DD i would never have known my man. That's something to think about. No one who hasn't read that DD knows that. This and the one YOLO forever on your position (even if you add to it), means that i'm stepping on toes/landmines that i'd rather not you know?

Regardless, in closing I'd like to reiterate this. I was posting about UWMC here before I ever found out about the subreddit for UWMC and was invited there because of my DD on it. I post there because I have no positions in other stocks at current, and because my DD is about the stock. I post my DD to more than one place because i put a LOT of effort and time into my due diligence and even if people don't invest in the stock, it's nice to have a talk about it. I LIKE the stock after all. I post it elsewhere, especially, when it's blocked from posting here because i'd rather SOMEONE read what i spent hours of my life creating rather than no one. At the end of the day, I see WSB as an informal investment club. Finally, before posting on UWMC, I posted on another ticket (Salesforce). 

I do really appreciate you doing what you can in regards to the bot, and i appreciate that you took time outside of your day to reply to me. Hopefully, i've eased your mind somewhat as to my ""weirdness."" I apologize if you felt like you've felt brigaded.","['GE', 'GME']",0

To tell me that my experience was UTTER NONSENSE? I was NEVER TAUGHT about the stones in a hat. I was never shown that. I was never taught that Brigham Young said interracial couples should be slain on the spot. I was never taught that the Book of Abraham was derived from papyrii that are actually translated to be an egyptian funeral document. I was NEVER taught that Joseph Smith married other men's wives or young teens. I was NEVER taught about the mountain meadows massacre. I was NEVER taught about 1990 temple ceremony changes. I was NEVER taught about the 1978 racist teaching changes. I was NEVER taught that Joseph Smith was a treasure seeking conman before he started his cult.

IF the LDS church is truly lead by God, then you can be assured that commandments that come from God also come from someone who is all knowing, all loving, and all powerful. Which means that even if you don't understand everything now, rest assured it is with our best interests in mind. If you genuinely think that you are smarter and more compassionate than such a being, then you are simply delusional. You have to operate within the frameworks of established premises. You can't just merge premises to make convoluted arguments. 

What's that scripture? ""When they are learned they think they are wise?"" Who knew there was someone on earth who was smarter than God? That's an amazing find. Your parents must be so proud.

And no, who in the world said what my religion was? Don't condescend to me. And no I didn't fail to grasp it, you were making your point with a fallacious argument and I addressed exactly that. You can reread if you do not recall it.

In the interest of being constructive, your flair rules are kind of your content guidelines for making a post with that flair. Memetron stated that you can only post 1 YOLO and then close out that yolo with a gain/loss. I added like 25k to my Yolo when I posted the update, and that update was like... I need to check but like a month or a month and a half old? Maybe if you add to your YOLO position by a certain position, and enough time has been added, it can be allowed? Think of it like someone telling the world ""I've fucking doubled the fuck down, i'm king of the hill baby, mama didn't raise no bitch!"" Otherwise, just codify what Memetron told me, because people don't know it, or whatever the mods ultimately decide.

I actually agree with what Fannypackphantom said. I think 2 weeks for an update if nothing major happens, and 1 week for if something MAJOR happens is just fine. 

More generally, there's a lot of unwritten rules that people only find out about until after they've unwittingly broken that unknown rule.

Even things like Mountain Meadows and McKonkie's ""mormon doctrine."" 

The reason why I don't argue about it is because eventually I realized never in the history of the world has a faith based decision been made because someone argued nitty gritty. Yes I can place all of these historical events in context. Yes I can denounce improper behavior. Yes I can place all of that within a logically plausible framework where nothing is contradicting. But there will never be an end to it and there is no limit to how much someone can argue twisted things. 

Thats why I came in to address just the fallacies he made regarding ""they have money therefore they're evil"" and fell down this rabbit hole. My stating that I don't want to argue nitty gritty is because it only breeds argumentative feelings and never contributes to anything constructive. It literally NEVER ends. 

You're free to say all religion is bulls***, but if you say all religion is bulls*** because rabbits are cute, then yea Imma jump all over you to call you out on your fallacy.

For example, I had a question about the situation in Israel that I wanted to direct at my fellow german people. There arent many german subs you could ask this question in. I posted it in the only sub I know this topic would fit into and used the „Question / Discussion“ flair. It was a well written and long post with an objective question, not really taking sides. It was deleted because of „low-quality“. Even some commenters said, they didnt understand why this was supposed to be low quality.
The moderator actually answered to it and moved the goalpost, saying it was because there are news articles about it and I was only allowed to write about the topic there. There were 3 news articles about it, the youngest one 6 hours old with hundreds of comments. Neither the news articles, nor any of the comments were even remotely going into the direction of my question. I intentionally didnt write it there, because an article with hundreds of comments is basically dead when it comes to new comments, because no one scrolls down that far. As expected, when I posted it there, because the moderator said so, no one answered.
So basically he made it impossible to discuss this topic on the sub with my countrymen, as long as im not lucky enough to spot an article about this within the first 30 minutes of its creation.
The mod said „What if everybody makes a post about it?“, Ignoring the fact no one yet did and that every wednesday the sub is flooded with individual „Its Wednesday my dudes“-Frog-Memes ,and they dont give a shit at all.
