19,gytfqd4,2021-05-20,t3_ngcedr,stocks,"The bottom line is this: in no other time in human history has the average man had such access to his money. He can move everything he owns at the push of a button. Previously there was a broker who had to input the order and, while I am NOT supporting brokers, they did have a stabilizing effect on the market.

""Are you sure you want to do this.. here's why I think it's a bad idea"" etc.

Now, the average man works. A lot. He wants a piece of the pie but he's working so much (or he's just lazy) he refuses or doesn't have time to actually learn why things have value. The ""fundamentals"". So, what does this leave him to make his decisions with?

Emotion (aka ""marketing""). He has nothing else to base his decisions on.

 Ex: I held my Bitcoin through all the movements from 2011 and through yesterday (still have them today) because I learned the tech and knew it was going somewhere. I also sold my doge the first time elon talked about it and it spiked because I also knew it was a joke and shouldn't go anywhere long term.

If you learn, you can weather the ups and downs. You know what's going on, you know why it has value, you know why you should own it. You'll hold through anything.

I tried explaining why someone on Facebook should teach their kid how to pick things based on management, fundamentals and usability and got told, literally, ""piss off boomer"" by someone else in the thread. It's an eye opener to where the market is headed.

Now, long term, like 20 years down the road, I worry this will affect the markets as the young guys who get burned now are going to be market shy later. That's money that won't flow in to the market because they'll blame the market for their losses and not themselves and their lack of knowledge. Since I'm 43 and not actually a boomer, this will affect me as well (at least I hope :) ). We'll see how this plays out I guess.",[],0

There are two types of stop orders- **Stop limit** and **stop market**. In the first, you set a stop loss and a limit order. So, if prices trade between the two, your order gets executed.

In general, while I’ve been a saver and traditionally make entry investments in stonks that suffer a downside event, I’m leaning towards less dependence on placing money w/ Wall Street and more investment in myself, family & others in my community.  For example, I’ve made the conscious effort to avoid “convenience” factor like buying from AMZN and instead shopping at our local stores.  It requires a little more effort & maybe a little more $$ at risk but the payoff is much more rewarding.  In the same way, It’s convenient to put money in an etf, mutual fund or stock.  Yet the result of this is more fraud, deceit and abuse.  One issue is my wife is a financial advisor and while I earned a CFA which helps me speak to subject, she doesn’t see what I see. Perhaps I should stop playing “this game” of measuring my myself by my stock portfolio or bank account.

208,gytn0k2,2021-05-20,t3_nh0jrk,stocks,"So a lot of people seem to be asking for an investment strategy.  
Such a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.  
My strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.  
How to use it?  
Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.  
Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).  
Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line  
Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line  
No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line  
Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).  
You can see example entries here: https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/  
This strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!  
This is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  
a) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  
b) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them  
This should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).  
If you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media. Just do your thing.",[],0

If a decision needs to be made to buy food or equities, I think we both know where the $ end up. The OP was asking if inflation would result in equity prices rising. There's no universal causal link there. 

Technically speaking equity prices are linked to current profitability and perceived future profitability (earnings growth). Inflation does not drive up earnings. It drives up Revenue and Costs. Not at the same rate, but eventually it levels out. Otherwise, we'd have infinitely profitable companies after decades of inflation....which we don't.

If management compensation is based on company share price, they can influence it by sending out a one time special dividend which might lead investors to think it’s a positive signal by mgmt, etc. 

If the company has excess cash, and has no other uses for it, then a special dividend also isn’t necessarily good or bad. Personally, I would rather companies focus more on looking for acquisitions, or re-investing into R&D or CapEx to drive growth. I also do know that it’s not realistic to always find these opportunities hence, it’s neither a good or a bad thing. 

I don’t know much about the company you mentioned, but check the financial statements of the company and see if it makes sense for them to be issuing this one time dividend.

If you have maxed out 401K matching then ESPP is beneficial because employer is still giving you a bonus of 12.75% of what you contribute to the company stock. 

Now for you selling ASAP. You are increasing your short-term g/l and that’s bad especially when you are accumulating more shares.

This whole inflation narrative is a red herring. The fed has all of the room in the world to get rid of inflation just by manipulating the bond markets.

658,gyu3scw,2021-05-20,t1_gysh1r2,stocks,"They haven't been booking solid profits (relative to their operational costs vs. sales prices) in recent quarters, for various reasons. 

Through their first years of production, they had a take or pay agreement with Glencore, a pretty massive mining conglomerate that took a healthy cut of their sales. (New miners make these agreements before they open because it makes it possible to achieve reasonable financing.) That expired after Q2 last year I think, so the direct effect of that should be almost done with their results, trailing PE-wise--except that it meant they had to start their own proprietary sales team to move the product themselves, and that they had to build up an inventory of product in the markets they sell to, which took some months. They figure to make a higher profit this way in the long run, but it has impacted the past year. 

Also, in Q1 this year they upgraded some of their processing equipment, which should let them produce more of their end product (V2O5) every quarter, but they had to stop production for a few weeks to do it.

Price should also be high relative to past 12 earnings because the price of the product is up relative to these past four quarters, with V2O5 now around $8/lb vs. around $5/lb over 2020. (In general, mining stocks are interestingly leveraged to the underlying product... Largo makes V2O5 for like $3/lb, so at $5/lb they make $2. At $8/lb they make $5... 150% increase in the profits because of a 60% increase in the underlying price.)

The solution is to slow exchanges the fuck down, like engine governors in NASCAR.  The solution is to tax the shit out of people who hold positions for 5ms.  The solution is a penalty box for people who gamify the system and front run.  But don't hold your breath.

994,gyueldb,2021-05-20,t3_nh02hb,stocks,"If a company has excess cash, they can reinvest in the company, or pay shareholders. In an ideal world, if $1 of reinvestment creates $1 or more of company value, it should be reinvested. Otherwise it should be distributed to shareholders.

Which would you rather own a stock of? A company with $1M in equipment or a company with the same $1M in equipment but with a 1/100 chance of issuing a huge dividend each year? Obviously you'd rather have the one with the dividend. So you'd potentially be willing to pay a small premium (increase in share price) for the one with the dividend.",[],0
