The next supply squeeze that may take markets by surprise isn’t lithium. It isn’t even a battery metal …

While everyone is distracted by the media barrage surrounding EVs, another commodity may be creating an investment opportunity to rival all …

We think it’s potentially bigger than the cannabis boom that reportedly netted some investors 1,000% gains.

It’s helium.

And some experts say we’re running out of it.

It’s not just a niche commodity anymore. It’s not just about balloons. And we think it’s positioned to become the focus of increased investor interest.  

Like oil and gas, this is about exploration, discovery, and development. And we think the biggest returns may end up coming from the small-cap explorers trying to hit the big time with a new discovery - all on their own.

*Growing Helium Demand*

Demand for helium is increasing, and it’s coming from multiple sectors, including everything from the tech and biomedical industries, to space, medical equipment and national security. And, yes, of course, party balloons and Thanksgiving Day parades.

Many industries require helium.

It’s been reported that the tech industry has been a massive catalyst, and that 2013 was a game-changing year for helium supply.

That’s when the world’s first ‘helium drives’ were made commercially available, making helium a key ingredient to fill our monstrous appetite for data.

Some 3.7 billion people are generating some 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every single day. And even those numbers may grow by up to 60% a year. By 2025, it is projected to be more like 160 zettabytes per year. Helium drives were apparently a breakthrough that replaced the air in hard drives with helium to reduce the energy used. They went from concept to commercialization in 2013.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)--all are said to need tons of it for their massive data centers.

We think demand is set to surge into the helium-driven territory of zettabytes.

And the growing semiconductor market may depend on helium, too. Why? Because helium can bring temperatures down to below -450 degrees Fahrenheit--lower even than liquid nitrogen. This is important for superconducting equipment in particle accelerators and the magnets used to build semiconductors, according to Forbes.

Driving this further is a global computer chip shortage.

In Geneva, Switzerland, the Large Haldron Collider (LHC), the largest high-energy particle accelerator on Earth--and the biggest machine in the world, needs a truckload of helium every week.

Nor does the demand story end there …

The health sector is another major driver of helium demand. It’s also critical for use in cooling magnets in MRI machines. Without helium, we won’t have working MRIs. The shortage also threatens NMRs--nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which in turn is a crucial aspect of medical research.

I vaguely remember reading somewhere that the limit buy doesn't move the needle. Can someone give a quick breakdown of how I either helped or hurt the stock today? 

If you can't tell, smooth brain here. And I recognize that more volume than 5 shares is necessary to make an impact but the concept should still be the same.

90,2021-05-19,StockMarket,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 19, 2021**

The stock market opened deep in the red but managed to climb throughout the session to pare much of the losses. For example, the Nasdaq (QQQ) opened 1.73% down but managed to close the day 0.12% up. Despite the market declining modestly the last three days, it is encouraging to see volatility decreasing this week  after the wild swings the market experienced in the last few weeks. As said before, I thought the initial sell-off after the April Consumer Price Index was released was overblown for several reasons and am encouraged by this week’s price action.  

Leadership in equity markets has see-sawed between cyclical and value stocks and technology stocks, as market participants weigh the prospects for a strong economic rebound as the US economy continues to reopen with the possibility that the pick-up in activity may generate a surge in inflation. After leading the market higher in April, in the last month, the Nasdaq is down 4.77% compared to 0.79% down in the S&P 500. In my view, this dip could represent a great opportunity given earnings have been extremely strong and many companies have significantly raised guidance moving forward. 

The Federal Reserve released its April Meeting Minutes (basically a written record of what happened in the meeting), which said that “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals” and reiterated, for like the millionth time, that they did not believe a near-term adjustment of monetary policy was needed. Much of the recent volatility in the market is due to investors afraid that a surge in inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, so hopefully this commentary by the Fed can calm things down. [Read the entire meeting minutes here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210428.pdf)

However, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Fed’s argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Fed’s view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be “transitory” and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Moreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

**Highlights**

* After declining in recent weeks, the sell-off in cryptocurrencies across the board intensified, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling below $40,000 after the People Bank of China (PBOC) doubled down on it’s stance and released a statement reiterating that digital tokens shouldn’t be used for transactions. The PBOC posted in their official WeChat account, “Virtual currencies should not and cannot be used in the market because they’re not real currencies”. It’s important to note the statement doesn’t have any new regulatory steps, according to Yu Lingqu, a vice director at the China Development Institute think-tank in Shenzhen. 
* Ford Motor (F) is expected to unveil an all-electric version of its bestselling F-150 pickup truck tonight
* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fifth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. 
* Nvidia (NVDA) is extending its cryptocurrency mining limits to newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards. After nerfing the hash rates of the RTX 3060 for its launch in February, Nvidia is now starting to label new cards with a “Lite Hash Rate” or “LHR '' identifier to let potential customers know the cards will be restricted for mining. NVDA offers a separate, specialized mining processor that has the best performance for mining but will not be able to handle graphics. 
* In a Ford factory in Michigan, President Biden promoted his $174 billion plan to promote and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles across the United States and planned to roll-back vehicle emission standards. According to the fact sheet, Biden's plan ""proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States” and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories ""to build advanced vehicles and parts.""
* Michael Burry, the investor famous for calling the 2008 housing market bubble and portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie “The Big Short”, recently unveiled a huge bearish bet on Tesla. Scion Asset Management, Burry’s firm, said in a regulatory filing it had put options on 800,100 shares of Tesla, as of the end of Quarter 1, a value of $534 million. Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they are part of a broader trade are not publicly available.
* Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has sold nearly all of its Wells Fargo (WFC) stock, a position the company has held since 1989. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire said it owned just $26.4 million of shares of WFC as of March 31, down from around $32 billion in January 2018.

&#x200B;

Halfway through 2021, retail investing has reached a peak volume we have never seen before. In fact, the average amount of trades happening each day has more than doubled since 2019. Trillions of dollars are moved as stocks rise and fall throughout the day. However, even though stock prices change at all hours, US retail traders are restricted to the narrow timeframe of 9:30 AM through 4:00 PM EST.

The restrictive trading hours placed upon retail traders is just one of the many issues with the current system. Some of the other problems have been brought to attention due to recent events, such as the meteoric rise of GameStop stock and Dogecoin. In both cases, many different stock brokerages used by retail traders restricted the buying or selling of specific securities, effectively manipulating the market.

Time and time again we have seen larger investment institutions place rules and regulations on ordinary traders, while giving themselves the freedom to do whatever they want. Our goal? Level the playing field.

**Our vision**

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) represents a massive amount of wealth and equity. It has a market cap of 26.2 trillion dollars and is easily the largest stock exchange on the planet. However, if you’re able to freely trade with all the stocks within the NYSE, you’re still only able to trade with roughly a third of the global stocks.

There are dozens of other stock exchanges out there using dozens of different currencies. However, the time-zone and currency differences make accessibility difficult. We see a world where anyone can trade on any stock exchange, regardless of their currency, at any time they wish. At first glance, it may seem idealistic, or a far reach. But in reality? It’s already here.

**What is StockSwap?**

StockSwap is the stock market reimagined, with the power of investing held equally by all parties for the first time in history.

On StockSwap, you can purchase any stock you want, just like on any other platform, but without any of the restrictions.

**How does it work?**

StockSwap is possible through the developments of cryptocurrencies and blockchains over the past several years. When you buy a stock on StockSwap, you are exchanging your money for a wrapped cryptocurrency token that is directly tied to and backed by your desired stock, purchased by us. This means you retain voting rights, receive dividends, and keep any other benefit of directly owning the stock yourself.

**How can I start?**

If everything you’ve read so far sounded appealing, that’s fantastic. But while we’d like our platform to be perfect, we’re not quite there yet. Before you can start trading with us, there’s a few things you should know.

**Where are we now**

As we work towards perfecting StockSwap, all trades have a 1% fee placed on them, capping at $10 to help cover our developmental and maintenance costs. We understand nobody wants to pay money to invest and are working on further reducing those fees as we progress, with our ideal scenario consisting of phasing them out completely in the near future.

In addition, while StockSwap is already developed and fully functional, we are still finishing the process of obtaining our broker dealer license. Before completing this step, SEC regulations require the investment portfolio of any potential client to be greater than 10 million USD. This means, while we’re currently serving several dozen clients, it’ll be at least a few more weeks before we’re able to able to help everybody trade freely.

Until then, keep up to date on our progress through our medium and telegram pages. We can’t wait for you to join us on our journey as we reimagine how we invest.

Until next time!",nghld2,[],0

951,2021-05-20,StockMarket,"Profitability certainly isn't a one way road. If you ask pretty much any profitable trader on their journey, you'd be met by how much money they've  burnt for the sake of learning how to trade; and how you should place special emphasis on planning your positions. Conventional and generic as it may sound, trading the most liquid market on the field of investments actually needs a lot of attention to detail and groundwork.

With so, throughout my experience and journey in the forex market, here is my checklist before I enter a trade.

1. **KNOW YOUR BROKER.**  Yes, you've read that right. Knowing your broker can have a factor on your win rate. You have to know how much spread and leverage they offer--given so, it will help you determine whether your type of trading (Scalping, Swing, or Day Trading) would suit their services. For this, I use [Fazzaco.com](https://Fazzaco.com). They provide in-depth analyses on different FX Brokers. From trust ratings to news and economic datas , they have it all.
2. **KEEP TRACK OF YOUR TRADES.** Jot down your performance. Treat trading like a competitive online game. As much as possible, you would want to be one of the bests--having high win rates and a good stat sheet is one of our goals. To do that, you must be self-aware of your trading history. Trading is more than just making money. Part of it is also keeping records. I highly suggest using myforexbook
3. **CHECK THE FUNDAMENTALS.** Technical Analysis is one thing--personally, I use TA to find the best position to enter a trade. But other than that, my bias would entirely depend on the economic situation and datas the currency has to offer. Again, NEVER NEGLECT YOUR FUNDAMENTALS.
4. **TRUST YOUR ANALYSIS.** One of the many reasons why most traders fail is the tendency to switch bias while in a middle of a trade. Although some harbor success  on these methods, it isn't exactly for everyone. Stick to your plan. Remember, there are only two outcomes in trading. Either you win, or you lose. There is no middle ground.
5. **HAVE A GROWTH PLAN.** Think long-term. If you want to find success in the career of trading, set ideal objectives. It is essential to have daily, weekly, and monthly goals.

Always remember that rules are what distinguishes viability from seasonality. A good trader is built step after step.  Hope you guys find this post useful.",ngrfdh,[],1
