If you've been interested in the stock market from october 2020, seen the incredible climb of those stocks till january/feb then realise that with covid opening up inflation is going to spike as the globe realises manufacturing and production isn't what it was, then you need to assess how and when you take profits and come up with strict guidelines.

Especially when you hear about the big boys like buffet, burry and dalio collecting cash since september 2020. Some of these guys did pre-empt it, Buffet missed a massive bull run on some positions.

62,gz7q3pv,2021-05-23,t3_nji7hv,stocks,"Depends on your goals if you want to continue being 100% specialized in a good stock like AAPL or if you want to diversify to minimize risk while still maintaining some exposure to AAPL through an ETF.

Honestly, AAPL is a pretty safe company to invest in because of their increased dividends, massive profits, and growing subscription services which might warrant their higher P/E. I think AAPL is doing the right fundamental changes to their business like the Apple M1 chip to their Mac products, weareables, and growing streaming services like Apple Music and Apple TV. Sure, they might not be as popular as their competitors but Apple is certainly diversifying their influence across their user base to provide more consistent revenue in the future.

I think AAPL is also objectively a long term hold due to their massive influence in most ETFs like the SPY, DIA, and QQQ. Their massive market cap makes it difficult to swing up or down too quickly and should be a stable long-term hold for investors. The fact that AAPL hasn’t done much since August 2020 is actually bullish given the stock could be ready for a massive move upwards since investors could look for opportunities for more upside from Apple in terms of technicals and fundamentals. I believe AAPL’s financials look extremely strong and any more weakness in the stock price will actually lower their P/E ratio substantially to look like a value play for a growth stock.",['AAPL'],1

146,gz7tb5d,2021-05-23,t3_nj9kk4,stocks,"I think ""smart money"" as a large group is not worth tracking. What I like to look for are specialists. If you are going to do this, you must align your investment period with how the managers invest. You also have to understand if the manager has different types of investment products that invest differently. For example, in biotech, Orbimed Advisors is one of the best in venture biotech. But positions can be in the hedge fund (shorter holding period) or the venture funds (longer holding period). For large, diversified asset managers like Fidelity and TRowe, the 13Fs are useless because they have index funds. You cannot take any real investment opinion away from quarter to quarter changes in holdings. 

It is also important to not just buy the largest holdings. With good managers, the largest holdings have grown into the largest positions through appreciation. You will want to track the new positions and see if the manager is adding to them over time. 

For what this forum is looking for, you want managers with one or two products that invest for the long-term like us. I like the following:

That, combined with the fact the stock is likely to continue to grow, makes it a fairly safe place to store some safety money.

On the downsides, I don't think most people are going to continue to be willing to pay $1000 for smartphones every year when you can get great smartphones for $250 that will last you several years. But people may continue to surprise me.

Also, I feel like I increasingly hear about problems with Apple products that I don't experience with the similar products that cost 1/5 as much. I'm a software.developer and very technical so I don't recommend discounting my opinion there.

I don't see how the M1 chip is going to be a game changer when computers are already much more powerful than people need. The processor is almost never the bottleneck anymore, it is usually the hard drive for most tasks or the graphics card for gaming.

Apple TV by most accounts is lame except for Ted Lasso. Apple Music isn't as good as other options. 

But I've owned Apple since 2003. I have, unfortunately, sold half my shares several times and have made lots of money from it. There is no question it has been an amazing stock but it's continued dominance are far from certain as its current products are in commodity areas now.

275,gz7ymwp,2021-05-24,t1_gz5sdkw,stocks,"Volatility drag is way less scary when you look at it mathematically.  For leverage ratio L, the expected CAGR is Lx - (L^2-1)/2 * stddev^2 where x is the CAGR of the underlying and stddev is essentially the volatility.  So for TQQQ, your expected returns are essentially 3x the returns of QQQ, minus (3^2-1)/2*stddev^2 = 3*QQQ - 4*stddev^2.  The stddev of QQQ over its lifetime is 15.43% and its CAGR is 20.51%, so this formula says TQQQ should return 3*.2051 - 4*.1543^2 = 52.0%.  The actual return of TQQQ is 50.86%, so you can see this formula gets you pretty close[*].  The additional difference is due to the expense ratio and cost of the derivatives they use to implement the fund.

TWO BIG RISKS HERE.

1. In a period of low returns volatility drag does become significant.  Volatility drag scales proportionally to L^2 and volatility^2.  It's been 9.5% per year for TQQQ.  That's been no big deal the past decade, but only because QQQ has returned 20.5%.  Notice that the volatility drag formula does not depend at all on the return.  So if we have a decade where QQQ only returns 5% per year, with the same volatility we've had, TQQQ will only return 5.5% before fees and borrowing costs - so it'll likely do worse than the underlying.
2. A true bear market like 2000 or 2008 (before 3x funds existed) is the biggest risk in my opinion.  This can cause a huge drawdown that takes a decade or more to recover from because you start with such a low baseline.  If you are young, that's fine, in fact it's desirable because you can keep buying at the bottom.  But you'd want to start ramping down your leverage decades in advance of retirement or big purchases like a home downpayment.

Because of these two risks I strongly recommend only holding a fraction of your portfolio in 3x ETF(s).  You can still achieve handsome returns much more safely at something like 1.5x or 2x overall leverage.

[*] Technically this calculation isn't quite correct, since I've used annual CAGR and monthly stddev, I should actually use daily CAGR and daily stddev, then extrapolate to annual return, but this is a close enough approximation.",[],0

>...completely ignoring that even Tesla admits their system is still level 2, and is explicitly not autonomous.

This is often misunderstood. If you dig into it more clearly, they were simply clarifying to regulators that, ""What we call 'Full Self Driving Beta' should be considered as level 2 for liability purposes"". The implied meaning being that, a level 3 or higher system will not be called ""Full Self Driving Beta"". Being the a beta release of the autonomous system, *it should definitely not be considered autonomous for regulatory reasons*. Level 3 is considered autonomous. Once it is out of beta then I would expect it to be level 3 at least, since level 3 is when it starts being considered autonomous.

The autonomy levels are really mostly for liability to determine when it starts to shift from the driver to the manufacturer, so it's very important to clarify exactly when it should be considered as level 3 or higher as that will result in an additional shift of the liability of accidents from the driver to Tesla. This can be looked at as ""Well, it's clearly flawed because they are avoiding getting it classified as level 3"" or ""They simply don't want to deal with the additional liabilities of level 3"", but realistically speaking there are really only two levels of autonomy. Either you need to be prepared to take over (level 4 or less) or you don't. With that in mind, it is best from a lawsuit/liability adverse perspective, to leave it as level 2 (car owner is responsible for accidents) until it's ready to be considered level 5 (manufacturer is responsible for accidents, but is much better than a human, so accidents are far less likely). 

If you look at FSD beta from a technical perspective and review what is considered level 3, then it seems quite clear that FSD Beta is far more accurately classified as level 3 than level 2 in terms of capabilities (stopping at stoplights, making turns, being able to complete drives with little if any interventions), indeed, out of beta it might be closer to level 4 than 3. So why classify it as level 2? Liability as mentioned above, it's wise from a liability avoidance perspective to keep it classified as only level 2 for as long as the regulators will allow or until it's level 5.

I will agree that it's less clear how long it'll take for it to be out of beta, and it has taken a fair while longer than expected to get here. Elon is optimistic that it'll be months (before 2022), but Elon time and all so perhaps more like mid/late 2023. If it's going to be out of beta and thus autonomous, then that would imply a public beta probably within a few months or so.",[],0

I strongly believe it's the later, and I also believe it will probably bite them at some point in the future, quite possibly the California DMV investigation going on. That's going to end not great either way. It's going to either be considered that it should be level 3 and get slapped for specifying level 3, or it's going to be level 2 and get slapped for implying it was higher in advertising.

As for those 3 last words, they were not intended as there is no evidence that I could find that clearly shows that there was actually regulatory pushback against it being considered level 2. The DMV asked Tesla what they wanted it considered as, Tesla said level 2, and now the DMV has some raised eyebrows raised because the naming suggests it should be higher than that. My inclination is they were hedging and referring to it as a level lower than it actually is because beta is intended to be more of a level 2.5, though as I mentioned above, having done that will probably get them into trouble as well. Sigh, the USS TSLA sails some rather choppy seas, thankfully my trading strategy for TSLA makes more money the more volatile it is.

I believe the main reason there has been a sell-off is because they indicated their total dividend would be cut in half after the transaction.

Plus, as a shareholder, you would also receive ~70% of the new company as well. In theory, this may help stimulate growth in the long run while still providing a competitive dividend (I’m guessing ~4-5%).

 We have 2 trials showing success with moderate SNHL currently. The multi dose and age related trials show us those are no good. I suspect the severe hearing loss trial that is currently ongoing won't yield that great of results because when a patient has reached the severe stage of SNHL, they most likely have had enough trauma to the ear that the progenitor cells aren't in that great of shape either so that drug can't really work very well for them to benefit.

When you sell an option, you receive money and acquire an obligation (to buy or sell a particular security within a particular time period).

Here, if OP were to SELL a PUT option, he would get paid money (known as a premium).  In return, he would be obligated to buy whatever particular stock at a particular price within a particular time period.  

Let me give you an example.  I recently sold contracts in $STEM.  The ticker looks like this: -6 STEM 09/17/2021 30.00 P.  

This simply means that I received a premium.  In return, I took on the obligation to buy 600 shares of STEM at $30/share on or before Sept 17.

I have $18k frozen in my account as a result of this (hence, these are “cash-secured puts”).  If I didn’t have cash on hand, these would be “naked puts,” which I wouldn’t recommend.

686,gz8evxa,2021-05-24,t1_gz8ckmg,stocks,"Selling covered calls with 100 share you have implies that you are willing to give someone else the right to buy your shares at a specified target price to be “called away” via exercising the contract.

For example, you hold 100 shares of AAPL with an average cost of $125 right now. Having 100 shares allows you to write these contracts or obligations that you will sell your 100 shares at a higher price and be paid a premium to do so. Let’s say, selling to open a call contract for Apple: AAPL $140 C 6/18 for $0.23. You’ll be instantly credited $23 to your brokerage account.

Running a covered calls strategy is good for stocks that grow in price slowly and stocks that you don’t mind holding forever. AAPL is a great example since it is a dividend, growth stock with strong fundamentals. Ideally (and best case scenario), you don’t want to get your shares called away because you’d rather hold it for the long term and let those call contracts you sold to expire worthless and keep the contract premium.

Worst case scenario, you get assigned your bearish covered call play by being forced to sell your AAPL shares at $140 if the contract expires ITM or gets exercised early. Since you owned your 100 shares at a cost basis of $125 and got forced to sell the shares to the counter party at $140 (the agreed upon strike price of the contract you wrote), you essentially pocketed $1523 of profit. Basically, in a covered call strategy you are capping/limiting your earning upside in the underlying by selling a call option. If you think the stock ran up too much and implied volatility of the stock is high, you can sell a call option with a juicy premium to sell the AAPL shares at the price you want and get paid a premium in the process. Covered calls are good if you do it with a good stock that won’t swing too wildly, meme stocks for instance can quickly wreck your overall portfolio that is exposed to the underlying performance of the stock price. Also, covered calls will start losing you money in potential upside if the stock price moves above your break even price for the call contract ($140.23 in this example). So once AAPL hits above $140.23, that’s when you start missing out on further gains.

So, usually covered calls can be a great way to make some solid income on top of your favorite stocks and ETFs. I didn’t talk too much about the Greeks, this is useful to know if you plan to do a PMCC with a long ITM leap to sell covered calls against it. I wouldn’t recommend it for a beginner since PMCCs will swing harder if the stock trades sideways or downwards and it is also subject to theta decay (contracts lose time value and will eventually expire worthless).",['AAPL'],0

Again, this is not new, ground breaking or even notable. Everyone knows the market favors the rich, the insiders, the hedge funds, the money makers, and on and on. Why do you think so many people ask things like ""Everyone in my life tells me the stock market is for the rich, not guys like me is this true?""

There is just no content on those obscure places even if someone finds them. Grudgingly they will swallow their 4th add in 10 minutes and keep going there, they will get past controversies after controversies and still use them, situation which makes twitch, youtube and likes very rich.

>A streamer can mess up and lose their fans at any time

Not just that, if someone becomes target of cancel culture, whole companies associated with them can become targets too. Small chance of it being relevant one day.

Edit: took a look at financials, by the metrics it should rather be considered a pennystock. Growth they have is very huge, then again i don't know the market, so idk if its the circumstances or the company being amazing, can't make that judgement. They make that growth with debt and offerings dilluting the shares, and they are going to keep doing these 2 things, which makes its quite a gamble if investors by end of the day will be left with money, will beat the market etc.

They are also bringing stars like NFL star Richard Sherman and collaboration with Coldplay. Personally in pennystock world i consider it a big pump when I actively start recognizing the star names being bought. Which means properly timing this stock can become very essential to keeping the wallet intact. Stock price peaked up 500% past year(classic for stocks being mentioned at reddit), that is a lot of growth they still have to deliver on, anyone investing in it better believe the company for real, if the circumstances are not what investors predict, there is a possibility of heavy bags. Opposite is also the same, since its basically a pennystock area, it could go up few hundred % just as easely. A lot more to look into it, not just ''gaming so big'' to make that guess.",[],0

3. Disproportional effect from large moves: as an exponential percentage, large moves have greater effect. Ever hear the term “Price going down takes the elevator, price going up takes the escalator”.  Fear causes more drastic moves to the downside in general than greed causes moves to the upside.

These things are designed to go to zero more or less, once they get low enough, they reverse split so they can continue dropping as fast as the index they’re imitating at leverage.

983,gz8rpw2,2021-05-24,t1_gyo4057,stocks,"I am a big fan of GE with their CEO. Honestly though, he's probably the reason the stock is trading at a relative premium. People sometimes forget that GE does have a little foothold in the wind turbine game and Larry Culp plans on taking advantage of that market. I would not be surprised if they announced some more projects in the next couple years. They usually fly under the radar but can definitely make a difference for investor sentiment because a lot of people still hate GE for how it collapsed a couple years ago, it ruined retirement funds, pensions, you name it. People still probably have a bad tatse in their mouths that only good execution on their turnaround can heal. 

I've mainly played GE since may last year, I bought leaps and calls but no shares until a couple months ago, the market last year was easier to make money on options, so I figured the smart move once January hit would be to cash out and use some profits to buy shares. Im happy I own them, it's probably doomed to trade sideways for a while but once air travel resumes, their GECAS deal will prove to have been a great move. 

It's a long hold and nothing that will break the bank, but in my view, GE is going to double in the next few years. I have an exit price for half of my position but the other half I plan on holding until I see something that gives me a good reason to sell, fundamentals, yada yada. 

I am also a little biased because GE was one of my biggest cash cows last year and thinking that the next couple years will be the same can be a bit shortsighted of me, but I am convicted and will stick to my bet right now as I see it as a safe, slow return on profits I have already secured.",['GE'],0

This would make sense, as they've had to pile on huge amounts of debt to survive.

As a counterpoint to your post, I'd ask you to look at Terry Smith's discussion about investing in airline companies (namely: they're awful, and you never should). Airlines have consistently terrible low returns on capital employed and destroy shareholder value. 

I find his point so compelling that I'd consider any money manager who invests in airlines long-term to be either ignorant or incompetent.

They sat at around 80x P/E before earnings and even with good earnings were still around 58x which was well above the average of the industry. More broadly, if you look at the general growth YoY they didn't really deserve their runup in price over the course of last year. No significant profit increase, no huge acquisitions, etc. Essentially, this stock was due for a correction like many other stocks have experienced in the past few months.

In addition to this, the outlook going forward from these earnings wasn't particularly spectacular so that wasn't encouraging enough for investors to hold their covid period stocks.

All that being said though, I am certain that this stock like many others will see a rebound after the correction finishes its course and around midsummer reach back at its high.
