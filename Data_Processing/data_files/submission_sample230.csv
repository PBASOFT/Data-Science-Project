80,2021-05-20,stocks,"I own a decent amount of shares of FutureFuel Corp ($FF). The company released quarterly earnings reports a few weeks ago and revenue was down quite a bit. This led to the stock dropping about 15%. A day later the company announced they would be paying out a one-time special cash dividend of $2.50 per share. Obviously this is a pretty crazy high amount of money to pay out per share. In response to that announcement, share price rose about 30%.

What confuses me is what benefit a company would gain from doing this? I am not complaining about the payout, but it seems like the timing of the announcement was to offset the poor quarterly earnings report. Why would a company who saw a ~20% drop in revenue choose to make a payment out to shareholders like this?",nh02hb,[],0

523,2021-05-20,stocks,"I have been out of lithium miners since the beginning of this year after I exited my Livent position at what I thought was a peak at ~$20 per share. As I see them rally again I decided to look into more value oriented plays. Although I am a big fan of mining companies currently, I though that lithium miners we're about priced in when it came to forward demand. 

That being said, I have always still kept an eye on stocks such as albemarle and SQM. SQM seems to be at a very good value standpoint right now after they got beat up due to the chilean government transition. I believe at this point the stock is oversold and now is a good time to take a position. The company trades at a relatively high p/e right now, but I believe higher lithium prices and higher quality lithium demand will be a factor in their growth moving forward to 2022 and 2023. 

SQM's long term debt stands at just under $2b, which I do not think is terrible given how much of it was acquired during covid. They are also not a lithium pure play, and have a sizable portion of the market for iodine, which is used in the medical field as well as potassium nitrates for fertilizers. Their main income is definitely from lithium and this will continue to be true.

They have a joint venture in Australia that is supposedly coming online in the middle of this year that is focused on production of lithium hydroxide. This is a risk it seems as SQM has not produced lithium from a hard rock project it seems and this holds execution risk, although I am not worried much about it, it is worth noting. Another risk would be the chilean government altering land agreements and taxes, which is also probably not too much of a worry as lithium is taxed heavily as is. The land agreements even less so because most changes to land would be for private entities, and SQM leases their land from the government. 

All in all, the risk reward on this stock after the sell off seems relatively solid and I have initiated a position and plan to hold/dca down if the opportunity presents. Lithium prices are still quite low and the company doing better will depend on the lithium prices creeping up for the next few years as demand is supposed to increase substantially. 

Albemarle is also a great company, I haven't read up on them too much, but I believe at a quick glance, you could get away with starting a position now and averaging down if the chance presents itself. These are my the 2 companies that I would recommend to actually go long on for lithium mining. The LIT ETF is also good, but I prefer individual stock picking.",nh2yi0,[],1
540,2021-05-20,stocks,"3D Systems Corp. (NASDAQ: DDD) stock surged by 1.7% at the last close while the 3D Systems stock price gains further by 1.06% in the pre-market trading session. 3D Systems, based in Rock Hill, South Carolina, designs, produces, and sells 3D printers, 3D printing products, and 3D scanners, as well as providing a 3D printing facility. Chuck Hull, 3D System’s former president, and CTO invented stereolithography and received a patent for it in 1986.

Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminded plaintiffs on May 17, 2021, that the closing date to file a lead plaintiff petition in the class action brought on behalf of investors who bought or otherwise acquired 3D Systems Corporation shares between May 6, 2020, and March 1, 2021, inclusive (the “Class Period”) was approaching on June 8, 2021

Defendants made knowingly inaccurate and/or misleading claims during the Class Period, according to the lawsuit, and refused to reveal significant adverse information regarding 3D Systems’ industry, activities, and prospects. Defendants specifically refused to inform investors that:

3D Systems violated adequate internal controls on financial reporting.
As a result, Defendants’ claims about 3D Systems, activities, and prospects were materially inaccurate and deceptive and/or lacked a fair basis at all applicable times.

3D Systems filed an NT-10K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2021, reporting that its 10-K filing will be postponed for the reasons stated in their March 1, 2021 press release.

776,2021-05-18,stocks,"The article in NYT outlines why ATT has all this horrible debt. Sounds like incompetence. All three deals were failures. And take a look at that last paragraph below. They spent over $150M just in advisory fees in 3 years to end up where they were to begin with but with more debt.  “After all of that deal-making, ATT is sitting on more than $170 billion in debt. As part of the deal with Discovery, ATT will get $43 billion to help reduce its debt load. (The spun-off media business will begin its independent life with $58 billion in debt.)”

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/18/business/ATT-WarnerMedia-Discovery.html?referringSource=articleShare


The DealBook newsletter explains how ATT got here, in three key deals:

1..A $39 billion bid to buy T-Mobile. After regulatory pushback, in 2011 ATT walked away from an effort to become the country’s largest wireless company. T-Mobile paired up instead with Sprint, and the two went on to buy huge amounts of spectrum in the high-stakes battle for 5G, leaving ATT behind as it lobbies regulators to step in. The failed deal hit ATT with a $3 billion dollar breakup fee, at the time the largest ever.

2.  The $67 billion acquisition of DirectTV. In 2015, ATT bet on cable TV as a way to amass customers whom it could eventually convert to streaming. But DirectTV bled subscribers as customers cut the cord, and ATT unloaded a stake in the company last year to TPG that valued DirectTV at about a third of its acquisition price. The deal also cost ATT about $50 million in advisory fees, according to Refinitiv.

3.  The $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. In 2018, Mr. Stephenson called the deal a “perfect match,” but the combined group struggled to invest in its telecom business while also spending enough to compete with the entertainment specialists at Netflix and Disney. Three years later, ATT is now spinning off the company so it can (re)focus on its quest for 5G market share. ATT paid $94 million in advisory fees to put the two companies together and an estimated $61 million to split them apart.",nfl6c8,[],0
