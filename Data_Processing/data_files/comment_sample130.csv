In some cases I'm storing hundreds of millions of data points per symbol. 

Being a software engineer, I prefer to do EDA in my programming language of choice as opposed to using SQL queries. If you are using a 'fast' programming language and the dataset can fit in memory, it can be a lot faster in some cases than using SQL, even if you take the time to set up all the right indexes.

146,2021-05-18,algotrading,"This seems quite normal from my experience of looking at technical analysis trading systems that focus on high winning percentages (swing/mean reversion) rather than high payoff ratios (trend following).

High win% systems tend to have worse win:loss ratios (payoff ratios) and often use profit targets with far wider stops than normal. The extra risk they're taking is why they're able to achieve high winning percentages.  It allows more room for the swing trade to swing in their favour (at the expense of a much larger loss if it doesn't swing in their favour).

The main thing I guess is he needs to assess what happens if he gets a continuous run of losing trades (perhaps by running some monte carlo simulations over a long testing period).  Looking for the worst case scenario for a run of losses and risk of ruin.

196,2021-05-18,algotrading,"1. Don’t use coding to dictate your strategy, instead come up with a sound premise like a strategy based on sound market dynamics and it’s states e.g trending, mean reversion, breakout, consolidation. use code to implement that strategy for testing. Your strategy is a hypothesis only. You backtest it as an experiment to test your hypothesis 

2. Ensure you back test with enough sample trades - trading your strategy on 500 trades is not enough sample data to rely on the results. Understand the law of big numbers. You want to expose your strategy to all market conditions and let it place at least 2500 trades for the results to be of value and to give you a better indication as to its edge.

3. Ensure the tick data or backtest data is clean and accurate (no missing candles etc) and also find a way to ensure the spread of your data reflects that of your broker. Spread from 10 years ago is greatly different from today’s average spread and spread can massively affect return (transaction costs add up and can dilute your results as to your strategies real edge)

4. Optimisations are meaningless unless you have ensured the tick data you have tested on is “accurate”, understand what makes tick data accurate.

5. If you’ve identified a sound hypothesis, coded it’s first iteration, tested it on accurate tick data (with enough trades placed) and it has positive results, only then should you navigate towards optimisations and parameter adjustments 

6. If you’ve passed all the stress test from this point, expose it to real world market on demo account and results should reflect your backtest, pre live phase should confirm the same results as your backtest",gyjrldl,t3_ndl5xf,[],0

The answer is complex.  The short version is all traditional exchanges you would consider reputable offer co-location services.  Some run their own dedicated data centers, some have carved out spaces with other providers and offer cross-connects to that portion of the data center for a fee.

Crypto is still kind of the wild west.  Coinbase is trying to bring the traditional model to crypto and is actively working (maybe already completed?) colocation services.

Then you are probably stuck using a generic setup with a shitty 1G switch which adds some latency. You are also probably stuck behind a VM which adds a ton of latency. 

Now I’m not going to tell you it’s impossible but the infrastructure costs to get setup are not nothing. If you want to look into it I believe coinbase hosts through AWS at either Ohio or Virginia (this was the case a few years ago) so you can get an idea of the costs.

Which fee tier are you in?   
Because i am pretty sure the fees are 0.1% (0.075% with BNB rebates) for Spot trading.   
And with Futures you have 0.04% (0.0360% w/ rebate) Taker and 0.02% Maker (0.018% w/ rebate).

Unless you are a whale on Binance with incredibly high trading volume and 6 figures BNB balance, you are not getting 0.01% fees anywhere.  


But let's do a little calculation here anyways to get a grip if what you are doing is possible. Always do this when developing strategies! Start from a really simple model that is plausible and provable and then put parts in one by one. Never start with a complicated model.  
Let's start easy with following assumptions (we can later add more complications to our model or change its parameters)  


(1) We have no fees  
(2) We make a trading decision every minute  
(3) Volatility: We observe that every minute we expect the price to move by Sigma = 0.15% (up or down) on average throughout the day (this is a somewhat realistic average value for many cryptos. of course volatility changes all the time on every timeframe)  
(4) We close our trade after every minute (for the models simplicity sake. of course you would let a winning position run if the following time horizon has the same prediction)  
(5) Let us assume that our ""HFT algo"" can achieve a 60% prediction up or down for the next minute. (which is pretty good)  
(6) No slippage on market orders, no lag  
(7) We use market orders, so we don't have to worry about fill probabilites (Kappa)  


How much do we profit? In 5 hours (300 minutes) we have 300\*0.6 = 180 winning trades with 0.15% profit = 27%. We lose 120 trades (300\*0.4) with each 0.15% loss = 18%.  
PNL = 27% - 18% = 9%  


Our incredibly simple model makes 9% in 5 hours. wow right? That works. We can procede further. Let us just add fees to our model.   


Let us assume we are trading futures with 0.04% per trade, which is cheaper than spot. We need to pay this fee every time we open AND close a position. In our model that would be 0.08% every trade/minute.  
So here we can see how bad our model gets busted by fees alone: 300 \* 0.08% = 24%  
Our new adjusted PNL = 9% - 24% = -15%. We lost 15% with our ""naive"" HFT algo that had 60% prediction capability every minute...

Our new adjusted PNL = 9% - 24% = -15%. We lost 15% with our ""naive"" HFT algo that had 60% prediction capability every minute...

So how good do we have to be to beat the fees (with this naive ""hft"" model?) and break even on our trades?
To calculate this i made this somewhat time independent and instead of minute closes i plugged in volatility as take profit and stop loss (0.15% each)
For break even we need to solve PNL = 0 = trade_count * win_percentage * TP - trade_count * (1- win-percentage) * SL - (trade_count * fees)
How many trades we do actually does not matter here, so we simplify: 0 = win_percentage * TP - (1- win-percentage) * SL - fees

Get your pen and paper... i'm kidding. We are not in school anymore, we can just plug this into wolframalpha:)

https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0+%3D+0.15x+-+%281-x%29+*+0.15+-+0.08

And we can see... to break even with this kind of approach we would need to win roughly 76% of the time.

We can adjust this model however we like and see what wolframalpha tells us:)
Let's say we find out that expected hourly price volatility is now around 1.5% (10 times more movement than on the minute timeframe)

Our next improvement is the following: Since take profit orders can be more easily transformed to limit orders, we can shave off some of our fees.
(i would keep stop loss market orders because stop loss limit orders that are placed on the book depending on a trigger event are not guaranteed to fill)

Instead of 0.08% (two future market orders 0.04% + 0.04%) we expect on average our fees to be: (0.04% + 0.5 * 0.02% + 0.5 * 0.04%) = 0.04% + 0.03% = 0.07%
(This is the worst case estimation of our fees, assuming our algo just coin flips between take profits and stop losses. Ideally we have more take profits and therefore less fees)

Next we want to earn 1% every 24 trades (assume a day of trading) with an average duration of an hour (1.5% volatility). So we place our TP and SL there.

What is the model now? 

profit_percent = trades* win_percentage * TP -  trades * (1- win-percentage) * SL - trades * fees
1 = 24 * x * 1.5 - 24* (1-x) * 1.5 - 24 * 0.07
https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+%3D+24+*+x+*+1.5+-+24*+%281-x%29+*+1.5+-+24+*+0.07

402,2021-05-19,algotrading,"No problem. Partly i wanted to write this down for myself also. 
I somewhat already had an idea, but never got around to actually calculate this out for some real world values:)

Maker orders are still 0.02% on binance futures. Let's say we have BNB rebates, so we have 0.018% and since we also need to close the order 0.036% in total.
The model tells us we still need over ~62% success rate to make profit on minute data with ~0.15% volatility on average.

But it gets worse. With limit orders you do not only need to predict if price goes up or down by TP and SL, 
we also need to know if we get filled.

What usually ends up happening is adverse selection: You don't get filled on most of your correct predictions,
(because price ticks up without anyone selling into your bid offer, and your order then rests a few levels deeper in the book and is essentially stale)

And the other way around: You sometimes also make a wrong prediction (30%) and now aggressive sellers gladly fill your bids only to take down your position into a loss.

So you don't get filled on many of your 70% correct predictions and you get filled on many of your 30% wrong predictions, which drags down your success rate to eventually losing money.

(This is also the reason why you can't just go to BitMex or ByBit and coinflip yourself to richness with -0.025% maker rebates)

Using limit orders with a simple statistical ""prediction"" does not suffice. What you need here is a way to solve an what is called an ""optimal control"" problem
in statistics, involving computing fill probability Kappa from level 2 orderbook data.

To make it short: If you have a low fee tier with high fee rates and you only mess with candle data, you wont be able to make it. All the odds are against you.
Fees and limit order mechanics are the way bigger elephant in the room than the problem of latency and colocation. 

I just wanted to spare you the time and money thinking just spinning up an Amazon AWS instance will solve all your problems. Nope. It won't.

605,2021-05-19,algotrading,"DSP is a big topic to take on. I just learned by programming Max/MSP patches and C/C++ extensions for sound processing. I was thinking more about the general approach than specific algorithms. 

For example, let's say you need a moving average. One way to calculate this is: store incoming ticks in an array of size N, and on each tick average the values in the array. If N is large, you can gain efficiency by storing the sum in a state variable. Then each tick you just add the new tick and subtract the oldest one; no looping over N values. There are also filters that do not even need the 'delay line' of the last N ticks; they just continually work with a couple of state variables (IIR filters). 

All that said, my mentor in those days told me something that I have always remembered: 

**OPTIMIZE LAST.**

We use our current feature set because it's the one which results in the most accurate model based on what we've tested so far.
