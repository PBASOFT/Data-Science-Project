57,2021-05-26,StockMarket," Hi everyone,

Royal Helium or $RHC is a Canada based pure play in Helium exploration. While stocks like Avanti Energy and Desert Mountain Energy have gone up wildly, Royal Helium is still comparably cheap, although

* they found a massive helium reservoir,
* will most likely start production in 2021,
* have THE largest land package of all of the helium companies.

The size of the land package of 1,000,000 acres is only second to North American Helium, that‘s a successful, yet unfortunately privately held company.

So I guess people are focussing too much on the wider spread headlines of those smaller companies, but Royal Helium has a much bigger headstart.

Currently valued at CAD 78MM they are looking at a business case (lower case) of at least CAD 165MM revenues with their current reserves discovered and crude helium sales at the well.

Also, they secured a CAD 15MM financing round in a bought deal, meaning money is safe and they can go into further developing wells.

Their Twitter channel is pretty informative and I really like the team!

What‘s your take on this and the other companies? To my knowledge there are

* Royal Helium
* Imperial Helium (IPOed recently)
* Desert Mountain Energy
* Avanti Energy
* American Helium

as relevant players. if you got that sector on the radar, let me know your take!",nlcets,[],1

Individual investors have no control over the market. Institutional investors, however, can completely shift markets by a media comment. Look at what happened to Tesla and crypto when Musk goes on Twitter. People with status have a lot of leverage. Institutions (whales) with large sums of money can also shift the market when they buy/sell. That’s why you might see random spikes. That’s usually done by someone with a lot of leverage.

The stock market is essentially a transfer of wealth from those who are impatient and stupid to the patient and educated. It serves many people well when the majority of people in the game are uneducated.

Beware of “pump and dump” schemes. A group will hype up a stock, pump loads of money into it to jack up the price, when other laymen see the trend and don’t want to miss out on profits so they pump their money in, the original group will dump their stock, cash in the profit, and essentially crash the value.",nmuhji,[],0

189,2021-05-28,StockMarket,"I got into AMC yesterday on the break above the highs from a couple months ago. I’m doing the same with a few other meme and high short-interest stocks which could see rapid gains in a short amount of time on the hype. I already made quick gains on JMIA, SPCE, and BYND. My strategy is always to have a stop loss I’m OK with, take partial profits on any jump up, and constantly raise stops as price appreciates. I also keep my position size small compared to my total portfolio. 

As a part of the general market I think the moves back to meme stocks is because people are frustrated where stocks are still bottoming and consolidating. The crypto correction has sent traders looking for wild gains elsewhere. This is causing rushes into smaller names wherever momentum starts to pick up and it means the moves could be short-lived. 

Markets get more and more wild as a top happens. Then it seems like just another dip when a decline has really begun. At this stage of the bull market while I’m being aggressive when the moment is right I will prioritize safety and honor my stops if things don’t go as I hope.

Recently, it was announced that the cannabis industry titan, GW Pharmaceuticals , was being acquired by Jazz Pharmaceuticals for $7.2 billion. Looking back to May of 2013 when GW first went public, it was trading at $8.90 - a mere fraction of its current market valuation of over $215 per share. At this time, the thought that the small cannabidiol company would later be the target of a 10-figure acquisition was one few saw coming.

However, those who saw the future growth potential of this industry player that forever changed the global cannabis market have been handsomely rewarded for their foresight. Although you may be too late for the cannabis sector, a similar boom in the psychedelic industry is just starting.

TRYP Therapeutics is one of the industry’s growing leaders within the psychedelic sector that many predict is following in the footsteps of GW, positioned to mirror its success.

The article can be seen below but these are the main reasons they vouch for Tryp's success:

* They are trying to break the stigma surrounding psychedelic treatments
* They are expanding their pipeline to include many different treatments from competitors
* Extensive Experience in Big Pharma
* Targeting more rare disorders that have a high demand for treatment

Similar to GW Pharma, Tryp Therapeutics is an American pharmaceutical company located in the biotech hotbed of San Diego, an area of Southern California, focused on researching and treating illnesses through synthesizing and legitimizing naturally occurring compounds for the treatment of rare diseases.

406,2021-05-28,StockMarket,"Maybe many of you never heard of Pinduoduo because the company main target is in China, not the people outside China. Their app and website don’t even have any language other than Simplified Chinese. However, it is a public company listed in the US stock market. Pinduoduo  an e-commerce platform. It offers a suite of product categories just like Amazon and Walmart in the US.

**The Numbers Seem Impossible Yet It is**

**We do believe whatever in the 26 May, 2021 quarterly financial report is definitely real. However, even we do believe it is real, still it raises some concerns to the company.** 

***We do assume no one is using Pinduoduo outside China.*** 

**The User Numbers**

It stated that the average monthly active users in the quarter was 724.6 million. Also, the monthly active users refers to the number of user accounts that visited the Pinduoduo mobile app during a given month, which does not include those that accessed the platform through social networks and access point.

Active buyers on Pinduoduo in the 12-month period ended March was about 824 million. Active buyers refers to the number of user accounts that placed one or more orders, regardless of whether the products and services are actually sold, delivered or returned.

However, let’s compare some well known e-commerce companies in China. Alibaba has 811 million active buyers, and JD has 499 million active buyers. The last two definitely have more people know outside or within China. Even a lesser know Meituan has 510.6 million paying users and you do see their delivery bicycles on every street in China. They are also all having much longer history than Pinduoduo. 

What is the concept of 824 million in China alone, let’s quote the Chinese Official data. 

Chinese netizens have 898 million in 2020. The internet availability rate was 70.4%. A total of 986 million Chinese used mobile phones to surf the internet, accounting for 99.7 percent of the online population. Around 309 million, or 31.3% of the online population, live in rural areas.

Which means more than 90% people in China who have internet access are using Pinduoduo and made a purchase on the website or the app within this 12 month period. It included part of those those around 300 million people who lived in rural areas and there monthly salary is less than $2000 RMB ($314). 

**Underweight**

**We are not by any means questioning the authenticity of the report, we do believe it is real.**

However, there would not be a huge growth rate for Pinduoduo active users. The average revenue per user is just one-fifth of Alibaba’s because Pinduoduo targets the lower end users, and the way they attract users is by giving them a subsidiary (coupons or cash equivalent) to keep their products price lower than other e-commerce platform. That’s just like burning money no matter which way you see it. It can be doing that forever. Because of that, many big brands are hesitant, if not, unwilling to open an official online flagship store in Pinduoduo. Hence, these are the reasons why we believed that Pinduoduo stock price is overpriced by a lot.",nn0cl4,[],0

(Bloomberg) -- The copper market, unlike oil, is supported by a dearth of new discoveries at a time of rising demand that will accelerate with decarbonization efforts, according to the world’s biggest publicly traded producer of the metal.

While government and market actions can have an impact in the short term, copper is a very long term business and is “extraordinarily strong,” Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson said in an interview Thursday.

“There’s no shale oil for copper,” he told Bloomberg Television. “Unlike the oil industry, where you have an ongoing flow of discoveries and now with a new element of shale coming in, copper mines of size are very rare to find.”

Bets on tight supplies have sent copper prices to record levels as major economies emerge from the pandemic and the energy transition boosts the outlook for the metal used in electric installations. The rally has cooled somewhat with the outlook of a tapering by the U.S. Federal Reserve and China’s efforts to ease a commodities price surge.

The industry is facing a supply scarcity that will require both copper substitution and increasing recycling, Adkerson said. If prices were to double tomorrow, Freeport would be unable to bring on new supply within five years, he said.

Freeport’s margins are expanding as near-record prices and a ramp-up at its flagship mine in Indonesia counter any cost increases. The company has “its arms around” input supply challenges, he said.

Host nation politicians and unions seeking a bigger share of the copper windfall is a typical response to surging prices, he said.

815,2021-05-28,StockMarket,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 28, 2021**

Stocks gained on Friday, with market participants encouraged by new economic data on consumer spending, income and inflation, and a strong Weekly unemployment report. The market has made a remarkable recovery, particularly in technology, after the market tumbled 4% following the April Consumer Price Index roughly two weeks ago. In my view, as I have said for weeks, the recovery in the market confirms that the initial sell-off driven by inflationary fears forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected was overblown.

New government data on Friday showed personal income fell less than expected in April, but still pulled back after March's stimulus-fueled surge. Personal income fell by 13.1% in April compared to March, less than the 14.2% drop expected. This follows a 20.9% increase during March which had been buoyed by the distribution of $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans. 

In another report, the Department of Commerce reported core personal consumption expenditures increased 3.1% in April from a year earlier, blowing past the Fed’s traditional 2% target. Federal Reserve members consider the core PCE to be the gauge of inflation. The strong inflation readings reported by the Commerce Department on Friday had been widely anticipated as the pandemic's grip eases, thanks to vaccinations, and will have no impact on monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that higher inflation will be transitory. Supply-chain constraints combined, labor shortages in certain industries, and rising demand as the US economy recovers from the coronavirus-induced recession have all contributed to higher inflationary readings. These are all factors that are widely considered transitory, meaning not permanent. In an April 28 statement, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said, “An episode of one-time price increases as the economy reopens is not likely to lead to persistent year-over-year inflation into the future. Clogged supply-chains won’t affect Federal Reserve policy because they’re temporary and expected to resolve themselves.” Moreover, he said “For inflation to move up in a persistent way that moves expectations up, that would take some time, and you would think it would be likely we would be in very strong employment for that to happen.” In other words, Powell is saying he expects issues driving inflation higher to resolve themselves moving forward and doesn’t expect inflationary pressures to materialize until the labor market further improves.

In remarks this week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Fed, offered a slightly different view but one that is in-line with what the Federal Reserve has already said publicly in the past. Clarida said, “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

The Department of Labor’s Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week to yet another pandemic-era low, an encouraging sign that the labor market is improving following the extremely disappointing April Jobs report, which showed 266,000 new jobs added in the month, far below estimated of more than 1 million and a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March.

The stock market's strength ended on a good note this week. On the upside, it looks like two distribution days will fall off the map for the $QQQ next week and three for the $SPY. At the same time, three distribution days will become less significant for both the $SPY and $QQQ next week. That is a good sign and should lead to a ramping up in buying power from institutions. The only way we will lose this momentum is if we gain a lot more distribution days next week. 

During market uptrends, you have the home-field advantage, so the scene is perfect for buying and making profits. Please keep in mind that even though things are looking good, the market loves to give surprises and turn quickly, so taking precautions to protect yourself, such as using a stop-loss, is essential to success. It is more profitable to ask yourself, ""How much could I lose?"" rather than ""How much can I gain?""
