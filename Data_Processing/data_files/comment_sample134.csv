47,gz0t7pk,2021-05-22,t1_gz0emuh,investing,">It would make more sense for each shareholder to decide how much they want their cut to be distributed amongst those 3 buckets - and the company execs can make a pitch for why certain buckets should be prioritized. 

That is 100% how it does work. Every year the share holders elect the board of directors.  For the most part the board of directors decide this; the board also appoints the C level executives (CEO, CFO, COO, CIO) and those executives hire the rest of the employees. Now its majority rule; if you want all the profits to be paid out in dividends but the rest of the share holders want to use the profits to pay down debt or expand; well majority rule. However if you can convince the rest of the share holders to vote to pay a dividend, well you can now appoint a BOD that will pay a dividend.

However not to go on a long tangent; but honestly the ""general public"" knows nothing about how to run a business.  Some companies where the founder controls over 50% of the voting rights (so they can basically do about anything they want) actually commands a ""premium"" vs companies who are share holder driven. Why? because usually the founder who has poured their heart and soul into the company and has lived and breathed the company for 10-15-20 years knows more about the company/industry and what is best than joe blow investor.

Again not go on a big tangent but look at facebook , Zuckerburg on a whim with one day just bought instagram. In a normal company this would have taken months of negotiation , share holder votes . However because Zuckerburg  controls the majority of the voting share he just did it. And it worked.

To keep going lets talk about netflix vs blockbuster. The common narrative is blockbuster was this dinosaur who failed to adapt and was eaten alive by netflix. The truth is far different. Blockbuster management early on saw the threat of netflix and did develop a plan to adapt. They created a subscription service  that had mail or in store pick up / drop off, and was even developing a streaming service . Also you hear that blockbuster passed up buying neflix for 50 million , at the time netflix was just like 5 warehouses and 200 employees. Blockbuster had 9000 stores and if they wanted to replicate the mail in service they basically could over night and didn't need netflix.

The issue is all of this stuff costed blockbuster a lot of money; the subscription service eliminated late fees what accounted for a big part of the revenue and the streaming service was hugely expensive in the mid 2000's . Now this cut into their profits, but they 100% realized this was necessary for their long term survival. That was until activist investor Carl Icahn bought 20% of the company then convinced other share holders that the management was dumb and needed to be replaced and was spending all this money on streaming an mail when it didn't need to because netflix was a fad. It ""worked"" and Carl Icahn was able to appoint a new BOD who fired the CEO , CFO and replaced them with people of their choice. The new CEO promptly cancelled all development of their streaming / mail service, cancelled their subscription service and implemented all their late fees.

It worked, for a bit; netflix for the next few quarters increased their profits, as they decreased R&D spending (scuttles their streaming service) then brought back late fees and everything customers hated about rental stores. Well the rest is history , and netflix ate them for lunch. 

So leaving the company direction up to Joe shareholder isn't always the best idea",[],0

The end value is the same so I am not super worried that I've lost money.

Is this just some kind of a UI error?

It's interesting that it ran up and then came down with other small-caps recently. I can't think of any other development during that time period (BABA came later IIRC?).

I like that it's a deep value play in a sense, but I also don't know if holding companies ever fully realize the value of their underlying. POAHY is an example. Will it ever catch up to VWAGY? 

I'm still holding POAHY. But unsure why lol. Read about the Burry thesis for it and bought. I like obscure stocks and companies. Some really are diamonds in the rough. But in this case, I'm not sure if this is a diamond in the rough so much as forgotten laggard that has no catalyst or plan to revitalize itself if only with good PR. The float is tiny, but so is volume like you said. It could move fast. But the BABA move didn't do much?

If you like this sort of thing, though, you should look at BOMN. It's a mini Berkshire and has ties to Berkshire itself. Has its own SPAC it brought to market and $DFH IIRC.

You keep repeating this, as if ""building wealth"" is a risk free strategy. As I explained to you the potential returns are higher but the risk is also higher. The average investor who is trying to save for his retirement shouldn't be taking large risks with that money. Or he shouldn't bitch when his investment strategy blows up in his face and he loses his life savings.

Because the average, mature investor is not a crypto kid or WSB ""genius"".

If you give them a credit you’re breaking company policy and risking termination. If you hang up you’re risking termination. If you speak your mind and tell them to shut up you’re fired on the spot and walked out by security.

So you have to sit there on the call and take it.

You aren’t allowed to go to the bathroom without approval.

You don’t get time between calls. You have a headset on. The next call automatically comes in the instant this call ends. If you push a button to take yourself out of the queue in between calls they hold it against you.

You keep talking about the average investor, as if everyone’s priorities are the same when this isn’t the case. You also keep talking about concentration as if it’s guaranteed to blow up your portfolio, yet if you chose a stock like brk then if anything you’d be safer in the case of a downturn.

354,gz1v1y9,2021-05-22,t1_gz1bpxp,investing,"BTC and ETH aren't even in the same taxonomy of cryptoassets, most people talking about ETH killing BTC lack a fundamental understanding of the role of each cryptoasset. BTC is a traditional cryptocurrency, but ETH is much more of a cryptocommodity because it offers access to the EVM. Often why you see BTC referred to as 'digital gold' and 'digital oil'.

That's not to say ETH can't surpass BTC in price because the value of what it does is higher, but to say their somehow in competition is naive. We're still so early in the cryptomarket that the entire economy is pegged to BTC, which is obvious right now, but that could change in the future. Regardless of where ETH and BTC end up relative to eachother that's not evidence of either displacing the other, because they're really solving seperate issues. It's kind of like saying Intel will replace Nvidia in the future, it's not that Intel couldn't surpass Nvidia's market cap at some point (they've already played jumprope here before), it's that Intel and Nvidia are not solving the same issues so to say that one replaces the other is absurd. While Nvidia makes CPU's they're only higher-end and used in the scientific computing context where Nvidia shines, and while Intel makes integrated GPU's they haven't been interested in breaking in to the higher-end GPU market, so neither of them are really much in competition in the first place.

In short: ETH can't take over BTC's job because Ether is inflationary, the BTC supply cap is integral to the role of BTC as a cryptocurrency. BTC can't take over ETH's job because BTC doesn't allow for smart contracts (BCH might disagree on this point) or faciliate tokens on top of it's ecosystem, while the EVM is integral to the role of Ethereum as a cryptocommodity. People who understand both of these cryptoassets also know that they have completely different reasons for existing. You can of course make the argument that BTC will become irrelevant in the future regardless because a cryptocurrency with a max supply who's sole role is facilitating it's own transactions isn't what the market will want, but you can't make the argument that ETH will become that, because ETH is solving an entirely different problem.",[],1

here in the UK there are two main options - and if you're only planning to invest £20,000 you can out it into a tax free ISA. this means it is tax free of capital gains tax and i believe dividends. 

In terms of providers, Trading 212 as a few options like your VUSA (S&P 500 tracker index) and other ""vanilla"" index funds as well as a few REITs and is entirely commission free.

Hargreaves Lansdown charges commission and for maintaining the account, but the offer a wide range of funds - basically everything you can think of. for example i own something called "" AXA Framilington Global Technology Fund"" and a bunch of other things. It's honestly endless. 

Just make surer for hargreaves lansdown you turn of getting posted reports as they charge £20 a year for this! (its becuase they are in many ways a boomer company that lets people trade via phone and text) 

personally, i would choose hargreaves lansdown if your plan is to just buy some index trackers and come back in 10,20 years. it is one of the big boys in the UK and is designed for this. also, unlike trading 212 a) you can transfer your stocks as you actually own then and b) i actually trust them t have my best interests at heart (for example eToro and trading 212 halted $GME but HL didn't)

403,gz21vja,2021-05-22,t3_nhixq1,investing,"I've used all the cloud providers for my job. AWS has a feature set that scales for the giants. Just an absolutely amazing product. Azure is a popular choice because most enterprises naturally use Office 365, but it's a bit more clunky and non-intuitive to use IMHO.

Being able to spin up a web server and have it reachable from any AWS datacenter in the world, is just unreal. Developers design their applications around AWS's feature set, which simply is not the case for other cloud providers.

It's pretty clear with the switch of CEO to Andy Jassy that they believe they have peaked their revenue with ecommerce, and have a lot more to squeeze out of AWS. Cloud adoption still has A LOT of room in this decade.

For that, I am extremely bullish. It is the most expensive cloud provider, but for good reason. Everything is just so god damn well engineered.",[],1

405,gz222vn,2021-05-22,t3_nieh3e,investing,"Trading on margin, getting yourself indebted to start trading is the dumbest thing one could do with its money, unless your debt is 0% interest. Yours is not.

Let’s see. If you have a 9.5% interest, you’d need to achieve a 10% net return (excluding hence fees and taxes) for 5 straight years in a volatile market at record highs.

But that would fly only if you keep the invested capital in and you start compounding interests. But if you take out from your capital to repay your debts it would be extremely difficult to keep netting € 2,556 in returns every year.

Even if you somehow manage to achieve this, at the end of the 5 years you would find yourself where you are now.

You are 20, you are really young, there is no need to have €10K to start investing. Think instead of this: if you only start investing each month 3% of your salary, you end up with € 2.745 after 5 years and no returns.

411,gz22kfy,2021-05-22,t1_gz13jix,investing,"Thank you for all the other recommendations.  I can absolutely see the comparisons to a holding company but in my opinion, the true deep value is from their legal SaaS business, not from their equities.  In this case, their equities provide a bottom value that the company can reach (similar to how ABBA once had a minimum floor value that was tied to the value of BABA).  

In this case, the deep value comes from Journal Tech which has about a hundred million dollars of revenue that can't be found anywhere on their financial statements.  The accounting practices of DJCO are horrid, but in a manner that can be truly beneficial to early investors since all of this locked-in revenue cannot be identified by stock screening algorithms used by medium to large financial institutions.  These revenues will begin appearing on DJCO's financial statements in a few years, at which point their margins will be incredible because the most labour-intensive work (i.e. configuration) will have already been completed whilst DJCO was not reporting revenue.

To quote Munger during the 2017 DJCO annual meeting, ""You can’t look at our financial statements and make very good judgments about what’s going to happen.""

With that said, I will take a look at the tickers that you recommended as I love looking at random (to me) companies and seeing if there is any value tucked away that is being mispriced by the market.  Cheers.",[],0

482,gz292u0,2021-05-22,t1_gz281o6,investing,"BTC is a digital cash system, i.e. money. Money is defined as something that has some combination of these functions:

* Unit of Account

* **Store of Value**

* Standard of Deferred Payment

* Means of Exchange

BTC was intentionally created with a supply-cap of 21 million to avoid being an inflationary currency, like all current fiat equivelents. It's supposed to be money you can keep in money form without it losing value over time, that's clearly an intentional design of the currency, otherwise it would just have been inflationary which would have been easier to design altogether. Satoshi designed it as such to avoid it falling into the trap of inflationary fiat currencies that are not at all very good stores of value, because governments actively want to incentivize spending and investing.

Trust me, I've read the whitepaper, feel free to disagree with me, but don't accuse me of not having read it just because you didn't realize that 'store of value' was an integral function in the definition of money, and not something maxis just made up. I never said BTC was *only* a store of value, just that it was a store-of-value cryptocurrency, I highlight store of value because it's relevant when discussing BTC in relation to an asset like ETH, because ETH is inflationary.",[],0

Steel supply is low due to Covid, and demand is higher than normal due to Covid too since many projects were delayed, so now all those are in process as well as regular construction and infrastructure that would take place, even if Biden's infrastructure bill passes or not. On top of that, China, responsible for over half the steel manufactured in the world, is cutting production/adjusting rebates to deal with pollution in its manufacturing cities and climate change as a whole. That's a major thing for non-Chinese manufacturers.

\- CEO says that thier production system is faster, cheaper and MOST IMPORTANTLY cleaner compared with traditional technology. USA and EU are gonna ask for sustainable production models.

This becomes even more apparent when the money isn’t actually backed by cash, your bank account is an IOU, and because of the fractional reserve system you aren’t even guaranteed to recieve it if everyone withdrawa at the same time.

Not saying this is good or bad, there are solid economic arguments for the fractional system, but the fact that other electronic forms of money are not backed by cash is *exactly* why Satoshi called it an electronic cash system.

637,gz2oqxm,2021-05-22,t3_nikmbr,investing,"Former municipal bond investment banking analyst (underwriter) here. Really excited I have something to contribute here as munis are rarely in the spotlight.

Some other comments have noted NJ’s credit profile as a reason not to buy their munis as the state could possibly declare bankruptcy and is relatively quite leveraged.

It’s worth noting that municipal bankruptcy are incredibly rare, especially when you compare them to corporate bonds and their default rates. There are only a dozen or so notably bankruptcies over the 20th century. The low historical default rates relative to their perceived credit quality culminated in the Connecticut attorney general suing rating agencies in 2008 for misrepresenting their credit quality and as a result forcing Connecticut taxpayers to pay unjustifiably high interest costs. I believe S&P settled with the state in 2015. So in general I believe munis have a tendency to be perceived more risky than they actually are, at least by the rating agencies. S&P rates US treasuries as AA+ and sone munis AAA.

That being said, at the state level the largest risk in my opinion are the pension plans. Pension benefits as a percentage of costs for municipalities, particularly states, have been going up. Their pension funding ratios have been trending down. This is because they promised employees / unions a retirement benefit based on 30+ year assumptions of rates from the 80s and 90s, and returns across the board have gone down since then. When municipal bankruptcies are declared, the municipality is usually forced to choose between its bond holders and its pension holders. In one of the largest municipal bankruptcies, the WPPSS (“Whoops”) bankruptcy of a Washington power plant, the Washington Supreme Court sided with the pensioners.

Therefore if I were to buy munis at the state level (I’m not currently - too young and too low an income tax bracket, but I intend to be a buyer as I get closer to retirement. I live in a state with an income tax), I would look primarily at their pension funding ratio as the most relevant indicator of risk. I personally would be unlikely to lend to a municipality with a funding ratio below 70%.

If you want to do some due diligence on understanding the risks associated with munis, I recommend the following short and easy to read (dare I say fun when it comes to muni bonds?) book:

https://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Muniland-Municipal-Investing-Post-Crisis/dp/0985344741

Also, Michael Lewis (Big Short, Liars Poker) has a great chapter on the California bankruptcies of the early 2000s that touches on the major pitfalls municipalities face in managing their debt in the following book:

So add that into their cash. Their growth prospects and company guidance is phenomenal in my opinion.

for - you understand the industry and are in a better position to pick winners and losers       

against - you work in the industry and any industry wide negative event will hit you twice, once at your job and a second time in  your portfolio.  You are in effect concentrating  your risk exposure in one industry.

Call ABC makes me a profit of 100k

Call XYZ I make a loss of 100K and this call expires on Dec 20th 2020.

At the end of the year I think I am good as I have 100k gains -100k losses so I shouldn't have any extra taxes

However I then buy another call for XYZ on Jan 2nd, now thats a wash sale and now my 100k loss cannot be claimed in 2020 it goes to 2021 meaning now I just have a 100k gain in 2020.",[],0

My recommendation: AVOID!  
  
Be wary of recommendations that Robinhood is ""Best for Beginners"".  
I cannot think of one good reason that has to do with rational investing.  
In fact, I will WARN new investors that there is truth in the concern that Robinhood's ""way's of operating"" steers investors, especially new investors, into investing in ways that may not be in their best interest!  
  
If you are new to investing ... do not even check them out!  
Ameritrade, Fidelity and many others are much better for new investors.  
Compare what Robinhood offers to Ameritrade, Fidelity or others ... and you will not choose Robinhood first!  
  
I have been disgusted with Robinhood's responses to my questions since opening my account.  
I had questions they were unable to answer due to ineptitude.  
I figured some out on my own.  A ""broker"" had answered that he/she did not know how to do what I had asked.  I responded with an email that I figured it out and how to do it.  Got a thank you for telling them how to do their job!  
  
It has been over 1 week since I first asked for a response to questions I had.  I have received a few emails in response ... from at least 3 different ""brokers"".  All responses were form letters that a ""bot"" could have answered better.  
  
So the following email was sent to Robinhood today:  
  
STOP WITH YOUR RESPONSES FROM YOUR FILE ... DO MY JOB WITHOUT WORKING OR THINKING!  
  
I have withdrawn most of my money from Robinhood because of the ineptitude revealed in your responses.  Your a broker?  Really?  
Also because Robinhood's features and programming could be done better by a 10 year old.  
  
Which raises, to me and I have read other investors have the same ... question/concern: Does Robinhood do this to rip off its customers?

726,gz32osd,2021-05-22,t1_gz2unkq,investing,"Also worth knowing is that income from such securities is often federally tax exempt and under certain circumstances also state exempt. This can effectively double the return profile post-tax for high income earners. They vary in method of repayment (general state obligation, special tax levy, etc.), location, and credit quality, which has been solid over a long period. You can get exposure buying individual bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, and closed-end funds, my favorite. One reason is such funds often trade at a discount which boosts the tax-advantaged income. Another is leverage, also emphasizing the tax-advantaged income. MUC, for example, borrows about 40% against the portfolio at super cheap rates to buy more securities. It increases returns and adds volatility. From the end of 2019 to the low of the pandemic, MUC dropped from $14 to $10.76, or about 23%. That’s much better than equities but didn’t increase like US bonds at that same time. Now MUC has rebounded and outperformed while TLT is back to its pre-pandemic price. Anyway, you could make an argument individuals could sub munis for their bond allocation and pick up some yield at not much extra risk. The total muni market isn’t huge like government treasuries, so mostly bigger investors can’t make large allocations, so the littler investors have an opportunity. BBN is a nice fund of taxable muni bonds which at times over the years has yielded 6%+ and been a nice little compounder.",[],1

Both companies will invest and build fabs in USA, so in case of major conflict, American companies will have access to chips and possibly to decouple.

Usa already promise 50 billions subsidies for semiconductors, and they will keep raising it.

To keep China in check,  semiconductors are the most important. You dominate whole tech imndustry, when you are dominant in semiconductors.

* >  I worry I will lose some of the free money

That stock wasn't free.  It is regular old **taxable income** to you at the time the shares vested; you paid normal withholding taxes on it; and the value of the shares at vesting will be reported on your **W-2** the same as any other earned income.  So don't let the ""free money"" aspect of this cloud your judgement.

* Similarly, once the shares vested, you **own** them -- no different from any other shares you purchased on the open market.  Yeah, they're locked up for a while, but those shares have no loyalty to you, and you should have no particular loyalty to them just because you work there.  The decision to keep or sell should be less emotional that way.

* Finally, if you -do- want to hold them, there's no need to sell them and repurchase elsewhere -- they will transfer from one account to another same as any other shares.

Caravana buys their cars at auction mainly, details and prepares them, sells them and stands behind them if their is an issue.  LOTZ does exactly the same except they are consigned.  To recognize revenue as they do must have been approved by auditors, lawyers etc pre SPAC.  So it really should be a moot point.

Focus instead on the 10 year track record.  They source cars cheaper, they process them, and they sell them.  The consignor gets more than through the auction process, the buyer pays a little less also.  So in a 1 trillion, totally fragmented used car business that moves +- 5% between good years and bad years there is virtually unlimited growth.

LOTZ has higher customer satisfaction scores than all their competitors.

Lol there are 9 muni bankruptcies right now in the entire US. That is basically nothing when you look at how many there are.  Also Puerto Ricos bankruptcy isnt even done. You dont know what the settlement is gonna be for bondholders. 

>which are roughly 66% for rated muni bonds.

I mean you're wrong....


>Understanding that recovery rates represent a margin of safety in the event a bond defaults, for rated general obligation bonds, the recovery rate is almost 100%. When a municipal issuer defaults on general obligation debt, the issuer is obligated to use every bit of taxation power at their disposal to satisfy bondholders. The full faith and credit of the issuer is the guarantee that is backing the bonds. For instance, a local issuer may be forced to increase property taxes dramatically, while a state may have to increase personal and or corporate income taxes. A county may have to sell off a major park or physical property. Whatever means can be used to return bondholder principal must be exercised. In other states, such as California for example, general obligation debt payment is mandated, by State constitution, to be paid back prior to fulfilling many of its other obligations.

As an example PBT pays about 6% based on their last monthly dividend (about 2.1 cents per share) and share price (about $4.20 per share).  If the price of oil goes up (or even stays higher) then the units (shares) will probably go up in value, and as a bonus you can even get some tax advantages on selling the shares (but not the dividends) by 1031'ing into another unit trust or similar investment.  This is kinda complicated to explain but just realize you can defer taxes on gains in the share/ unit price by buying a similar investment and carefully following the rules.

As an added bonus for this particular stock/ trust, they just switched operators about 9 months ago (from Conoco to a group called Blackbeard) and the new operator has really picked up the drilling which has caused the oil pumped and thus sales (and stock price) to go up, but it looks like it may keep going up for at least another year (or it may not).

Do your own DD but there was another guy pumping this stock on reddit so you can look for his DD if you are interested. However be a bit warned.

I'm a 20yr old student in Canada.  
  
I'm doing research to begin investing and I was wondering whether it would be better to LSI or DCA right now.  
  
Through my research, LSI outperforms DCA long term, but the stocks that I am looking at ($DIA, $SPY, $TD) are at all time highs - in addition, Warren Buffett recommends to DCA during volatile markets.

Generally speaking you are talking about a trailing stop.  A trailing stop follows the price up. Once the price tops, your stop is set as whatever you put in.  Maybe you put 2% or 50 cents.  If the price falls to your current stop it will trigger an order.  If the price falls but doesn't hit your stop then rises again, your stop will follow it up again to the next high. 

The risk is getting stopped out too soon.  You can't set your trailing stop to begin above the current price.  Which means if it dips as soon as you set it, you are stopped out.  The other risk is volatility. If the stock price is trending up but is bouncing on the way up, it can hit your stop and execute.

This page is useful for understanding this concept with examples.  https://tradingsim.com/blog/set-trailing-stop/

The reality is most individual investors get a vibe about a company, look at the price chart and anchor on a price, then estimate if the company is over or under-valued based on the anchor. The prices themselves for the purpose of the investor is totally detached from the actual financial performance of the company, because that was not a consideration for the investor, and so the whole thing is just rolling the dice. 

Very few individual investors crack open a balance sheet and income statement, make conservative estimates for revenue growth, determine a reasonable discount rate for the risk of the firm, then compare that to the market cap.
