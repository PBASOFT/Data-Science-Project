11,2021-05-20,stocks,"I have been intrigued by the SEC FTD report for some time. So I had some free time to mash all of the 2021 bimonthly reports. This has brought more questions than answers for me.

Theoretically an FTD is anything that didnt clear, right? For a trade that is T+3 and an option contract its T+2. This info is generated by the SEC, but why isn't it generated by the clearinghouse?

Anyway here are some highlights so far for 2021: 
(taking price on report multiplied by shares FTD)
Nearly $306B in FTD securities value
*needs to be mentioned the SEC doesn't report sub penny
15,557 tickers had an FTD
21.9B shares are reported FTD

It surprises me to see ETFs, Spiders, and really this much volume. I am not new to the market, but new to this level of analysis. Is this normal? This just seems holistically inefficient. Would a real time, or near real time, clearing process resolve this mess? I believe it would.

I am interested in commentary. I can answer some questions but I have more questions than answers at this point.",ngptt4,[],1

286,2021-05-20,stocks,"Simply put, you can’t control the market but you can control the size your position. How is that relevant? 

Well, you need to calculate how much leverage your account can afford. 
Making money when the market goes up is easy, you just buy and sell woohoo but real money comes from when the market goes down.

That’s when position sizing becomes relevant. How? 

If you have enough leverage left over, doesn’t matter how negative your position becomes. If the market reverses on you or if your company gets bad PR. You can simply do the math and figure out how many new shares you need to dilute your average price all the way down to the current price or 1% above it, the rest is history.

302,2021-05-20,stocks," Frontline Ltd., a shipping company, engages in the seaborne transportation of crude oil and oil products worldwide. It owns and operates oil and product tankers. As of December 31, 2020, the company operated a fleet of 68 vessels. It is also involved in the charter, purchase, and sale of vessels.

Starting with a PE ratio of 4 and a PB ratio of 1 is always a good start. But then again most taker companies are now trading at a low PE ratio. Their net income, revenue and profit margin were increasing in the last 3 years which is a really good sign. One not so good sign is their debt which has increased from 1.8 to 2.2 billion in the last 4 years.

You could consider that shipping oil is not a good business anymore because renewables but changing to renewables cannot be done in an instant so the transition will be slow. For example the Chinese oil consumption reached an all time high in December 2020. In the same time a lot of companies have reduced their number of shipping vessels due to the low demand in last year. 

To take something from their SEC filling regarding risk:

“The demand for our oil tankers derives primarily from demand for Arabian Gulf, West African, North Sea, Caribbean, Russian and US Shale crude oil, which, in turn, primarily depends on the economies of the world's industrial countries and competition from alternative energy sources. Any decrease in shipments of crude oil or change in trade patterns from the above mentioned geographical areas would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Among the factors which could lead to such a decrease are:

• increased crude oil production from other areas;

• increased refining capacity in the Arabian Gulf or West Africa;

• increased use of existing and future crude oil pipelines in the Arabian Gulf or West Africa;

• a decision by oil-producing nations to increase their crude oil prices or to further decrease or limit their crude oil production;

• armed conflict in the Arabian Gulf and West Africa and political or other factors; and

• the development, availability and the costs of nuclear power, natural gas, coal and other alternative sources of energy. In addition, volatile economic conditions affecting world economies may result in reduced consumption of oil products and a decreased demand for our vessels and lower charter rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and our ability to pay dividends. “

I don’t really know how to evaluate these so I will let you evaluate them. They also say that “If the tanker industry, which historically has been cyclical and volatile, declines in the future, our revenues, earnings and available cash flow may be adversely affected.“ which basically means the earnings might go up or they might go down. The same is with the stock price.

Personally I think they will do well at least the next year because the demand for oil is still high, China is running on all cylinders because they need more and more energy, the airlines will start having more airplanes in the sky which will kickstart refineries and until “green solutions“ kick in we will need something.

This is just for information purposes, it is not investment advice, I am not an investing professional. Do your own due diligence before investing.

Have a good week!

329,2021-05-20,stocks,"I participate in my companies ESPP. Before Covid, the stock seemed to be fairly steady. It did dive during Covid, but has since recovered, which led me to nice gains (200%) on the last purchase. But usually I just sell it immediately for the 15% gain they let us purchase for 15% off. 

But I’m thinking, is this really that great of a deal? 

I put in 10% of my paycheck. So this is post tax money. 

I’m in about the 15% avg tax rate. 

So say I make $100,000 a year. (Married we make around $220,000 after deductions)

I am taxed $15,000 annually. (15%) 

I put in $8500 of post tax money into the ESPP. ($85,000*10%). 

Company lets me buy at 15% discount. So I get let’s say $9,775. So I spent $8,500 to get $9,775. Nice! 

Then I pay short term capital gains tax of $195. So that’s a net of $9584. 

But I was taxed on that initial $8500. 15% is my avg bracket. So that pre tax money was $9775. So now I’m losing money. I earned $10,000 to make $9584. 

Why not just put this directly into my 401k where I am not taxed on it (obviously until I retire) and my $10,000 (10%) is a real $10,000 into my account? 

Can someone tell me if my math and logic is correct?",ngsouj,[],1

437,2021-05-20,stocks,"Elon got to be having fun overseeing Tesla’s accounting.

He had Tesla buy ‘coins, whose price is largely influenced by his tweets. If tweeting is fun, I can imagine tweeting and watching an asset price move in response has to be even more! Owning said asset probably entitles to some additional giggles.

Then last quarter Tesla sold some of the bitthings to “prove liquidity”. I’m not sure if anyone felt the need of such proof, but by lucky coincidence this had the totally unintended side effect to allow Tesla to post a profit for the quarter. Cheers!

How could this story become even more amusing?
Here is a possibility: if the coins price falls below the estimated $3,700 buying price and Tesla still HODL it next quarter, it will have to immediately report a loss on it.

Given Elon’s loving care for Tesla’s share price, if ‘coin price keeps slumping as Earnings approach he may take the first chance to dump it at break-even or better price.
Probably claiming the reason to Save the Earth from coin’s carbon footprint or something, maybe after some semi related tweet pumping in a plausibly-deniable way.

That would be good for Tesla, maybe. But most likely bad for both ‘coins price and Elon’s reputation.

Anyway, if ‘coins price goes down there is potential for some new Musk-related drama.

509,2021-05-20,stocks,"So about me:
Got into trading last year, was unemployed, don't have trader tax status

So my question is regarding deducting a large capital loss last year against a large capital gain this year and if there is a 3k cap on that if i don't have trader tax status?

for example, if last year (2020), let's say i had 20k in capital loss from stocks. Now this year (2021), let's say i have 100k in capital gains.  CAn i deduct the full 20k capital loss from last year to this year's 100k capital loss, making my taxable capital gain income essentially 80k?   OR since i just a regular trader with no trader tax status with the IRS, i can only deduct 3k of that capital loss this each and the remainder carries over each year, making this year's taxable capital gain income 97k?

I'm reading online and there is so many conflicting info.  Some say that it's 3k max each year, and you will only be able to deduct 3k until you deduct the full capital loss through the years, every year.  Others say that only up to 3k of the 20k loss is deductible  if it is against ""Regular income"", but if you have a huge capital gain this year (like 100k in this example), you can deduct the full 20k for this year.

I know, before you guys say go to speak to an expert cpa and etc...yes yes i know, i will.. But i am still also wanting to hear advice or answer of anyone who's been in this situation before.

Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SPCE) (""Virgin Galactic"" or the ""Company""), a vertically integrated aerospace and space travel company, today confirmed that the next rocket-powered test flight of SpaceShipTwo Unity will be conducted on May 22, pending weather and technical checks. This follows the completion of a maintenance review of VMS Eve, the mothership jet aircraft designed to carry SpaceShipTwo to an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet.

""Following a detailed inspection and thorough analysis of our mothership, Eve, we have cleared our Spaceflight System for our upcoming flight. I want to thank our incredibly talented team of engineers, maintenance crew, quality inspectors and support staff for their diligence and hard work, which is testament to our commitment to safety and the integrity of our flight test program,"" said Michael Colglazier, Chief Executive Officer of Virgin Galactic.

Virgin Galactic regularly monitors its vehicles to verify their condition and inform timing of future upgrades and modifications that can improve performance or reduce future maintenance work. A post-flight inspection of VMS Eve in early May called for further engineering analysis to assess a known maintenance item in the tail of the vehicle, which was scheduled to be addressed during the next maintenance period. This analysis has been completed with the Company determining structures healthy, clearing Eve for flight.

The upcoming VSS Unity test flight will be crewed by two pilots and will carry research payloads as part of the NASA Flight Opportunities program. A key objective of the upcoming flight will be to test the remedial work that has been completed on VSS Unity to lower the EMI levels experienced on the December 12, 2020 flight when the onboard computer halted ignition of the rocket motor. The flight will also incorporate all original test objectives, including assessment of the upgraded horizontal stabilizers and flight controls during the boost phase of the flight, evaluating elements of the customer cabin, and testing the live stream capability from the spaceship to the ground.

Following this May flight, and in line with normal procedures, the team will complete an extensive data review, which will inform the next steps in the test flight program.
