84,2021-05-25,stocks,"Bought AMC back in February when everything kicked off.

I've had a few small OTC stuff with $100 thrown here or there in my account, this was my first foray into the real stock market.

Sold AMC last week at a loss, thought better of it, then bought it back in the dip. Cost basis went up (wash sale), so set a sell limit today and exited AMC when it dropped this morning after the spike up.

Basically AMC at this point is pump and dump trading by WSB subreddit.

Sold for a loss today because it was tanking pretty hard in the am a few times. My cost basis was adjusted from the wash sale, so total loss playing around with AMC was like $30.  Now it's up to $15+ again this afternoon??? Can't deal lol

Is it often stocks jump by $2-3 in a day at 15% gain/loss when the stock price is in the teens? I think not, unless big news for investors, no major news really for AMC or AMCs business plans so that's why it's mostly pump and dump, or a small squeeze at this point, but short float was 20% as of April 30th with millions of shares sold and bought each day.

Using this as an overall experience to: 1. Not have paper hands and panic sell at a loss, and most importantly, 2. Don't day trade meme stocks over with high volatility of it's value over months.  Might be a squeeze today I think and I paperhanded it, but you know what, I don't care, it was annoying wondering if it's ever going up or tank to sub 10s for the foreseeable future.

254,2021-05-25,stocks,"**$TAP**

I only make two or three ""high-conviction"" trades per year. When I trade, I go big with serious conviction. I want to tell you about my biggest trade ever - Molson Coors (3500 shares @ $55.44). I've also got a bunch of options that expire in October.

I am not a ""technical"" trader. Nor am I a ""fundamental"" trader. I'm a guy who follows Chris Camillo & and the Dumb Money ""social arbitrage"" style of investing. Chris has over a decade of 60%+ annual returns. The goal in this style of investing is to find game-changing information about a company that Wall Street doesn't know, research it like crazy, put on a trade, and then wait suits on Wall Street to discover the information when the company announces quarterly results. When game changing information is discovered by the suits in New York, they buy like crazy and drive the price up.

If you want to read more ""fundamental"" analysis on $TAP, read [this awesome due diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb868/molsoncoors_beverage_co_tap_dd_reopening_play/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) over on WallStreetBets from u/undream22.

**Background of the Trade:**

Molson Coors is an old company. They make the majority of their money off of cheap beer (e.g. Coors Light, Miller Lite, & Miller High Life). For the last 4-5 years, their stock has sunk because cheap beer is losing market share to hard seltzers and higher margin specialty beers.

Truly & White Claw took over the seltzer market which is growing quickly. FYI - hard seltzer's are way more profitable than beer.

The company got a new CEO who implemented a ""Revitalization Plan"" and is heavily investing in more profitable ""above premium"" beverages to make more money off of their huge distribution network. The important beverages include (but are not limited to) the following:

* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer
* Zoa - Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnston's energy drink
* Vizzy Hard Seltzer

**Thesis of the Trade:**

Molson Coors has three huge winners on its hands ***and Wall Street has no idea***. Once Molson Coors starts reporting actual numbers from Topo Chico, Vizzy, & Zoa at the end of this quarter they are going to crush all the analyst earnings estimates. This will lead to the big boys on Wall Street buying up TAP and driving up the price.

**Why Doesn't Wall Street Know Yet?:**

While the analysts certainly know that Molson Coors is distributing these beverages, they simply don't realize how big of a deal these drinks are. They don't know this because 1) the recent quarterly numbers do not reveal it, and 2) Wall Street doesn't pay attention to store checks, Google Trends, or the power of social media.

Let me explain:

* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer was released to the public on March 29, 2021. This preliminary launch was limited to nine select markets. Two days later, Molson Coors' Q1 ended.  **So, Wall Street doesn't have any actual numbers on Topo Chico Hard Seltzer yet**. I recommend that you listen to the Q1 call (April 29th). In the Q1 call, the CEO only talked briefly about getting unexpected market share in Texas with Topo Chico. However, based on the Dumb Money community channel checks (Check our our Discord group), stores in every market where it was released are selling Topo Chico HS like crazy. Topo Chico is selling as good (if not better) than Truly and White Claw. This is a huge deal. Moreover, Google Trends show people are searching ""topo chico hard seltzer"" more than ""truly hard seltzer"" and more than ""white claw hard seltzer."" That is amazing. And it was only released in NINE markets. It might be way bigger when it gets release to the rest of the country. Finally, #TopoChico is trending on TikTok and Instagram. Don't underestimate the power of social media.
* Zoa was released on February 24th (2/3's into Q1). Aannnddd, it's release was initially limited to online sales and select in-store sales. **Any numbers from Zoa were de-minimis in Q1 results**. They are expanding their distribution, and Dumb Money members are finding it in grocery stores now. Just spend a few minutes looking at the Rocks Instagram feed to see how hard he is pushing this drink. The branding is excellent and he has over 239m followers on Instagram and 15.2 million on Twitter. Google Trends show people are searching ""zoa energy drink"" just as much as ""monster energy drink"" and more than ""red bull energy drink."" Think about that for a second. A bran new energy drink is just as sought after as two established brans that own the market. Again, Don't underestimate the power of the Rock on social media.
* Last quarter Molson Coors had **two** **unexpected events that significantly reduced earnings**. 1). The Texas freeze shut down their biggest manufacturing plant in Fort Worth, Texas, for several days - impacting earnings. 2). They had a cybersecurity event that shut down production even further. Read/listen to the last earnings call to learn more about these two one-off events.
* Vizzy was launched in 2020 in the middle of the pandemic. Google Trends shows it starting to compete with Truly and White Claw. It is a ""healthier"" hard seltzer because it has vitamins (I guess). This competition came from only one variety pack. They just released a new lemonade version that is getting much higher reviews that competitors. Moreover, Dumb Money store checks show it is selling out in Canada.
* I expected the next two quarters are going to be gangbusters for the entire industry - lifting Molson Coors and all the other alcohol companies. Think about it. The vaccine is highly distributed finally. Summer is coming. So many people are going to have BBQ's, go to baseball games, go on vacations, and just let loose. And it is the summer of hard seltzerI don't think Wall Street understands how big pent-up demand is for having a good time. Alcohol is going to flow this summer unlike anytime we've ever seen before. TAP is the ultimate recovery play.
* From a fundamental analysis, TAP is highly undervalued in comparison to its competitors. Just take some time and look at $BUD, $SAM, $STZ and you'll see what I mean. Again, if you want to read more ""fundamental"" analysis on $TAP, read [this awesome due diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb868/molsoncoors_beverage_co_tap_dd_reopening_play/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) over on WallStreetBets from u/undream22.

Anyway, I'm tired of typing now. That is my trade. I hope someone appreciates this write-up.

Three final things:

1. If you want to know more about Chris Camillo, YouTube his famous Bloomberg interview. Also, he was recently featured in a recent ""Unknown Market Wizards"" book by Jack Schwager. Oh, and he wrote his own book back in the day called ""Laughing at Wall Street."" It's a great read.
2. I also HIGHLY recommend watching Dumb Money Live's episode on YouTube called ""Going ALL IN on $TAP""
3. I also HIGHLY recommend watching an older Dumb Money Live episode called ""Billion Dollar Energy Drink? Investing in ZOA from Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson""

In simple terms Enthusiast Gaming is company that aims to create massive gaming media network that then could be monetized by advertising, subscriptions, merchandise and content licensing. As such, its not not video games developer or publisher. It is more similar to advertising conglomerates like IPG, WPP or Omnicom who own many smaller agency businesses.

&#x200B;

>[https://postimg.cc/hzQgfHm2](https://postimg.cc/hzQgfHm2)

>Image visualizing Enthusiast Gaming overall structure.

&#x200B;

Currently, the company owns over 100 websites focusing on unique gaming  content (Destructoid, The escapist, Nintendo Enthusiasts, etc), YouTube channels with a combined 24 million+ subscribers (Wisecrack, The Squad, The Count Down, etc),  professional Esports teams such as Luminosity Gaming, influencers across  many different social media platforms, and it was responsible for  hosting live Esports events pre-COVID 19. Taken together, its platforms reach an audience of over 300 million gamers on a monthly basis. Enthusiast's esports subsidiary Luminosity Gaming owns teams  competing in Fortnite, Apex Legends, and a variety of other games. The  company helps Enthusiast get access to its own esports content and gain a  foothold in the $1 bil+ esports market.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

65 million of the 300 million monthly users are located in the U.S.  alone. This is important because when it comes to eventual monetization,  U.S. “eyes” are traditionally those that have the highest value. Half of every American male between the age of 18 and 34 visited at least one of the platforms owned by Enthusiast Gaming. This is an important  demographic, since it is one of the hardest-to-reach ones, and is one  the demographics that spends the most on non-essential goods and has a  larger lifetime value, since they are in the early stages of their  lives. The CEO mentions how 70% of the company's audience is either Gen Z or Millennials, with 65% of its audience spending more than 15  hours a week gaming. 67% of its platform users purchase more than 7 video games every year. Referring back to the importance of this demographic because it is hard to reach; an astounding 48% of Enthusiast Gaming’s audience do not use Facebook. Altogether, the company has amassed an  audience with significant potential for monetization if it is able to  execute on its strategies over the coming years.

Today, Enthusiast  has 110k+ subscribers, mostly from The Sim's Resource, and this number is up 50% YTD, generating slightly less than $2mil in revenue per  quarter. While management has rolled out subscriptions across a few individual  properties like The Sims Resource, Escapist, and Siliconera, they are  working on putting together an integrated subscription that takes  advantage of their ownership across all these properties.

&#x200B;

>There’s a much bigger play that we can offer customers, and we are  spending a lot of time figuring out how to nail it. That’s our approach,  because nobody can offer, the things that we can offer. And so, we  think our best chance for transformative penetration and transformative  growth on the subscription side is an integrated offer.

&#x200B;

As one of the largest content creators in the gaming industry, with ownership of multiple YouTube  channels as well as esports team, it's only natural that Enthusiast  would enter the content licensing space. In the future, esports and  gaming content will replace a good chunk of sports and other content  available on OTT services today, in my opinion, as 60% of Gen Z people  prefer esports over traditional sports. Today, Enthusiast has already licensed out their BCC Gaming content to Samsung's OTT service, and there should be more deals done in the next few years.

After all these monetization streams, Enthusiast is also planning to  monetize through e-commerce and social networking. However, since this  is still several years out, management has not given much detail on  this.

&#x200B;

>And then, down the road, we have more focus on ecommerce and creating  a marketplace, as well as developing a social network, which we’re  pretty excited about.

In addition, recently acquired Omnia Media is a keystone in the YouTube  ecosystem, providing services to over 500 influencers, including  well-known influencers with millions of subscribers. Omnia Media also  owns its own YouTube channels like Wisecrack and BCC Gaming that produce original content.

Overall, gaming is  going to continue its strong growth and Enthusiast is well-positioned to  capitalize on this trend by helping to connect gamers around the world.  In addition, the company is expected to show strong growth over the  next few years yet its valuation is low compared to other gaming  leaders.

**Munich, May 20, 2021:** Lilium GmbH (“Lilium”), positioned to be a global leader in regional electric air mobility with the development of its electric vertical take-off and landing jet (“Lilium Jet”), and Luxembourg-based Luxaviation Group, one of the largest business aircraft and helicopter operators worldwide, today announced that Luxaviation Group plans to support Lilium in building out airline operations in Europe.

Lilium’s vision for a flexible transportation ecosystem is supported by world-class partners. Luxaviation Group brings over 60 years of experience operating passenger service with hundreds of aircraft under management and 10 Air Operator Certificates (“AOCs”) across Europe.

Building on Luxaviation Group's track record, which includes securing the first European Union Aviation Safety Agency AOC approval for a business jet operator, the parties anticipate Luxaviation Group will become responsible for parts of the airline operations being developed by Lilium. This includes securing necessary approvals and managing pilots, which will be trained following a type rating concept developed by Lufthansa Aviation Training, another Lilium partner. As Lilium continues developing its launch networks in Europe for the planned commercial launch in 2024, Luxaviation Group will also work with Lilium on the development of its best-in-class customer experience, built around Lilium’s digital airline platform and the 7-Seater Lilium Jet.

“We are proud to be working alongside Luxaviation Group, a leading operator in the aviation sector with a track record in offering an innovative and customer-focused service, to build out the Lilium network in Europe. This marks a key milestone as we prepare for launch, and we look forward to working together to provide an exceptional airline service for our passengers,” explains Remo Gerber, Chief Operating Officer at Lilium.

Patrick Hansen, Group CEO at Luxaviation Group said: “Electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft will fundamentally change the way we travel, and the Lilium network is poised to be at the forefront of this sea change in aviation”. Christophe Lapierre, Head of Strategy of Luxaviation Group adds: “We are very pleased to have been selected by Lilium to be their partner in aircraft operations. As an early believer in advanced air mobility, we look forward to bringing our experience and credentials to the partnership with Lilium and building out a service that will truly feel like a first of its kind.”

Lilium has previously announced plans for launch networks in Germany through partnerships with Munich, Nuremberg, Dusseldorf, and Cologne/Bonn airports.

AVIR - Atea Pharma

\- Is a biotech company which focuses on oral antiviral drugs, main focuses are covid (e.g. treating people who caught the virus, not the vaccine) which is in Phase 3 of testing (should hear results in the next few months, but already licensed to Roche) and Hep C (much earlier stages). What caught my eyes is that they became profitable this year, and they earnings are estimated to grow massively \~90% and generally seems to have reached all time low of around \~$22 vs an ATH of almost \~$90

CRSR - Corsair

\- Gaming and streaming equiment, another company that seems grossly undervalued. They have had a massive 2020 thanks to Covid which is expected to keep growing as the gaming industry in general.

$RICK is up 435% since last year. They manage up-scale cabarets, strip clubs, and nightclubs. There's no other publicly traded company like it. Until someone comes up with a strip clubs and porn ETF, I'm gonna continue to allocate 5% to it -- my next-highest allocation for an individual security is $AMZN at 2%.

$MORT is ""only"" up 61% but it's still down ~30% since its pre-pandemic high. It's a mortgages REIT. Considering 2/3 millennials don't yet own a home, if mortgage loans and payments never get back to their pre-pandemic levels, we're gonna have bigger problems than an underperforming REIT.

\- I plan on buying $100 every Sunday (worst performing day for that ""stock"").

\- I will only buy below the 50MA. If price on a given Sunday is above, then I will rollover those $100 to the next Sunday, or until price goes under the 50MA.

\- I'll buy $200 instead of $100 if the price is below the 200MA by 25%.

\- I'll buy $400 isntead of $100 if the price is below the 200MA by 50%. I've found that this ""stocks's"" deepest dips are around that price level.

To me it only makes sense to drop interest rates to the negatives so people are forced to spend money or lose it. People aren’t going to spend money when commodity prices are high, so deflation would also prove to be beneficial for the economy IMO.        

How does increased interest rates cause more spending when all it does is cause commodities to go up and force more people to spend significantly less? Negative interest rates are also something that will boost retail growth as retail businesses will be able to borrow money at a negative rate and pay their employees a higher wage to get their business started/back running.

If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I´ll try to answer everything. 

&#x200B;

Today we will look through the basics of Apple´s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for Apple´s stock using discounted free cashflow. 

This is not financial advice and I personally own shares in Apple. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can.

First let´s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **50%** of their sales comes from the **iPhone**. The **Mac** makes up around **11%**, the **iPad** around **9%**, **Services** around **19%** and **Wearables, Home and Accessories** around **11%**. 

For the valuation: 

We take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 8%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for Apple´s stock of **$90 per share**. But because we have to account for **Apple´s debt** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$86 per share**.

Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that. 

Because Apple´s price is higher right now, I don´t think buying more is a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That´s where you invest every month the same amount.

Where I see Apple´s stock price in 5 years. We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$242 per share** which is higher than what it is now. 

What I´ll do. I believe in Apple. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That´s why, although the price is not where I would want it to be, I will continue to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I don´t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm. 

Thank you for reading and I hope I´ll see you again.",nk5zl6,['AAPL'],0

Compared to my current ratio of 98k invested and 2k cash, should I liquidate some positions and go to like an 80/20 ratio...70/30....60/40....etc.

Like I keep hearing that it would be smart to have some dry powder on the side as rates, inflation, supply chain issues, etc, etc, etc make the market volatile. We'll, I know everyone has a different opinion, but no one even mentions what their ratio is and why...

Right now I'm practically fully vested. But I'm debating on cashing out some positions and holding it in cash for upcoming Q3-Q4 plays (or even beyond). I'm really trying to avoid timing the market (even though this is what I'm technically doing), but what's the ""average"" cash position ratio if people are taking the ""dry powder"" route...?

529,2021-05-24,stocks,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 24, 2021**

After weeks of volatility, stocks rallied today as fears over rising inflation forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy tempered. As I have said for weeks, there are several reasons I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, which saw the S&P 500 (SPY) lose 4% in three trading days, was overdone and I am glad to have taken advantage of the dip particularly in technology stocks. The SPY closed 1.01% and is only 3 points away from its all-time high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.68% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed .56% higher. 

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”.

Moreover, while the market was shaken by the April Consumer Index, as has been reiterated in the recap before, the Federal Reserve has consistently said they are looking towards significant progress in the labor market before any significant adjustments to monetary policy are considered. In the Federal Reserve’s April meeting minutes, “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals”.  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered. The April Job Reports showed only 266,000 jobs added back to the economy, widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March, bolsters that argument.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also said a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, it’s important to note the meeting toke place before the release of the April Jobs report, which greatly bolsters Powell and other monetary officials' argument that the labor market remains below the Fed’s targets and roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic times. onth. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.

Michael Jones, CEO of Caravel Concepts said, “I do think it's been a pretty healthy sideways chop. It's taken out some of the speculative excess. The biggest pullbacks have been in some of the most pricey names. That all feels very healthy to me.”

**Highlights**

* The court case between Epic Games and Apple (AAPL) s expected to end this week as both sides prepare closing arguments. As a reminder, Epic Games is accusing Apple of antitrust behavior by taking a 30% commission from sales in the app store and blocking companies from using third-party payment options. Apple says it prevents third-party software to ensure consumer protection and the commission is in-line with other app-store developers, like Alphabet. The result of this case will have very wide ranging implications.
* Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly nearing a deal to buy the Hollywood studio MGM for roughly $9 billion, in a deal that would turn the movie studio into a streaming asset for AMZN. According to people familiar with the matter, a deal could close as soon as next week.
* Investors have rejected a record number of executive compensation plans in non-binding votes of U.S.-listed companies this year, objecting to pay rises and the easing of performance targets in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an analysis by consulting firm ISS Corporate Solutions. I hope this trend continues moving forward and urge shareholders to continue voting no on potential compensation plans. A record 14 S&P 500 companies had more than 50% of investors reject executive pay packages so far this year. 
* Ford Motor Co said on Monday its new electric F-150 Lightning Pro for commercial customers would be available at a starting price of $39,974.

2 Key Things From 3D Systems' Earnings Call That Investors Should Know | NASDAQ

Earlier this month, 3D Systems (NYSE: DDD reported first-quarter 2021 results that easily beat the Wall Street consensus estimates for both revenue and earnings. The stock skyrocketed 35% the next day.

In the first quarter, the 3D printing company's revenue rose 7.7% year over year (and 17% excluding the impact of divestitures to $146.1 million. Growth was driven by continued strength in the healthcare segment and a stabilizing of the industrial segment, which was hard hit by the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.


Moreover, the company posted a profit on both an adjusted basis and according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Adjusted for one-time items, net income landed at $20.9 million, or $0.17 per share, up from a loss per share of $4.5 million, or $0.04 per share, in the year-ago period. GAAP net income was $45.2 million, or $0.36 per share, up from a loss of $18.9 million, or $0.17 per share, in the first quarter of 2020.

Earnings releases tell only part of the story. Following are two key things from 3D Systems' Q1 earnings call that investors should know.

1. The company's competitive advantages
From CEO Jeffrey Graves' remarks:

There are three things that inspire my confidence in our future. And I believe they should inspire yours as well. First, we clearly by far have the broadest technology portfolio in the industry. [...] Second, I'm convinced that we have the brightest and most creative application engineers in the industry. [...]

Third, as one of the largest and most experienced companies in the industry, we have the scale and the infrastructure to not only support our customers' needs when they initially implement additive manufacturing, but also sustain them over the lifetime of their equipment by providing key services and consumables that are vital to their ongoing business success.

As to Graves' first point, 3D Systems does have the broadest offerings in the 3D printing industry in terms of technology to my knowledge, at least among publicly traded companies. It has several polymer technologies and at least one metal 3D printing technology.

For a couple of points of comparison: Rival Stratasys (NASDAQ: SSYS, another well-established pure-play 3D printing company, doesn't have a metal 3D printing technology. Newly public Desktop Metal (NYSE: DM is just in the early stages of commercializing its metal technology and only recently expanded into polymers via its February acquisition of EnvisionTEC.

His second point about having ""the brightest and most creative application engineers"" is too subjective to address.

I'll also agree with Graves' third point about 3D Systems having a scale and experience advantage, at least relative to most other players. That said, there's a caveat here. Under the prior two CEOs, the company prematurely released products that had quality issues. So, while scale does usually provide various advantages, it won't do so if customers are hesitant to buy a product from a company due to concerns about quality. Hopefully, this issue is largely behind 3D Systems, but investors still need to keep an eye on it.

2. Ramping up its healthcare business organically and through acquisitions
From Graves' remarks:

As you can see in our numbers for Q1, we're seeing rising demand for new applications, particularly in our healthcare business. To meet this demand forecast, we're expanding our Denver, Colorado, location by roughly 50%. [...] Through this next phase of investment [...] we'll be able to reduce time to market for new medical applications, continue expanding our product offerings, and better support the holistic needs of our growing healthcare customer base.

In Q1, 3D Systems' healthcare revenue surged 39% year over year to $72.5 million. This segment accounted for 49.6% of the company's total revenue of $146.1 million. So its business is now essentially evenly split between healthcare and industrial.

As Graves said on the prior quarter's call, the company's healthcare business ""brings a bit higher gross margin on average than our industrial business."" So, naturally, it makes great sense to focus somewhat more on applications that are more profitable.

In addition, 3D Systems announced several days before it released its Q1 results that it had acquired Allevi, a small Philadelphia-based bioprinting company. Bioprinting refers to using 3D printing technology to print animal and human cells to produce three-dimensional, functional tissues. This was a smart move and expands the company's involvement in this space, as it's been collaborating with United Therapeutics (NASDAQ: UTHR in this realm since 2017.

Graves said one key intermediate-term application of bioprinting is to help pharmaceutical companies speed up the drug development process. A longer-term goal of those working in this space is to print fully functional solid human organs such as the liver, heart, and kidneys for transplant purposes. Regenerative medicine, as it's often called, is in its infancy, but it has humongous growth potential.

537,2021-05-24,stocks,"Initially, I wanted to come into this post completely unbiased, I wanted to present the bull and bear case and give you a complete overview of sentiment and questioning from both camps, but I couldn’t help myself. Let me say it out loud, SPCE has an argument to make, I’m here to answer the 3 harshest criticisms that I have heard from the easiest to most difficult. No company or stock out there is a guarantee, I am not here to sell SPCE, it is still high risk as before, but that’s the nature of space exploration isn’t it…

Critique #1 - Revenue:  The company has millions in cash, enough to continue burning for 2 years. They plan to generate income via paying customers, astronaut training, low orbit cargo/experiment carry assignments, transportation offerings, and more. If this company doesn’t see future earning possible, why would they move forward to build more ships? Why would they hire more staff? Why would there be 3+ other companies wanting to eat into their market share?? 

Critique #2 - The Competition: “SpaceX and Blue Origin are going to eat the market, leaving SPCE with zero-to-little gains.”

 \#Debunked:  Let’s start with the elephant in the room, SpaceX, Elon Musk has presented concepts for SN high-speed point to point travel, getting anyone from NYC to Shanghai in 4 hours, that sounds wonderful at first but let me tell you 3 points on why this is out of touch. 1. Have you heard the noise created by a SN ship? Do you think that could take off near or within NYC and all its resident would be fine with a bomb like take off? This means they cannot be anywhere near a major city, you would have to travel to a remote place to get on the supposed fast flight… 2 Boarding this “fast flight” requires a suit up, when you get into space launch, you must train to do this, you must wear an astronaut suit, the concept of just passing through security and into your flight seat as a casual experience is unfathomable for the next few years, it’s not going to happen, flights from NYC to Paris cannot happen within minimal hours without so many other factors getting in the way of that time convenience...not in a rocket at least. #3 What is the main objective of SpaceX? Definitely not a relatively small market like space tourism, SpaceX is dealing with developing a system of launch logistics that rival shipping and train systems, they have been assigned to provide a lunar lander, they have the opportunity to secure the largest and most lucrative of satellite launches, and they have tight deadlines if they want to deliver the promise of making humans live on Mars, there is so much more and simply far too important of assignments that SpaceX has in front of it to pivot and go after a smaller market segment like fun filled space tourism. Now let’s talk about Blue Origin, this is VGs biggest rival as of today, but BO is clearing behind SPCE. BO was started with the purpose of getting to the moon and making humans multi-planetary via space hotels, this vision has faded off as of late. BO was in competition with SpaceX for lunar missions and lost coveted contracts to SpaceX, the only reason why BO is in space tourism is because it could not meet its original goals, it’s now pivoting out of necessity, a company mission statement is important, and BO is confused and lost. The experience that they are offing is lesser than what SPCE is proposing, their ergonomics, standard up and down flight experience, the aesthetics of the ship interior and exterior are all subpar in comparison to SPCE. They don’t have an airport to take off from…I could go on all day. VG is founded by Richard Branson, a man with a lifelong experience in hospitality, entertainment, and travel markets, BO is founded by a man who found the cheapest way to ship boxes and cancel mom and pop stores forever, if you pay any attention to the staff of a company before you invest, VG is a no brainer. VG has a CEO and upper level staff with experience in Disney, BO has upper management with experience in mechanical systems….are you noticing a pattern?….

Critique #3 - Death:  I’ve read the comments “this is a disaster waiting to happen”, “they will get canceled when thy kill somebody”….for the record, this is a great critique and justified concern, death of a client would be both heartbreaking for VG and a setback. To answer this we must look no further than other transportation and extreme entertainment industries. Let me ask you, has anyone died on a plane, in a car crash, a motorcycle, perhaps skydiving?...certainly if a death occurs on an SPCE flight due to a crash VG will have legal corners covered.

.....

I do not have a crystal ball, I do not offer financial advice. I just wanted to share because I hear the arguments over and over, anyone out there who is taking interest, now you know, SPCE is real. This company is a retail favorite, love it or hate it, we are all unable to look away… in an era of pent-up travel demand, the roaring twenties can only be ushered in by something as lavish as SPCE, whatever your take, wish them luck.

.....

NOTE: The wealthy pay 50,000+ to scale Mount Everest every year, (Everest is cold, physically demanding, and utterly dangerous) why would they not regularly pay for SPCE?

NOTE: The cost to fly to space was over a million just years ago, VG can fly you up for 250k.",nkbmpp,['SPCE'],0
538,2021-05-25,stocks,"If you do not follow the mortgage sector, RKT is the market leader and reported earnings just 2 weeks ago. Their report was a miss by a penny but still made close to 2 billion dollars as a company. When RKT missed the entire sector dropped drastically. The main stocks that crashed were LDI, HMPT and UWMC. I strongly believe RKT was the culprit. Famous for being short as high as 35% just a quarter ago. I believe the sharks were still nearby and ready. The short % has not been updated since earnings and is at 7%. I believe the new short is once again at 20% or above. The very next day following earnings the rest of the sector has been attacked. The difference with these companies and most stocks, especially tech/growth is they all make serious, serious money!

**LDI makes close to 1 billion a year, just made over 300 million. Announced a special dividend of 200 million or 62 cents a share. They announced a regular dividend per share. The market cap is slightly over 4 billion. Yes, they have a PE ratio of under 4! Cash flows to buy back shares instead of using money for dividends. They have lost over 1.2 billion in market cap since RKT report.**

**HMPT just made 149 million the past 3 months. They have lost over 500 million in market cap since RKT reported. They have not announced a dividend or anything yet. The company trades at 2.5x earnings. They make cash!**

**UWMC, did the right thing makes cash and announced a 300 million buyback. I believe they have smoked out the shorts as it dipped as low as 6.25 and has recovered nicely.**

**RKT makes roughly 8 billion a year! They are valued near 35 billion and have lost over 14 billion since earninings! They last quarter gave out over 2 billion for free via a special dividend of over 1.14 per share. They have 2 billion shares! They make over $4 per share and trade under 17!!!**

LDI trades 200,000 shares daily! The stock is under 14!! Can you imagine a 100 million buyback?? They are giving 100 million via dividend and just gave 200 million special dividend they can do it!

HMPT trades just over 100,000 shares at about 6! Even a 20 million buyback will moon the stock. They just made 149 million the last 3 months!

543,2021-05-25,stocks," **Two things to start:**

1. I am not a financial advisor. What follows in my interpretation after doing much research and consulting with my broker. Consult yours before making any decisions.
2. I own 102,500 shares currently. I really don't care if they go up or down over the next few weeks. They will be worth the same regardless as I plan to hold until the Bankruptcy exit plan is concluded unless the price breaks $12.

**Now, what you came here for:** How much will I be paid for my shares of Hertz when Hertz executes its exit plan?

**There a 3 parts of the pay out:**

**1)** You will be paid $1.53 cash for each share, plus

**2)** Each shareholder will get an equity distribution on a prorated bases of 3% of the total purchase price of the entire company. Roughly $1.00 per share, plus

**3)** Then there are the warrants. A little complicated, but hope you follow. Exact wording from the agreement: ""Each Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholder, has the right, but not the obligation, subject to and in accordance with the Rights Offering Procedures, to be eligible to subscribe for up to one (1) Rights Offering Share per 0.9554 shares of Existing Hertz Parent Interests that it holds, at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, subject to the individual limits included in the calculations in Item 2 of this Subscription Form."" So for example on 100 shares you would get (100/.9554) = 104.6682018002931. Which becomes 104 warrants because all rounding is down downward. Each warrant can then be purchased for $10. Here is the tricky part. You can convert by exercising the warrant, or you can sell the warrant itself. For this example we are going to sell the warrant. And here is why nobody can give you a concrete answer because the value of the warrant is COMPLETE SPECULATION. For my example I am going to assume that the new Hertz, with its reduced debt structure and red hot rental market, will get back to a pre-pandemic level of $20 per share. So you could sell each warrant for a $10 profit. ($20 share price less the $10 warrant purchase.) *Just a note: HTZ traded for as high as $46/share in the good times, which is what the new HTZ will be entering. The good times. Low debt. Hot market.*

**So here is the math on 100 shares:**

1. $1.53 cash out (x) 100 = $153 **+**
2. $1.00 equity distribution (x) 100 = $100 **+**
3. 104 shares times $10 profit **=** $1040

Total income from you 100 shares would be $153 + $100 + $1040 = $1293. or **$12.93/share.**

If you currently owned the 100 shares for todays close price of $6.39 you investment is $639.

So staying it thru until the exit plan concludes and selling your warrants would net you $654 ($1293-$639).

**This is why I say I'm a bull on this stock. I believe that the total value of each HTZGQ share is really somewhere between $13-$20 per share. I will not sell unless the $HTZGQ crosses the $12 line before the exit plan is executed. Most estimates you see assume being able to modestly sell your warrants for about $15 per share. Which means a price of around $7-8 ($1.53+$1+$5 warrant profit=$7.53) is the total value. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SEVERE UNDERVALUE.**

***But regardless, lets just say that the $7-8 is the call. you have a more than 20% upside in the current price of $6.39.***

546,2021-05-25,stocks,"Nautilus, Ticker NLS. This company is about 20% short, has 113 million in cash in the bank with just under 15 million in debt, has a market cap of 500 million. They have generated about 80 million over the past 2 quarters as well. We have a major catalyst still….people aren’t running to the gym. If you go to Nautilus.com you will still see everything is back ordered with 6-8 weeks estimated ship date. The accounts receivables shows near 90 million on orders.

Another major catalyst is Peloton. Peloton is losing money and making a lot of acquisitions, they have spent more than the $500 million (the cost of entire NLS which is profitable). If NLS crushes again, which they will! (The question is what traders do with the report) PTON should use their beefy valuation to make an acquisition which would be immediately accretive to earnings for PTON. PTON is losing money and NLS is making money hands over fists. 

**These are just some of the 1st Quarter 2021 and some 4th Quarter 2020 highlights.**

**1st Quarter of 2021 Net Sales Increased 120% to $206 million, the highest quarterly sales in company history Operating Income of $39.7 million is third-highest in company history EBITDA was $40.4 million compared to $2.3 million last year** 

**1st Quarter of 2021 Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale securities were $113.2 million, an increase of $86.8 million, compared to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $26.5 million as of March 31, 2020.**

**Debt was $13.6 million compared to $28.4 million as of March 31, 2020.**

**Fourth Quarter EBITDA improved by 578% to $40 million compared to same period last year**

**Fourth Quarter Operating Income of $41 million is the second highest since our founding in 1986**

**On a full year**

**Company Achieves Full Year Revenue Guidance by Growing Revenue 79% to $553 million**

**Full Year Operating Income was $78 million and Full Year EBITDA was $84 million (Wait a second at $17 this company trades at $525 million….isnt that just 7x PE)**

So let us recap some of this here. This company which sells BowFlex, Schwinn and other brands is growing 120%, is making serious cash, had the best sales quarter in the company’s history and trades basically near 6PE. This past quarter was the 2nd most profitable quarter in its history after the 4th quarter of 2020. This has pulled back from $30 about 4-5 months ago after 2 amazing reports. You will not find 120% growth in profitable stocks. I understand that eventually maybe 2-4 quarters down the road the growth will slow. But the company has forecast this quarter at 50%....I believe that is modest..

Also, PTON is going to lose about $200 million because of their treadmill fiasco. NLS doesn’t have a fiasco, if anything PTON should plug that issue and make a purchase. PTON with BOWFLEX! The possibilities…

547,2021-05-25,stocks,"Is ARK Invest changing its mind on electric vehicle maker Volkswagen? (VOW, VWAGY)

[VW Outlines the Math Behind Its Autonomous Service Plans](https://ark-invest.com/newsletters/issue-271/?utm_content=168006531&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-2398137084)

> In a recent interview, Klaus Zellmer, Board Member responsible for Sales, Marketing and After-Sales at its passenger car division, said that if Volkswagen launches an autonomous service, it could charge vehicle owners 7 euros per hour and hit profitability. If the cars on its platform were to average 30 miles per hour, vehicle owners would pay 29 cents per mile for the autonomous service in addition to the 70 cents per mile to drive personally owned gas-powered cars today, the two costs summing to roughly $1 per mile. While less expensive than the average taxi today, according to ARK’s estimates robotaxis at scale will be priced profitably at only 25 cents per mile.

> Charging vehicle owners per hour is a telling go-to-market strategy for VW’s autonomous taxi platform. ARK believes that personal car ownership will dwindle, if not collapse, as autonomous taxi networks proliferate and prices drop to only 25 cents per mile. Rarely do taxi rides last an hour or more, suggesting that VW is likely to transition to a per mile price if its autonomous strategy meets with success.

> While it has had some false starts, Volkswagen now seems to be making strides in transitioning from a legacy auto manufacturer to a software enabled, autonomous electric future. ARK will continue to monitor VW’s progress.

Why is ARK Invest still emphasizing autonomous driving technology?

The bull case for Tesla (TSLA) has always been much stronger on the second-life energy storage front than on the autonomous driving technology front.  Only today is Tesla reconsidering its earlier rejection of lidar technology, but that's because there has been a credible embrace of it.

Tesla has made its bet with Luminar Technologies (LAZR) because [Volkswagen has embraced lidar technology and made its bet with Argo AI](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/naooit/electric_vehicle_volkswagen_embraces_lidar_for/).

Nonetheless, just like with Tesla, the [bull case for the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mnxdex/oops_dd_underestimated_volkswagen_by_2025_could/), is, in my opinion, much stronger on other fronts: scale, charging networks, bidirectional charging technology, the company's own planned foray into second-life energy storage, and so on.

548,2021-05-25,stocks,"Some context: I have a Roth (40% of portfolio), 401k (20%), and a taxable account (40%). 

Scenario #1) I like to keep my dividend and REIT stocks in the Roth. Typically, I'm looking for low PE and high yield (typically over 3%, but some in the 4-6% range). Anyway, I've seen a lot of these stocks appreciate significantly. In 2021 alone, I sold positions that appreciated 29%, 15%, and 18% respectively. My thought process was: I bought those stocks with the expectation to make $x return over the next y years in dividends. However, since the appreciation was so good, I hit that goal in just a few months. Sure, the dividends didn't change, but the yield did! So, now instead of getting 3% on my positions, I'm getting somewhere in the twos. Why stick around? So, I move out of those positions into others that can return 3% or more. 

Scenario #2) I try to minimize taxes in my taxable account. For example: A year ago, I had a huge loser. I didn't want to be in that position any more so I sold it. However, I didn't want that loss to go unrewarded so I also sold a winner. I bought the winner right back. The idea was to get a higher cost basis on that stock while still keeping it.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I work for company that is part of large multinational conglomerate that owns many other companies in the same sector. Our parent company is listed on NYSE. However, it is considered low P/E and high dividend value stock that recently got quite expensive so I don't own any stocks of it. Also... knowing how things work from the inside... I actually don't really want to hold any shares of this company... At least not at the current price.

Regarding owning shares its no big deal. We get little training videos about how we are not supposed to trade on insider information and how we are not supposed to trade shares just before and after earnings but other than that, no problem, anyone can own company's shares and I don't think you need to declare anything to HR. Also, we have shares ownership programme where employees are allowed to buy company's share at a discount. I think it's buying shares at cheapest price that quarter or something like that.

568,2021-05-25,stocks,"So I'm quite new at this, started investing like a week before the whole GME thing (unfortunately didn't buy any though). Advice I've gotten has said to buy into the market piece by piece, slowly over time and I've been following it. When it comes to selling I've assumed I'd just sell everything I had in a stock once it went up enough but then I thought ""well what if I sell it off piece by piece"". Specifically I have a +$150 return on 22nd Century Group Inc so I sold $130 worth of it. I figure if it continues to climb sure I'll make a bit less money but if it crashes (which I don't think is likely but you never know) I'll lose less and if it dips but looks like it'll come back up I can use the money from the sale to buy more. I know that sounds like I'm trying to time the market which is foolish but this is motivated more by wanting to actually secure the money I make from my investments rather then watch the money number go up only for it to drop like a rock before I actually get any of it out.

 It's a common mistake even experienced investors mistake. I've made it. I guarantee half the people on here who ridicule others for it, have done it. Millionaires have gone bankrupt through bad investments. It isn't just retail traders and lower/middle class who suffer from it. 

Like a lot of people, I used to say I never invest more than I can afford. I believed it because I wasn't looking at the whole of my financial situation and was ignoring major red flags. It's easy to tell yourself you aren't making such a ""rookie"" mistake while ignoring red flags.  If this might be you, consider simple signs you need to pullback:

- you are constantly watching price fluctuations and agonizing over dips. This happens because you can't afford to lose what you've put in which means you've put too much in. If you're losing too much time during your day watching stock prices and your job isn't a day trader than you need to lower your investment.

- panic selling at even a small loss. Nothing wrong with putting a stop loss in place but if you're putting one in for a small percent drop, chances are you're terrified of losing more than you can afford. Cut down your stake and you'll find you're able to weather the dips long term

- thinking about your investment as ""money you have"" to boost your confidence in your bank account. If you have $2k in your checking account but tell yourself it's OK because you have $10k in stocks, you are way in over your head. 

Here are some tips I've learned along the way that might help some others:

1. Don't beat yourself up too much or lose too much sleep when you realize you're in a hole. Its fixable and with mitigation, you'll be able to climb back out.

2. DON'T double down and try to recoup losses by putting more money you can't afford in. 

3. If you've put in too much and lost a lot, hold past the dip and sell once the stock has recovered to a safe degree. It's extremely rare for a stock to do a permanent  downward slump. Panic selling at the bottom screws you more. If a 50% drop happens and you've lost faith in the stock, wait until it comes up 25% to sell. This obviously is difficult to predict and modular depending on the stock and loss but unless a company is rumored to be going under entirely, you can wait for the buoy.

4. Just because you aren't losing money doesn't mean you aren't over-investing. Even if you're seeing gains but you're living paycheck to paycheck, you are over-invested. Stocks aren't a substitute for a savings account or as a holding place for all your extra funds. Its easy to placate out of that thinking when the going is good but that's how people get royally screwed. Even if it hurts, sell what you need to in order to get right financially. You might see fewer gains but you'll sleep better st night 

5. Make a gated checkpoint system of what you invest. For example, 20% of your paycheck goes into savings. 30% of your monthly savings account goes into investments. Find a number thats safe for you.

6. Last but not least, always imagine your investment is a vacation. A lot of people say ""assume it's money down the drain,"" but I disagree with this from a psychological standpoint. If you're active in trading, it's hard to simply view the money as gone. Imagine you're planning a vacation and the money you're putting in is what you're spending. You obviously want a nice vacation but no one spends their life savings on a vacation (unless you're dying in which case go nuts). Some vacations end up being worth the money and some end up a disappointment, but you don't ruin your financial life by taking a vacation and buying stocks should be no different.

The news in Q1 was mostly about how industrial companies in materials, construction, agriculture, rail, mining, etc. are going to continue to rebound well until about Q4 because of the pandemic recovery, and big tech (NASDAQ) is going to plateau during that time.

The news lately has been mostly about continuous monitoring of the impact of inflation and oil prices on stock prices.

577,2021-05-25,stocks,"Bought AMC back in February when everything kicked off.

I've had a few small OTC stuff with $100 thrown here or there in my account, this was my first foray into the real stock market.

Sold AMC last week at a loss, thought better of it, then bought it back in the dip. Cost basis went up (wash sale), so set a sell limit today and exited AMC when it dropped this morning.

Basically AMC at this point is pump and dump trading by WSB subreddit.

Sold for a loss today because it was tanking pretty hard in the am a few times. My cost basis was adjusted from the wash sale, so total loss playing around with AMC was like $30.  Now it's up to $15+ again this afternoon??? Can't deal lol

Is it often stocks jump by $2-3 in a day at 15% gain/loss when the stock price is in the teens? I think not, unless big news for investors, no major news really for AMC or AMCs business plans so that's why it's mostly pump and dump, or a small squeeze at this point, but short float was 20% as of April 30th with millions of shares sold and bought each day since with probably a constant adjustment of the shorting of the stock going on.

Using this as an overall experience to: 1. Not have paper hands and panic sell at a loss before midday, and most importantly, 2. Don't day trade meme stocks with high volatility of it's value over months.

580,2021-05-25,stocks,"**$TAP**

I only make two or three ""high-conviction"" trades per year. When I trade, I go big with serious conviction. I want to tell you about my biggest trade ever - Molson Coors (3500 shares @ $55.44). I've also got a bunch of options that expire in October.

I am not a ""technical"" trader. Nor am I a ""fundamental"" trader. I'm a guy who follows Chris Camillo & and the Dumb Money ""social arbitrage"" style of investing. Chris has over a decade of 60%+ annual returns. The goal in this style of investing is to find game-changing information about a company that Wall Street doesn't know, research it like crazy, put on a trade, and then wait for the suits on Wall Street to discover the information when the company announces quarterly results. When game changing information is discovered by the suits in New York, they buy like crazy and drive the price up.

If you want to read more ""fundamental"" analysis on $TAP, read [this awesome due diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb868/molsoncoors_beverage_co_tap_dd_reopening_play/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) over on WallStreetBets from u/undream22.

**Background of the Trade:**

Molson Coors is an old company. They make the majority of their money off of cheap beer (e.g. Coors Light, Miller Lite, & Miller High Life). For the last 4-5 years, their stock has sunk because cheap beer is losing market share to hard seltzers and higher margin specialty beers.

Truly & White Claw took over the seltzer market which is growing quickly. FYI - hard seltzer's are way more profitable than beer.

The company got a new CEO who implemented a ""Revitalization Plan"" and is heavily investing in more profitable ""above premium"" beverages to make more money off of their huge distribution network. The important beverages include (but are not limited to) the following:

* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer
* Zoa - Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnston's energy drink
* Vizzy Hard Seltzer

**Thesis of the Trade:**

Molson Coors has three huge winners on its hands ***and Wall Street has no idea***. Once Molson Coors starts reporting actual numbers from Topo Chico, Vizzy, & Zoa at the end of this quarter they are going to crush all the analyst earnings estimates. This will lead to the big boys on Wall Street buying up TAP and driving up the price.

**Why Doesn't Wall Street Know Yet?:**

While the analysts certainly know that Molson Coors is distributing these beverages, they simply don't realize how big of a deal these drinks are. They don't know this because 1) the recent quarterly numbers do not reveal it, and 2) Wall Street doesn't pay attention to store checks, Google Trends, or the power of social media.

Let me explain:

* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer was released to the public on March 29, 2021. This preliminary launch was limited to nine select markets. Two days later, Molson Coors' Q1 ended.  **So, Wall Street doesn't have any actual numbers on Topo Chico Hard Seltzer yet**. I recommend that you listen to the Q1 call (April 29th). In the Q1 call, the CEO only talked briefly about getting unexpected market share in Texas with Topo Chico. However, based on the Dumb Money community channel checks (Check our our Discord group), stores in every market where it was released are selling Topo Chico HS like crazy. Topo Chico is selling as good (if not better) than Truly and White Claw. This is a huge deal. Moreover, Google Trends show people are searching ""topo chico hard seltzer"" more than ""truly hard seltzer"" and more than ""white claw hard seltzer."" That is amazing. And it was only released in NINE markets. It might be way bigger when it gets release to the rest of the country. Finally, #TopoChico is trending on TikTok and Instagram. Don't underestimate the power of social media.
* Zoa was released on February 24th (2/3's into Q1). Aannnddd, it's release was initially limited to online sales and select in-store sales. **Any numbers from Zoa were de-minimis in Q1 results**. They are expanding their distribution, and Dumb Money members are finding it in grocery stores now. Just spend a few minutes looking at the Rocks Instagram feed to see how hard he is pushing this drink. The branding is excellent and he has over 239m followers on Instagram and 15.2 million on Twitter. Google Trends show people are searching ""zoa energy drink"" just as much as ""monster energy drink"" and more than ""red bull energy drink."" Think about that for a second. A bran new energy drink is just as sought after as two established brans that own the market. Again, Don't underestimate the power of the Rock on social media.
* Last quarter Molson Coors had **two** **unexpected events that significantly reduced earnings**. 1). The Texas freeze shut down their biggest manufacturing plant in Fort Worth, Texas, for several days - impacting earnings. 2). They had a cybersecurity event that shut down production even further. Read/listen to the last earnings call to learn more about these two one-off events. This obviously cut into earnings last quarter and yet they still beat estimates. My guess is that so long as they don't have any enormous and unexpected events during Q2, they are going to crush earnings.
* Vizzy was launched in 2020 in the middle of the pandemic. Google Trends shows it is now starting to compete with Truly and White Claw. It is a ""healthier"" hard seltzer because it has vitamins (I guess). This competition came from only one variety pack. They just released a new lemonade version that is getting much higher reviews that competitors. Moreover, Dumb Money store checks show it is selling out in Canada.
* I expected the next two quarters are going to be gangbusters for the entire industry - lifting Molson Coors and all the other alcohol companies. Think about it. The vaccine is highly distributed finally. Summer is coming. So many people are going to have BBQ's, go to baseball games, go on vacations, and just let loose. And it is the summer of hard seltzerI don't think Wall Street understands how big pent-up demand is for having a good time. Alcohol is going to flow this summer unlike anytime we've ever seen before. TAP is the ultimate recovery play.
* From a fundamental analysis, TAP is highly undervalued in comparison to its competitors. Just take some time and look at $BUD, $SAM, $STZ and you'll see what I mean. Again, if you want to read more ""fundamental"" analysis on $TAP, read [this awesome due diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb868/molsoncoors_beverage_co_tap_dd_reopening_play/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) over on WallStreetBets from u/undream22.

Anyway, I'm tired of typing now. That is my trade. I hope someone appreciates this write-up.

Three final things:

1. If you want to know more about Chris Camillo, YouTube his famous Bloomberg interview. Also, he was recently featured in a recent ""Unknown Market Wizards"" book by Jack Schwager. Oh, and he wrote his own book back in the day called ""Laughing at Wall Street."" It's a great read.
2. I also HIGHLY recommend watching Dumb Money Live's episode on YouTube called ""Going ALL IN on $TAP""
3. I also HIGHLY recommend watching an older Dumb Money Live episode called ""Billion Dollar Energy Drink? Investing in ZOA from Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson""

585,2021-05-25,stocks,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 25, 2021**

Stocks traded mostly sideways today, managing to mostly hold on to recent gains, despite new data on consumer confidence coming in below expectations. After the volatility experienced in the first few weeks of May, recent price action has been more encouraging to me. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.2% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.15% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.22% down. 

Today, the Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. 

A separate report by Standard & Poor’s said that its S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index posted an annual gain of 13.2% in March up from 12% in February and marking 10-straight months of acceleration in home prices. The results far outpaced analysts’ expectations of a 12.5% annual gain, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. According to a recent Reuters poll, U.S. house prices are forecast to outpace GDP growth and consumer inflation — rising at a blistering pace to average 10.6% this year, almost double the 5.7% predicted in February. With demand rising faster than supply, it is not surprising to see home prices surging forward, with economists expecting the growth to taper once supply rises to meet demand. Total housing inventory at the end of April was 1.16 million units, down 20.5% from one year ago — the lowest level since NAR started tracking homes for sale in 2011. Inventory, however, was up 10.5% from March, an indication that homebuilding is picking up.

Today, members of the Federal Open Markets Committee reiterated their stance that the Fed was not yet worried about rising prices forcing the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

**Highlights**

* [U.S. new home sales pulled back less than expected in April over March,](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-home-sales-fell-5-140851441.html) even as rising prices, tight inventory began to ripple through the housing market. New home sales fell by 5.9% in April over the previous month, giving back some of March's 7.4% gain, [the Commerce Department said Tuesday](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf). Consensus economists were looking for a drop of 7%
* The Washington DC’s Attorney General filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.com Inc. on Tuesday, alleging the company blocks sellers on its marketplace from offering lower prices elsewhere to stymie competition
* Reddit-stocks like Gamestop (GME) and AMC are once again on the move higher.
* The court case between Epic Games and Apple (AAPL) s expected to end this week as both sides prepare closing arguments. As a reminder, Epic Games is accusing Apple of antitrust behavior by taking a 30% commission from sales in the app store and blocking companies from using third-party payment options. Apple says it prevents third-party software to ensure consumer protection and the commission is in-line with other app-store developers, like Alphabet. The result of this case will have very wide ranging implications.
* Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly nearing a deal to buy the Hollywood studio MGM for roughly $9 billion, in a deal that would turn the movie studio into a streaming asset for AMZN. According to people familiar with the matter, a deal could close as soon as next week.
