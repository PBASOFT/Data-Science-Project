The reverse split takes those four shares away and you now have one. Your position value stays about the same, so that one share is worth 1.76.  

Now, like others have said, a reverse split sends a bad signal, so the price often drops again once the market opens.  

I think the important point to remember (ELI5), is that if you had four shares yesterday you only have one now.  So your position is not worth $7 like you might assume.",gykd1ld,t1_gyjqv2f,[],0

Drill contractor and program should be announced an day now and then work will begin.

Often after a reverse split it will slowly drift down for a period until there is some news or catalysts that will drive it. I would think if they had those coming though they might have waited to do the reverse split. The fact they didn't do 10 to 1 is a good sign though as they could have cut it a lot more for a much higher price so that tells me they don't expect to have a lot of price reduction going forward. My best advice is that, if the company's story and driving value have not changed then the company still should do what you expect it too.

585,2021-05-18,pennystocks,"Yeah. It's overpriced right now, but has noticeable upside. Just like any penny stock, it's a gamble. No one knows where it goes from here. Pure speculation play. This isn't an ""actual"" investment into the company based on fundamentals. It's based on market shenanigans and influence (which doesn't make the play invalid...it just means that it's a ""market"" play based on shorting suspicion and activity).

Don't YOLO, but feel free to satisfy your FOMO. That's how I view any ""penny stock."" It shouldn't be viewed as a way to make bank (that's what wealth management is...and penny stocks and wealth management should never be used in the same sentence). This is more in line with tossing a few chips in at the blackjack table after seeing a few hands of low cards come out and hoping your hand gets a double royal (20)).

Problem is that the dealer can also get 20 or 21 and it's a wash. It's a gamble. But it's the cost of being able to play the game.

My FOMO always takes over, but I keep it in check by only making small plays at a time. This one might be a couple hundred shares ($500-$1000) and it gives me something to follow.",gykp2nb,t1_gyjasr4,[],1

958,2021-05-18,pennystocks,"I was considering selling at $1.80 when it briefly stayed there for a day lol. 

Good angle, I would have liked to do swing trading but I feel like I wouldn't have been able to time the dips because it was very volotaile at a certain point and I was super busy with work.

I've been buying since last year and haven't sold. My average is around $1 now and I still have high hopes. Wish I bought all last week though but its cool hindsight is 20/20. 

I think they are finally going to pump it. Let's see what happens but needless to say I've been holding this bag for a while.",gyln7ad,t1_gyliew6,[],0
