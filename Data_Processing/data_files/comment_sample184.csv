At the same time this is also one of the worst ‚Äúclose calls‚Äù videos I‚Äôve seen where the car continues to make mistakes much more often than I‚Äôve seen in the past and the driver really does not give the car a chance to correct itself as he takes over control way to quickly.

Sure, Paysafe is currently not profitable right now; but if Bill Foley manages to do 1/10th of the job he did at Fidelity National, PSFE should be worth more than 8.6B $, no?

VWR and Fisher (owned by TMO) are the most commonly used catalog services for consumables, but that doesn't mean they make all of them. Corning and BD, as well as brands owned by Thermo like Pyrex and Nalgene, are big in lab plastics and glassware. For chemicals, in addition to Fisher and J.T. Baker (owned by TMO and AVTR respectively), MilliporeSigma (Merck KGaA outside the US) is huge and there are a lot of smaller brands. For things like gloves and paper products, it's mostly KimTech (a Kimberly-Clark brand). For more specialized things there's always a variety of providers. Eppendorf is synonymous with microcentrifuge tubes. Cytiva (Danaher), MiliporeSigma, and BioRad are big providers of chromatography resins and Repligen has kind of cornered the market on prepacked columns. Filters vary based on types with the workhorse ones mostly provided by MilliporeSigma or Sartorius in my experience. I've mostly seen depth filters from 3M, viral filters from MilliporeSigma or Asahi Kasei, and TFF filters from Pall (also Danaher).  

I'd also say that you're simplifying the equipment space, particularly downplaying how big Danaher is (especially since the Cytiva acquisition). Mettler Toledo definitely deserves a mention for scales, pipets (Rainin is one of their brands), and pH meters. Sartorius also makes equipment of larger scale for manufacturing.

Both scenarios would effectively, but not officially, make the company a CCP asset.

63,gz66dt0,2021-05-23,t1_gz5wjzg,stocks,"Yes I have. Im fairly new to trading (little over 2 years) but I have never done DD on any stock like I have done with GME. I get a lot of my information from r/superstonk, but I check everything, try my best to sniff out the bullshit, and come up with my own analysis. 

GME is just an anomaly, can we agree on that? I mean just with the baby squeeze (my opinion) then the drop down to $38, and then the rush back up to $347, and now we sit here at the $175 range. Its just crazy!

If it were a constant pump and dump by HF why would they not drop the price down to $40 again or lower than that even? Why stop at the $135-150 area? I mean its profitable but not close to what they have been used to, plus if you believe the news (I dont) they lost almost a billion last week alone. They seem to be losing money, not making money. So that theory just doesn‚Äôt add up IMO.

From the DD that has been found on R/superstonk, you can see that HF can hide true SI in put options. So the true SI is only known by the shorters. I believe whole heartedly they never covered, and that the 140% they initially reported was much lower than the true SI. 140% being the highest allowed SI that can be reported. I mean an increase to $500 could be a squeeze but with Reported SI being 140%, I just dont believe they were covering their position all the way up to $500. Look at past squeezes, last year DGAZF had a short squeeze with an SI of 45% and the price rose from $125 to $25k in less than a week. Look at the Volkswagen squeeze in ‚Äò08. They admitted in the first congressional hearing that if the buy button was not turned off that the price would have hit the $1000s. 

You really cant deny the blatant manipulation that has gone on with GME. From the articles being released of sudden drops, before those drops happen to RH and other brokers restricting trading, is just mystifying. Just look into naked short selling, and the power they have. http://www.gilmermirror.com/view/full_story/27799969/article-Video--The-Wall-Street-Conspiracy--Full-Movie-Free-Online-With-Permission-of-Owner-?instance=news_special_coverage_right_column

I mean take the squeeze out of the equation here. All signs point towards a crash coming. GME has a negative beta. Wouldn‚Äôt that be a safe hedge against the upcoming crash? That coupled with Ryan Cohen and the team he has put together at GameStop, you have to admit it would be hard to bet against him at this point. 

Maybe Im wrong, and Im not denying that could be a possibility, but theres just to much going on here in plain site for me not to smell some bullshit and fuckery going on. Do I think the price will hit the millions? Probably not. I believe it has infinite potential, and I will be holding X amount of shares to see if that comes to fruition. I do believe though that we will see a true short squeeze, and I have my own exit strategy. Seeing how I bought the majority of my shares at $45 I have been in the green for a couple months now and nowhere near my cost basis. Time will tell. June 9th is not far off my friend :)",['GME'],0

The entire point to ""cloud"" is you can leverage the cloud provider network for easy scaling. Otherwise its really no different than a traditional setup. But governments have unlimited funds, value security over efficiency and their scale is limited to their own country and possibly a few other nodes.

In other words, government moving to 3rd party services will be limited. You are asking them to risk security (more eyes who can see data) for convenience... governments generally dont do that except for less important data. For instance when I worked for them, they would use 3rd party servers like the monthly defac menu or for sports events or sales at the local retail store. But nothing vital ever leaves the military networks.

Right, this just isn't true from a corporate lending perspective. Investors are not purchasing new debt at anything considered close to friendly rates for companies that are either defaulting on their debt or over leveraged to the point where they're no longer considered investment grade.

This makes or breaks your whole argument. YouTube is filled with self proclaimed influencers ""teaching"" options and DD without even passing third grade maths.

Compare to a book in a library. If you go to the economics sections you'll find *knowledge*. Each book has to be accepted and publishes which weeds out the worst, further more the writer and their skillet is usually presented. Old books only renin on shelf if they have *solid information* otherwise they get replaced. In a library you'll never look for ""option trading for beginners"" and find a book written by Pussy_Slayer88, but you'll find him on YouTube with millions of views. Millions who took his word for truth and ""learnt"" from a charlatan.

216,gz6iw3a,2021-05-23,t1_gz6exem,stocks,"It seems like you‚Äôre on the right path. I do similar things like you said analyzing the company, industry and competitors. 

I personally also do financial modelling to map out price targets a few years out (my targeted holding period). I won‚Äôt say they are accurate, but they give a rough estimate of what you can expect if the company meets your projections. 

I use multiples based on current and historical data and sometimes average them to get a final multiple as ‚Äúbase case‚Äù (assuming the multiples in the future will remain the same as multiples I calculated). Atm the multiples are usually on the higher side, so if there are high multiples, I might make an average excluding those years (2020/2021). 

Projected growth I usually use based on historical growth. If it‚Äôs not consistent, I look towards their annual reports, meetings, analyst projections and see if those align. I might gather these and then make my own projection on a more conservative rate ( better to be conservative imo). 

Current quarterly reports I usually update into my financial model to see if they are on track with my target and if not they‚Äôre adjusted. 

I do this with all the companies I own and in my watchlist. I also do this as a way to skim through companies to see if they might be worth investing if they are cheap. It takes a bit of work in the beginning, but if you can consolidate everything into 1 excel file to make a dashboard, you can keep a good eye on all your other excels and see if there are good opportunities during corrections. It might be a lot of work for some, but it‚Äôs something I like doing on my spare time. 

Just like to also note that what I do isn‚Äôt necessarily the ‚Äúright way‚Äù to analyze a company. Analyzing a company and investing is more of an art than a science because there are so many ways to get a ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù answer to investment decisions.",[],1

Volatility drag affects all instruments. Assuming a normal ticket with 1x leverage such as QQQ has a 3% loss it needs about a 3.4% gain to fully recover from the loss. This drag is further pronounced with TQQQ as a larger loss needs an even larger gain to recover from. This isn't just a downside though as consistent daily positive returns will have a larger than 3x total return.

Assume QQQ starts at 100 and has two 3% days in a row 

QQQ would return $106.09 for a 6.09% return while TQQQ would return $118.81 for a 18.81% gain which is greater than 3x6.09. 

In addition TQQQ primarily used total return swaps which do not have time decay but have a fixed fee associated with them.

""Once the short seller borrows the shares from the lender and then sells them back into the market, the new owner of the shares is free to lend them out, just as the previous owner did, and have no idea they are on the other side of a short sale

Settlement time is two days after the transaction. In that time, the same shares can be lent out again, and again. This makes it possible, on paper, for more than 100% of the float of a stock to be shorted.
According to financial analytics firm S3, GameStop's peak short interest was 141.8% of its float on Jan. 4.
S3 argued in a recent research note that the traditional method of calculating the percentage of float is flawed because it uses stale data. U.S. investors are required to mark their shares shorted and regulators report these figures twice a month, with a 10-day delay, S3 said.""",[],0

There has been zero evidence of naked shorting.  If you borrow shares to short a stock it is not naked shorting.  Failure to deliver does not necessarily mean naked shorting occurred. It can also occur if you sell your shares that your broker has loaned out and they cannot get the shares back in time for settlement.  Eventually the person they loaned them to has to close their position if they cannot locate other shares to return.  I bring up failure to deliver because that is what all the conspiracy minded people bring up as proof of naked shorting and GME had a high rate of failure to deliver (mainly because the volume was such a high % of the float at the same time the short interest was so high).  I am not saying that naked shorting doesn't happen but it does not happen as frequently as people on reddit think it does.  The fact that you think they can do it legally through loopholes would mean that it would not be illegal.  Those loopholes you describe are what makes the shorts not actually naked.,['GME'],0

So I started exploring different airlines, looked at American and united, looks like United might be a better bet.

But to go along with the airlines, if they start flying, they're going to start ordering airplanes... So I chose to invest in things related to the purchase of new aircraft.  I chose to go after boeing, and whenever there's a few dollars left in my brokerage account, I buy a few shares of Rolls-Royce.

Boeing has had an order of f-15ex aircraft for the United States Air force, an order of f-15QA for the Qatar Air Force, an option exercised on 15 more refueling aircraft for the Air Force, and a contract for up to 60 commercial aircraft... Along with a bunch of maintenance and logistic contracts.

Rolls-Royce is in the running for the contract for re-engineing the B-52 aircraft, supposed to happen second half of this year. If they win that contract, should be 600 plus engines for that.

It is evident that since the pandemic began, enthusiasm for having these stocks has skyrocketed. There are several reasons for this that make sense, including increasing earnings, but a large component is speculative fervor on the part of new tech- and gaming-happy investors, IMO. Keep in mind that these companies likely enjoyed increased profits because of the stay-at-home lifestyle as of late, and it's hard to imagine that the trends will continue upward at a similar rate as the pandemic wanes. It's not as if people are buying new GTX's or processors every year. You could say that these companies, particularly NVDA, are priced for perfection. There's simply not much juice left to squeeze out of them at this point, IMO. That's why I would just wait for a better opportunity.

Next, you use that XYZ$100 to purchase a share of ABC.ETF, conveniently priced at XYZ$100 per share (or, equivalently, US$100 per share).

Suppose that, for various economic reasons, the exchange rate falls to US$1 = XYZ$2 over the time during which you hold your share of ABC.ETF. 

Let's say the value of a share of ABC.ETF  increases to US$150. Due to the currency exchange rate, that share is now worth US$150 \* (XYZ$2 / US$1) = XYZ$300. Because you not exposed to XYZ$, the nominal value of your investment tripled.

What if the value of a share of ABC.ETF had dropped to US$75, losing a quarter of its value relative to US currency? It would be worth US$75 \* (XYZ$2 / US$1) = XYZ$150. Even though the value of your investment fell relative to the US$, the nominal value of your investment still increased in XYZ$, because you were sheltered from currency fluctuations while invested in ABC.ETF.
