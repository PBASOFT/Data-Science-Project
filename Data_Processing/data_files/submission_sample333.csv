139,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"Before I say anything and you ape crustfucks bend me over in the comments - I believe $AMC is about to fly. This post isn't intended to draw away from that, just an opportunity that I see and would like to share. This play is based on $AMCs undoubtable liftoff to $30+.

AMC READY TO FLY.

Plenty of DD has been done on AMC and why its going to take off - I'm not here to talk about that. It is coiled, has popped, and is ready to rip a new butthole in the sky.

&#x200B;

$CNK is AMCs largest competitor and is in the great business we know as movie theaters. When AMC last went crazy, CNK ran up over 56% in a few days from 22-27 of January to $27+. In the past month, AMC is up over 50%. CNK is roughly even. It is lagging behind and is due for a major pop on this AMC craze. It is a classically more boring stock that takes a big nudge to move.

Breaking out similar to AMC. Insanely strong volume shelf in low 20s (high demand) and above 1D 21MA. RSI has lots of room to run. 

**MARGIN**

CNK has a much lower implied volatility and actually allows for margin borrowing. This could be attractive depending on your risk appetite

**DILUTION/FINANCIALS**

CNK has almost no share dilution since the pandemic started, and it has been historically stronger than AMC from a traditional (retarded) financial perspective. AMCs market value growth has passed CNKs by many multiples over the past year. No reason she can't get some love.

Don't overthink it. We love this guy. Fuck you and lets make some money:

144,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"Ok so I was long RKT since IPO. I recently doubled down and bought 100 option contacts for $0.64 at the most recent dip after earnings. I have 300 shares and 100 contracts call for Jan 2022 strike $33.

Is UWMC that much better that I should ditch RKT? If so please explain.

I know RKT guidance is down but 


- the P/E ratio of under 7 is extremely cheap

- They have a great current ratio

- They are profitable which is great during inflation times like now. Revenue and earnings are steady in guidance for the next two years 

- Possible addition to S&P 500

- Dominant name in the industry


This is a conversation around fundamentals. If UWMC is a pure short squeeze I understand but I think RKT is so much better than it’s valued or forecasted to perform relative to other stocks in the broader market. Also I’m not a hater I think both stocks (RKT and UWMC) can do great over the next 5 years.",nf1xrj,[],1

146,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"As many are aware, the 13F for Michael Burry’s hedge fund was released on Monday. His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that’s why I’m not Dr. Burry. I’m sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I’m posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I’m missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn’t detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I’m thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT. The fed claims this inflation is transitory, but I don’t think anyone on the street buys it. I think rates have to come up at least a little bit sometime between now and next January.

If there’s anything else I should be considering for this trade please comment, I’m interested in hearing other opinions on this.

The first known instance of the word ""meme stocks"" in the legal lexicon. Consolidated on April Fool's day, 2021.

If you read those footnotes, you can see that some judges on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (which is 7 very qualified federal judges) have recused themselves and others have had to renounce their claims (normal for judges) against the defendants to even participate, as they would have been members of the several putative actions.

1.**The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets—i.e., much more dollar printing.**

**Let me dig in !**

The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion.

NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over “confidence” index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *“actually”* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *“demand”* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ew6w5tu19vz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bba4677ec15d513e78d6d19644722b133068a48

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***“pulled forward”***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***“costs”*** **of** ***“long-term employment”*** **for a** ***“short-term”*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.** Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bcfon349vz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b498f76db582407f08e593e10dc5692e6005f2

 

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w1cuikh69vz61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b01f66a5badd3fc80e79abecd97096e309324a5

 

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it’ll be worse than expected:**

We finally got “official” confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It’s not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don’t hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time—i.e., the CPI is likely going even higher. 

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a “return to work bonus” in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one’s wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact. Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. For Silver q2 /2021 my targets are 42 Usd /ozz while gold 1.900 Usd/ozz .

GOOD JOB! TAX THE SHORTS! 

The 7.50c line held strong and the stock kept the Friday gains and pushed a bit more.

UWMC is obviously picking up some steam here on Reddit with spillover into many other stock-related platforms (yahoo, twits, alpha, etc). That chatter will certainly help continue the push.

Up some change in Pre-market for what it's worth but should only get better throughout the day.

This is a powder keg ready to go as soon as the 9c's go in the money. If we can exercise at 7.50 and 9 (EXERCISE FRIDAY 5/21 IF YOU CAN FRONT THE Cash!!!).

I suggest exercising even if you are 0.01$ ITM.

The Volume 05/17 was impressive at 17M (8M average) so there is certainly upwards pressure due to buying volume.

Another 2 days like yesterday and those 9c start printing, then it is really off the races and not messing with 8,10% and instead watching a serious gap UP.

Hopes some powder was saved for the push to 9c . I will be buying a few more shares today once some other options are sold for liquidity.

Position:I am loaded up on 6/18 8c and LEAPS. I still really like UWMC long-term but this short-term profit potential is simply staggering.

UWMC looks really good for breaking 9 by Thursday, we already have the 7.50c's ready to print from the push last week, then it's TO THE MOON as those options are exercised. 9c needs to hit this week to hit 12-14 (minimum) next week.

One major risk factor is the fact that BIDU owns 53.08% of IQ, and even more worrisome is that about 30% of BIDU’s revenue in 2021 stems from IQ. Whether or not China will intervene to prevent the plunge in value of its own version of Google is unknown, but is certainly a risk that should be hedged against.

&#x200B;

What is IQ?

iQIYI Inc is an online entertainment service provider in China and it is known as the ""Netflix of China"". It is valued at around 10 billion dollars currently. It is primarily engaged in providing a variety of services encompassing internet video, live broadcasting, online games, online literature, animations, e-commerce and social media platform. The company produces original video content and distributes appealing professionally-produced content, partner-generated content, and user-generated content. It also offers a diverse collection of internet video content that appeals to users from broad demographics. The company's revenue is generated from membership services and online advertising services. The company earns the majority of its revenue from China. The company is based in Beijing and is partly owned by Baidu, the ""Google of China"". It had its IPO in 2018 and is currently sitting at around $13.3 per share.

&#x200B;

How is IQ 2021 Q1 financial report?

Total revenues reached RMB8.0 billion (US$1.2 billion), representing a 4% increase from the same period in 2020 and beat the estimate of $1,180,000,000.

Membership services revenue was RMB4.3 billion (US$658.1 million), representing a 7% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the decline of our subscribing members from 118.9 million as of March 31, 2020, which was a high base due to the impact of Covid-19, to 105.3 million as of March 31, 2021. Our subscribing members grew 3.6 million quarter-on-quarter due to the strong content launch coupled with the holidays in the first quarter, during which people spent more time viewing content.

Online advertising services revenue was RMB1.9 billion (US$292.5 million), representing a 25% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the rebound of both brand-advertising budgets and the number of brand advertisers amid the macroeconomy recovery.

Content distribution revenue was RMB779.1 million (US$118.9 million), representing a 29% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by more content titles we distributed to other platforms during the quarter.

Other revenues were RMB961.0 million (US$146.7 million), representing a 10% increase from the same period in 2020, primarily due to the growth of certain business lines.

Cost of revenues was RMB7.1 billion (US$1.1 billion), representing a 10% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to less content costs and bandwidth cost during the quarter. Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB5.4 billion (US$829.6 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to decline of licensed content cost.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB1.2 billion (US$183.3 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. This was primarily attribute to less provision for credit losses, which was a result of improved macroeconomic environment versus the same period last year.

Research and development expenses were RMB672.3 million (US$102.6 million), representing a 1% decrease from the same period in 2020.

Operating loss was RMB1.0 billion (US$154.8 million), compared to operating loss of RMB2.2 billion in the same period in 2020. Operating loss margin was 13%, compared to operating loss margin of 29% in the same period in 2020.

Total other expense was RMB222.4 million (US$34.0 million), compared to total other expense of RMB628.5 million during the same period of 2020. The year-over-year variance was mainly due to less foreign exchange loss.

Loss before income taxes was RMB1.2 billion (US$188.7 million), compared to loss before income taxes of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020.

Income tax expense was RMB20.6 million (US$3.1 million), compared to income tax expense of RMB4.8 million in the same period in 2020.

Net loss attributable to iQIYI was RMB1.3 billion (US$193.4 million), compared to net loss attributable to iQIYI of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020. Diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS was RMB1.61 (US$0.25) for the first quarter of 2021, compared to diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS of RMB3.92 in the same period of 2020.

As of March 31, 2021, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB13.3 billion (US$2.0 billion).

&#x200B;

Financial Guidance

For the second quarter of 2021, iQIYI expects total net revenues to be between RMB7.21 billion (US$1.10 billion) and RMB7.65 billion (US$1.17 billion), representing a 3% decrease to a 3% increase year over year. This forecast reflects iQIYI's current and preliminary view, which may be subject to change.

Price Target

If we use Netflix valuation as a benchmark. We can estimate the fair market value of IQ being at least equivalent to NFLX at 216B ($480/share). However, I personally think IQ should garner less since it main business is in China while Netflix is in America, Canada, Europe, you name it. Also, the subscription member of Netflix is about 207 million while IQ has only half of it, which is 105 million. Also, the member revenues of Netflix is about 24.7 billion, while that of IQ is only 4.3 billion. IQ has only about 18% of revenues of Netflix and so give IQ an $86/share target price. But my price target for the entire company is at least $200/share as it has half of the membership service of Netflix and it is still growing for IQ. Also, there is a large room of growth for IQ as it mainly focus on mainland nowadays but it will sure expand its business overseas",nfbmkd,[],0
158,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"This pure focus on wholesale means UWMC does not spend as much cost on the servicing and advertising necessary to sustain a large retail business like for RKT. Overall, UWMC actually has had consistently higher net income margin than RKT, currently sitting at 68% vs. 58% for RKT.

UWMC's focus on wholesaling and working entirely with brokers makes it much easier for it to pivot to home purchase originations, which Freddie Mac actually predicts will grow 16% by 2022. Home purchases are more complex than refinances and the value of using a broker shines in those cases. In fact, UWMC is already more heavy on home purchases than its competitors. In the most recent quarter, 25% of its volume came from home purchases. Furthermore, a rise in interest rates may actually benefit UWMC in that the value of the loans they generate will be higher due to the higher cash flows.",nfbwv5,[],0

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a **fantastic setup**.

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

162,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"[Here](https://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/isa-furthers-its-partnership-with-beyond-meat-with-the-certification-of-the-new-iteration-of-the-beyond-burger) is one of the many articles stating that as of today BYND burgers are now HALAL certified.   


If you don't know what Halal is or why this is relevant then you are probably not Muslim or Hindu. The certification will now give BYND a huge customer base boost in my opinion. Impossible Burgers did this in 2018 so the alternative meat market in the UAE has already been introduced. I think BYND is set to capitalize on this new certification especially as meat markets are already negatively impacted from COVID issues.   


$BYND also is sitting >20% short float so any upward movement in this stock could potentially start a quick move up. The stock is sitting near $100 and to me looks to be at a nice floor psychologically ($100 is a nice round bottom for people to buy near).   


Finally the OATLY IPO is coming quick. The alternative meat / protein space will likely be the talk of the town at near the end of the week which may bring BYND up or down with it as the IPO happens. The good ole sympathy trade...   


Disclosure: No I'm not muslim / hindu but I do have family that is. This certification gives them ""confidence"" that during the holidays they can still eat this food. It also allows them to serve this food at events, which is something I know has been an issue in the past for us personally. If it's not Halal it won't be served at a party / event.",nfh8o2,[],1

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit’s Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‘buy’ recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

Corn the US crop that has had its highs and lows over a long history but continues to have massive demand worldwide for a variety of uses and it is not slowing. Instead, weather risks, drought risks, execution risks, and other supply chain bottlenecks have impacts on the prices in the short and mid term and sometimes the long term. 
BEFORE you make any investment decision in Corn, let’s run through these important things:
1. WHO grows corn?
The 2 leading producers of corn include the US at 1 and China at 2 that is over 50% of total production. 
2. WHO consumes Corn?
Well… it’s The US and China accounting for over 50% of total consumption

5. Risks?
As with every investment there is always downside risk! The downside risk here could be from many different factors, however, these are less likely and at current corn prices already priced in. 
These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil. 
-The absence of supply chain disruptions which, let’s face it, is not the theme so far in 2021.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

Joe Atk

16 hours agoWhen Stankey (ATT CEO) asked for a salary increase, the shareholders rightly said ""NO"", as he hadn't proven himself yet. What's becoming clear is that he threw a tantrum and unwound a deal by his predecessor for an eye watering loss, then informed the shareholders they would be on the hook for the poor decision financially by shouldering a dividend cut. Investors still don't know the details of the deal, nor were they able to vote on it (getting their hand smacked again for voting against a salary increase for Stankey). The whole thing seems shady, slimy, and smacks of robbing shareholders to pay for poor management decisions that cost billions. But, hey...Stankey sure got the shareholders back for not allowing a few lousy extra million on his pay stub.  Not to mention that Stankey was the former CEO of WarnerMedia. He's completely spun off his wheelhouse, his main area of expertise, to take T back to being a phone company. Stankey has yet to prove he knows anything about telecom.  A potential investor looking at AT&T should think long and hard before entrusting their resources to current leadership at T. Not only would it be a bad idea to place hard earned funds at the mercy of an imperious, vindictive man-child CEO, but the quality of the bad deals made just in the past five years is staggering and directly reflected in the current share price. At the moment, T is simply an all-round rotten deal that would be best avoided.",ng2nap,[],0

His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that’s why I’m not Dr. Burry. I’m sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I’m posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I’m missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn’t detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I’m thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT. The fed claims this inflation is transitory, but I don’t think anyone on the street buys it. I think rates have to come up at least a little bit sometime between now and next January.

1.**The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets—i.e., much more dollar printing.**

**Let me dig in !**

The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion.

NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over “confidence” index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *“actually”* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *“demand”* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ew6w5tu19vz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bba4677ec15d513e78d6d19644722b133068a48

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***“pulled forward”***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***“costs”*** **of** ***“long-term employment”*** **for a** ***“short-term”*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.** Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bcfon349vz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b498f76db582407f08e593e10dc5692e6005f2

 

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w1cuikh69vz61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b01f66a5badd3fc80e79abecd97096e309324a5

 

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it’ll be worse than expected:**

We finally got “official” confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It’s not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don’t hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time—i.e., the CPI is likely going even higher. 

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a “return to work bonus” in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one’s wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact. Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. For Silver q2 /2021 my targets are 42 Usd /ozz while gold 1.900 Usd/ozz .

GOOD JOB! TAX THE SHORTS! 

The 7.50c line held strong and the stock kept the Friday gains and pushed a bit more.

UWMC is obviously picking up some steam here on Reddit with spillover into many other stock-related platforms (yahoo, twits, alpha, etc). That chatter will certainly help continue the push.

Up some change in Pre-market for what it's worth but should only get better throughout the day.

This is a powder keg ready to go as soon as the 9c's go in the money. If we can exercise at 7.50 and 9 (EXERCISE FRIDAY 5/21 IF YOU CAN FRONT THE Cash!!!).

I suggest exercising even if you are 0.01$ ITM.

The Volume 05/17 was impressive at 17M (8M average) so there is certainly upwards pressure due to buying volume.

Another 2 days like yesterday and those 9c start printing, then it is really off the races and not messing with 8,10% and instead watching a serious gap UP.

Hopes some powder was saved for the push to 9c . I will be buying a few more shares today once some other options are sold for liquidity.

Position:I am loaded up on 6/18 8c and LEAPS. I still really like UWMC long-term but this short-term profit potential is simply staggering.

UWMC looks really good for breaking 9 by Thursday, we already have the 7.50c's ready to print from the push last week, then it's TO THE MOON as those options are exercised. 9c needs to hit this week to hit 12-14 (minimum) next week.

LETS GET FUCKING PAID!

430,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"Disclaimer and Risks: This is not a financial advice. Be cautious to bet against Winnie the Pooh🐻. One major risk factor is the fact that BIDU owns 53.08% of IQ, and even more worrisome is that about 30% of BIDU’s revenue in 2021 stems from IQ. Whether or not China will intervene to prevent the plunge in value of its own version of Google is unknown, but is certainly a risk that should be hedged against. I’m very confident on this trade and have verified some of the more important arguments lined in the paper, but as always do your own DD and hedge appropriately.

&#x200B;

Hi everyone, I’m here with another DD, but this time it’ll be a little different than my usual options-exclusive DD. Today, IQ has just released its 2021 Q1 result. I’ve seen a couple posts on iQIYI two years before and it seems to be the time to short squeeze it again. It has reached its historical low at servals data before, but it soon rebound for 5% after the financial statement is released. However, me and my team did a deep dive into IQ and I wanted to share this stock with you

&#x200B;

What is IQ?

iQIYI Inc is an online entertainment service provider in China and it is known as the ""Netflix of China"". It is valued at around 10 billion dollars currently. It is primarily engaged in providing a variety of services encompassing internet video, live broadcasting, online games, online literature, animations, e-commerce and social media platform. The company produces original video content and distributes appealing professionally-produced content, partner-generated content, and user-generated content. It also offers a diverse collection of internet video content that appeals to users from broad demographics. The company's revenue is generated from membership services and online advertising services. The company earns the majority of its revenue from China. The company is based in Beijing and is partly owned by Baidu, the ""Google of China"". It had its IPO in 2018 and is currently sitting at around $13.3 per share.

&#x200B;

How is IQ 2021 Q1 financial report?

Total revenues reached RMB8.0 billion (US$1.2 billion), representing a 4% increase from the same period in 2020 and beat the estimate of $1,180,000,000.

Membership services revenue was RMB4.3 billion (US$658.1 million), representing a 7% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the decline of our subscribing members from 118.9 million as of March 31, 2020, which was a high base due to the impact of Covid-19, to 105.3 million as of March 31, 2021. Our subscribing members grew 3.6 million quarter-on-quarter due to the strong content launch coupled with the holidays in the first quarter, during which people spent more time viewing content.

Online advertising services revenue was RMB1.9 billion (US$292.5 million), representing a 25% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the rebound of both brand-advertising budgets and the number of brand advertisers amid the macroeconomy recovery.

Content distribution revenue was RMB779.1 million (US$118.9 million), representing a 29% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by more content titles we distributed to other platforms during the quarter.

Other revenues were RMB961.0 million (US$146.7 million), representing a 10% increase from the same period in 2020, primarily due to the growth of certain business lines.

Cost of revenues was RMB7.1 billion (US$1.1 billion), representing a 10% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to less content costs and bandwidth cost during the quarter. Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB5.4 billion (US$829.6 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to decline of licensed content cost.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB1.2 billion (US$183.3 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. This was primarily attribute to less provision for credit losses, which was a result of improved macroeconomic environment versus the same period last year.

Research and development expenses were RMB672.3 million (US$102.6 million), representing a 1% decrease from the same period in 2020.

Operating loss was RMB1.0 billion (US$154.8 million), compared to operating loss of RMB2.2 billion in the same period in 2020. Operating loss margin was 13%, compared to operating loss margin of 29% in the same period in 2020.

Total other expense was RMB222.4 million (US$34.0 million), compared to total other expense of RMB628.5 million during the same period of 2020. The year-over-year variance was mainly due to less foreign exchange loss.

Loss before income taxes was RMB1.2 billion (US$188.7 million), compared to loss before income taxes of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020.

Income tax expense was RMB20.6 million (US$3.1 million), compared to income tax expense of RMB4.8 million in the same period in 2020.

Net loss attributable to iQIYI was RMB1.3 billion (US$193.4 million), compared to net loss attributable to iQIYI of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020. Diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS was RMB1.61 (US$0.25) for the first quarter of 2021, compared to diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS of RMB3.92 in the same period of 2020.

As of March 31, 2021, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB13.3 billion (US$2.0 billion).

&#x200B;

Financial Guidance

For the second quarter of 2021, iQIYI expects total net revenues to be between RMB7.21 billion (US$1.10 billion) and RMB7.65 billion (US$1.17 billion), representing a 3% decrease to a 3% increase year over year. This forecast reflects iQIYI's current and preliminary view, which may be subject to change.

Price Target

If we use Netflix valuation as a benchmark. We can estimate the fair market value of IQ being at least equivalent to NFLX at 216B ($480/share). However, I personally think IQ should garner less since it main business is in China while Netflix is in America, Canada, Europe, you name it. Also, the subscription member of Netflix is about 207 million while IQ has only half of it, which is 105 million. Also, the member revenues of Netflix is about 24.7 billion, while that of IQ is only 4.3 billion. IQ has only about 18% of revenues of Netflix and so give IQ an $86/share target price. But my price target for the entire company is at least $200/share as it has half of the membership service of Netflix and it is still growing for IQ. Also, there is a large room of growth for IQ as it mainly focus on mainland nowadays but it will sure expand its business overseas",nfbmkd,[],0
431,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"This pure focus on wholesale means UWMC does not spend as much cost on the servicing and advertising necessary to sustain a large retail business like for RKT. Overall, UWMC actually has had consistently higher net income margin than RKT, currently sitting at 68% vs. 58% for RKT.

UWMC's focus on wholesaling and working entirely with brokers makes it much easier for it to pivot to home purchase originations, which Freddie Mac actually predicts will grow 16% by 2022. Home purchases are more complex than refinances and the value of using a broker shines in those cases. In fact, UWMC is already more heavy on home purchases than its competitors. In the most recent quarter, 25% of its volume came from home purchases. Furthermore, a rise in interest rates may actually benefit UWMC in that the value of the loans they generate will be higher due to the higher cash flows.",nfbwv5,[],0

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a **fantastic setup**.

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

Edit: Only thing I forgot to mention was the upper trendline of the wedge extends back to that 17.25 high - this is just another data point that adds to the validity of the breakout.",nfg8mj,"['GME', 'AMC']",1
435,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"[Here](https://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/isa-furthers-its-partnership-with-beyond-meat-with-the-certification-of-the-new-iteration-of-the-beyond-burger) is one of the many articles stating that as of today BYND burgers are now HALAL certified.   


If you don't know what Halal is or why this is relevant then you are probably not Muslim or Hindu. The certification will now give BYND a huge customer base boost in my opinion. Impossible Burgers did this in 2018 so the alternative meat market in the UAE has already been introduced. I think BYND is set to capitalize on this new certification especially as meat markets are already negatively impacted from COVID issues.   


$BYND also is sitting >20% short float so any upward movement in this stock could potentially start a quick move up. The stock is sitting near $100 and to me looks to be at a nice floor psychologically ($100 is a nice round bottom for people to buy near).   


Finally the OATLY IPO is coming quick. The alternative meat / protein space will likely be the talk of the town at near the end of the week which may bring BYND up or down with it as the IPO happens. The good ole sympathy trade...   


Disclosure: No I'm not muslim / hindu but I do have family that is. This certification gives them ""confidence"" that during the holidays they can still eat this food. It also allows them to serve this food at events, which is something I know has been an issue in the past for us personally. If it's not Halal it won't be served at a party / event.",nfh8o2,[],1

448,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"I'm copying the abstract of the paper (Bradley et al. 2021 WP) -- don't blame me on that.

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit’s Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‘buy’ recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

* If 410 fails look for 407.70 - 406.65 - 405 - 404.02

Instead, weather risks, drought risks, execution risks, and other supply chain bottlenecks have impacts on the prices in the short and mid term and sometimes the long term. 
BEFORE you make any investment decision in Corn, let’s run through these important things:
1. WHO grows corn?
The 2 leading producers of corn include the US at 1 and China at 2 that is over 50% of total production. 
2. WHO consumes Corn?
Well… it’s The US and China accounting for over 50% of total consumption

The US is the top exporter
4.WHO is top importer?

5. Risks?
As with every investment there is always downside risk! The downside risk here could be from many different factors, however, these are less likely and at current corn prices already priced in. 
These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil. 
-The absence of supply chain disruptions which, let’s face it, is not the theme so far in 2021.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

Joe Atk

16 hours agoWhen Stankey (ATT CEO) asked for a salary increase, the shareholders rightly said ""NO"", as he hadn't proven himself yet. What's becoming clear is that he threw a tantrum and unwound a deal by his predecessor for an eye watering loss, then informed the shareholders they would be on the hook for the poor decision financially by shouldering a dividend cut. Investors still don't know the details of the deal, nor were they able to vote on it (getting their hand smacked again for voting against a salary increase for Stankey). The whole thing seems shady, slimy, and smacks of robbing shareholders to pay for poor management decisions that cost billions. But, hey...Stankey sure got the shareholders back for not allowing a few lousy extra million on his pay stub.  Not to mention that Stankey was the former CEO of WarnerMedia. He's completely spun off his wheelhouse, his main area of expertise, to take T back to being a phone company. Stankey has yet to prove he knows anything about telecom.  A potential investor looking at AT&T should think long and hard before entrusting their resources to current leadership at T. Not only would it be a bad idea to place hard earned funds at the mercy of an imperious, vindictive man-child CEO, but the quality of the bad deals made just in the past five years is staggering and directly reflected in the current share price.

Today I would like to introduce you to a recently discovered game company. 

The current share price encourages you to take investment risk in the face of huge profits in the future. 

Currently, the company has planned for June the premiere of its refined game Drift21, which was previously available on Steam in the early access phase to gather feedback from players. Driving physics, textures and gameplay quality have been refined in collaboration with professional esports players and drfit drivers. What's more, the project has potential in multi mode and esports. The company has repeatedly postponed the premiere of the game because the CEO believes that he wants a 100% refined product - rush is not indicated, as the case of Cyberpunk 2077 showed. He even changed the publisher of the game who pushed too much for an earlier release. Which may suggest launching a really refined product. 

Moreover, the company plans to complete work on the next edition of Car Mechanic Simulator and the new Gearshift game. 

As far as the financial aspect is concerned, the company lives off the profits it currently generates, and allocates the surplus to development. Does not have excessive indebtedness. 

Summing up, the company has been listed on the stock exchange for a relatively short time and its fundamental assumptions give it prospects for development and excellent profits for investors.

1. For those aiming to purely make a quick and speculative play, skip to the ""Upcoming Catalysts and Timeline"" and ""TLDR"" section below.
2. \*Caveat. This is not financial advice nor am I liable for any of your investment decisions. I can literally bicep curl better than I write DD posts yet alone invest so please do so in your own terms.

# A. Preamble

Oncology+eternal is one of the most underslept stocks in the biotech yet alone larger investing community, no question. I've tried to search for any due diligence posts and was surprised to see that there are literally 0 hits in the WSB forum (barring one random ass post about hedge fund activity from a year back) . Considering its solid clinical results and upcoming catalysts (literally in a few weeks), I don't see why it isn't getting the recognition it deserves.

This is an early stage biotech specializing in targeting ROR1 expressing cancers. While cancer has always been a hot topic in this industry, this is one of the *few* companies addressing it through the lens of ROR1. I'll explain more about ROR1 below but this isn't your run of the mill gene, protein, or whatever that other pharma companies are focusing on. VelosBio, another company focused on ROR1 cancers was acquired by Merck in 2020 for $2.8B ([https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/merck-inks-2-8b-velosbio-buyout-to-snag-anti-ror1-adc](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/merck-inks-2-8b-velosbio-buyout-to-snag-anti-ror1-adc)). The same for NBE-Therapeutics for $1.5B in 2020 by Boehringer Ingelheim ([https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/boehringer-inks-1-5b-nbe-buyout-joining-merck-ror1-adc-race](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/boehringer-inks-1-5b-nbe-buyout-joining-merck-ror1-adc-race)) . Looks like huge players in pharma are interested in ROR1 for some reason, and lucky for us, oncology eternal does *exactly* that.

# B. Cirmtuzumab for MCL and CLL (Blood Cancer)

https://preview.redd.it/0x1wfrdig2071.png?width=510&format=png&auto=webp&s=c47feb12361fb82d7663958d59a032c4260a5f1c

A lot of things destroy cancer but those same things can also destroy our own healthy cells. **Cirmutzumab** is a potential first in class monoclonal antibody developed by this firm and targets the ROR1 protein on the surface of cancer cells. ROR1 activity is associated with very **aggressive** symptoms ranging from metastasis to treatment resistance. Lucky for us, ROR1 is *highly* specific to a wide range of different cancers as seen in the figure below and is the very thing cirmtuzumab targets.

**Figure 1**. ROR1 Expression Across Different Tumors

https://preview.redd.it/ywgmggdqg2071.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=287ee97bac7fd4efabdebe9ce4140dab43184cd4

As seen in Figure 1, indications of interest are Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), both of which express ROR1 at extremely high levels. These are B-cell malignancies or hematologic cancers. Alright enough with the fluffy intros, **what does the data say?**

**Figure 2.** CIRLL Phase ½ Trial Data for MCL and CLL

https://preview.redd.it/kih0erxvg2071.png?width=1760&format=png&auto=webp&s=facc16dd176d70952b0bf17f1459a8320812f65a

In a treatment design combining cirmtuzumab with ibrutinib, another treatment for hematologic malignancies, the **objective response rate** for MCL was **87%** and **92%** for CLL (Figure 2). So why was cirmtu incorporated with ibrutinib to begin with? Unfortunately, a large number of older patients develop resistance to ibrutinib and hematological disease like MCL can be extremely aggressive with a low 5-year survival rate ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7281539/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7281539/)). The combination not only exceeded the efficacy of standalone ibrutinib therapy for MCL with a historical ORR of around 65% but also did so in high-risk populations that were **heavily pre-treated with other therapies**. The data is non-negotiable (Figure 3).

**Figure 3**. Overview of Results in Sub-Populations. CR stands for complete response while PR stands for partial response.

https://preview.redd.it/c8jgg78yg2071.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f66c662d6bbc2fa9abf67247dc14eb2c0e16d51a

Like I said before, a lot of things can attack cancer albeit at the expense of our own cells. Safety is all the more important for cancer and older patients with potentially compromised immune function. There were **0 discontinuations or dose limiting toxicities from cirmtuzumab**. So we potentially have a promising new therapy that targets a range of cancers effectively while minimizing treatment side-effects. Sounds like a solid win to me.

As a side note, the company recently expanded their indications to other cancers such as breast cancer. In a trial conducted in UC San Diego, patients with HER2 negative metastatic or locally advanced unresectable breast cancer were treated with cirmtuzumab + paclitaxel. This is an **extremely aggressive form of breast cancer** with patients receiving a **median of 6 prior therapies**. The study reported an objective response rate of around 57% which beats the historical rate at around 30% for this subgroup of patients.

The company is also in dialogue with the **FDA for a potential accelerated approval study for MCL.** Now, clinical trials can last years so will we have patent protection once this therapy is approved? Yup, **patent protection extending all the way to 2033**.

# C. TK216 for Ewing Sarcoma

https://preview.redd.it/ifl4z2rhh2071.png?width=766&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb58f2b986365d623ec63fa8a2ede9694b8a2186

To pivot, the company is also developing a treatment called **TK216** for Ewing Sarcoma. Ewing sarcoma is a very rare pediatric cancer and the 2nd most common pediatric bone cancer. The current standard of care is absolutely abysmal and is based on chemotherapy and invasive surgical procedures. I seriously can't stress how pitiful current treatments are for this disease.

TK216 targets a family of proteins called ETS factors that are directly implicated in Ewing sarcoma and other cancers. So what does the data say about TK216? Well, in a phase ½ trial conducted on patients with relapsed Ewing sarcoma and who received on average **4 prior therapies**, TK216 accomplished a **9% complete response rate** and **43% disease control rate**. Looks crappy right? Until you dig around and look at the response rates of approved therapies for this disease, you won't realize how **phenomenal** these results are. The FDA seems to agree and has assigned TK216 with an **orphan drug designation for Ewing Sarcoma**.

**Figure 4**. TK216 Clinical Response Rate in Relapsed or Refractory Ewing Sarcoma

https://preview.redd.it/ea24k3f2h2071.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=85df58eee845746e79f1ed34e8b6b3841c0a3ba8

# D. *** Upcoming Catalysts and Timeline

Here's a brief overview on the expected milestones and timeline

https://preview.redd.it/n9ntoff3h2071.png?width=1886&format=png&auto=webp&s=e50e8a66fb63eea6c2eea498368101a7047695f7

**Most importantly** **and the reason why I'm writing this post right now**, oncology eternal will be presenting its most updated results for cirmtuzumab on MCL and CLL patients and TK216 on Ewing sarcoma in the **2021 ASCO Conference on June 4th and 7th**. This is **highly anticipated data** in what is the world's leading cancer conference, and I expect a huge run up to the conference. Just for reference, it experienced a 78.1% surge in price after releasing an update on its phase ½ trial for cirmtuzumab back in November of 2020. Moreover, the embargoed abstracts for these results will be released **today on May 19th** **at 5PM EST.**

I wanted to spend more time writing a thorough DD highlighting additional factors such as the management team, details on market potential, expansion into CAR-T therapy, etc. but I wanted to at least post something up before the expected run up to the ASCO conference. If you are interested, I will be happy to write a part II and follow up to this post.

# TLDR

1. Promising data on hematological cancers and Ewing sarcoma to be released in **June 4th and 7th,** making this a possible short-term play. Historically, large surges in price with each data release.
2. Embargoed abstracts for #1 to be released **today May 19th.**

Is UWMC that much better that I should ditch RKT? If so please explain.

I know RKT guidance is down but 


- the P/E ratio of under 7 is extremely cheap

- They have a great current ratio

- They are profitable which is great during inflation times like now. Revenue and earnings are steady in guidance for the next two years 

- Possible addition to S&P 500

- Dominant name in the industry


This is a conversation around fundamentals. If UWMC is a pure short squeeze I understand but I think RKT is so much better than it’s valued or forecasted to perform relative to other stocks in the broader market.

972,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"As many are aware, the 13F for Michael Burry’s hedge fund was released on Monday. His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that’s why I’m not Dr. Burry. I’m sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I’m posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I’m missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn’t detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I’m thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT. The fed claims this inflation is transitory, but I don’t think anyone on the street buys it. I think rates have to come up at least a little bit sometime between now and next January.

If there’s anything else I should be considering for this trade please comment, I’m interested in hearing other opinions on this.

1.**The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets—i.e., much more dollar printing.**

**Let me dig in !**

The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion.

NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over “confidence” index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *“actually”* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *“demand”* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ew6w5tu19vz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bba4677ec15d513e78d6d19644722b133068a48

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***“pulled forward”***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***“costs”*** **of** ***“long-term employment”*** **for a** ***“short-term”*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.** Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bcfon349vz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b498f76db582407f08e593e10dc5692e6005f2

 

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w1cuikh69vz61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b01f66a5badd3fc80e79abecd97096e309324a5

 

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it’ll be worse than expected:**

We finally got “official” confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It’s not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don’t hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time—i.e., the CPI is likely going even higher. 

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a “return to work bonus” in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one’s wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact. Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. For Silver q2 /2021 my targets are 42 Usd /ozz while gold 1.900 Usd/ozz .

GOOD JOB! TAX THE SHORTS! 

The 7.50c line held strong and the stock kept the Friday gains and pushed a bit more.

UWMC is obviously picking up some steam here on Reddit with spillover into many other stock-related platforms (yahoo, twits, alpha, etc). That chatter will certainly help continue the push.

Up some change in Pre-market for what it's worth but should only get better throughout the day.

This is a powder keg ready to go as soon as the 9c's go in the money. If we can exercise at 7.50 and 9 (EXERCISE FRIDAY 5/21 IF YOU CAN FRONT THE Cash!!!).

I suggest exercising even if you are 0.01$ ITM.

The Volume 05/17 was impressive at 17M (8M average) so there is certainly upwards pressure due to buying volume.

Another 2 days like yesterday and those 9c start printing, then it is really off the races and not messing with 8,10% and instead watching a serious gap UP.

Hopes some powder was saved for the push to 9c . I will be buying a few more shares today once some other options are sold for liquidity.

Position:I am loaded up on 6/18 8c and LEAPS. I still really like UWMC long-term but this short-term profit potential is simply staggering.

UWMC looks really good for breaking 9 by Thursday, we already have the 7.50c's ready to print from the push last week, then it's TO THE MOON as those options are exercised. 9c needs to hit this week to hit 12-14 (minimum) next week.

LETS GET FUCKING PAID!

983,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"Disclaimer and Risks: This is not a financial advice. Be cautious to bet against Winnie the Pooh🐻. One major risk factor is the fact that BIDU owns 53.08% of IQ, and even more worrisome is that about 30% of BIDU’s revenue in 2021 stems from IQ. Whether or not China will intervene to prevent the plunge in value of its own version of Google is unknown, but is certainly a risk that should be hedged against. I’m very confident on this trade and have verified some of the more important arguments lined in the paper, but as always do your own DD and hedge appropriately.

&#x200B;

Hi everyone, I’m here with another DD, but this time it’ll be a little different than my usual options-exclusive DD. Today, IQ has just released its 2021 Q1 result. I’ve seen a couple posts on iQIYI two years before and it seems to be the time to short squeeze it again. It has reached its historical low at servals data before, but it soon rebound for 5% after the financial statement is released. However, me and my team did a deep dive into IQ and I wanted to share this stock with you

&#x200B;

What is IQ?

iQIYI Inc is an online entertainment service provider in China and it is known as the ""Netflix of China"". It is valued at around 10 billion dollars currently. It is primarily engaged in providing a variety of services encompassing internet video, live broadcasting, online games, online literature, animations, e-commerce and social media platform. The company produces original video content and distributes appealing professionally-produced content, partner-generated content, and user-generated content. It also offers a diverse collection of internet video content that appeals to users from broad demographics. The company's revenue is generated from membership services and online advertising services. The company earns the majority of its revenue from China. The company is based in Beijing and is partly owned by Baidu, the ""Google of China"". It had its IPO in 2018 and is currently sitting at around $13.3 per share.

&#x200B;

How is IQ 2021 Q1 financial report?

Total revenues reached RMB8.0 billion (US$1.2 billion), representing a 4% increase from the same period in 2020 and beat the estimate of $1,180,000,000.

Membership services revenue was RMB4.3 billion (US$658.1 million), representing a 7% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the decline of our subscribing members from 118.9 million as of March 31, 2020, which was a high base due to the impact of Covid-19, to 105.3 million as of March 31, 2021. Our subscribing members grew 3.6 million quarter-on-quarter due to the strong content launch coupled with the holidays in the first quarter, during which people spent more time viewing content.

Online advertising services revenue was RMB1.9 billion (US$292.5 million), representing a 25% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the rebound of both brand-advertising budgets and the number of brand advertisers amid the macroeconomy recovery.

Content distribution revenue was RMB779.1 million (US$118.9 million), representing a 29% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by more content titles we distributed to other platforms during the quarter.

Other revenues were RMB961.0 million (US$146.7 million), representing a 10% increase from the same period in 2020, primarily due to the growth of certain business lines.

Cost of revenues was RMB7.1 billion (US$1.1 billion), representing a 10% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to less content costs and bandwidth cost during the quarter. Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB5.4 billion (US$829.6 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to decline of licensed content cost.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB1.2 billion (US$183.3 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. This was primarily attribute to less provision for credit losses, which was a result of improved macroeconomic environment versus the same period last year.

Research and development expenses were RMB672.3 million (US$102.6 million), representing a 1% decrease from the same period in 2020.

Operating loss was RMB1.0 billion (US$154.8 million), compared to operating loss of RMB2.2 billion in the same period in 2020. Operating loss margin was 13%, compared to operating loss margin of 29% in the same period in 2020.

Total other expense was RMB222.4 million (US$34.0 million), compared to total other expense of RMB628.5 million during the same period of 2020. The year-over-year variance was mainly due to less foreign exchange loss.

Loss before income taxes was RMB1.2 billion (US$188.7 million), compared to loss before income taxes of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020.

Income tax expense was RMB20.6 million (US$3.1 million), compared to income tax expense of RMB4.8 million in the same period in 2020.

Net loss attributable to iQIYI was RMB1.3 billion (US$193.4 million), compared to net loss attributable to iQIYI of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020. Diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS was RMB1.61 (US$0.25) for the first quarter of 2021, compared to diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS of RMB3.92 in the same period of 2020.

As of March 31, 2021, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB13.3 billion (US$2.0 billion).

&#x200B;

Financial Guidance

For the second quarter of 2021, iQIYI expects total net revenues to be between RMB7.21 billion (US$1.10 billion) and RMB7.65 billion (US$1.17 billion), representing a 3% decrease to a 3% increase year over year. This forecast reflects iQIYI's current and preliminary view, which may be subject to change.

Price Target

If we use Netflix valuation as a benchmark. We can estimate the fair market value of IQ being at least equivalent to NFLX at 216B ($480/share). However, I personally think IQ should garner less since it main business is in China while Netflix is in America, Canada, Europe, you name it. Also, the subscription member of Netflix is about 207 million while IQ has only half of it, which is 105 million. Also, the member revenues of Netflix is about 24.7 billion, while that of IQ is only 4.3 billion. IQ has only about 18% of revenues of Netflix and so give IQ an $86/share target price. But my price target for the entire company is at least $200/share as it has half of the membership service of Netflix and it is still growing for IQ. Also, there is a large room of growth for IQ as it mainly focus on mainland nowadays but it will sure expand its business overseas",nfbmkd,[],0
984,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"This pure focus on wholesale means UWMC does not spend as much cost on the servicing and advertising necessary to sustain a large retail business like for RKT. Overall, UWMC actually has had consistently higher net income margin than RKT, currently sitting at 68% vs. 58% for RKT.

UWMC's focus on wholesaling and working entirely with brokers makes it much easier for it to pivot to home purchase originations, which Freddie Mac actually predicts will grow 16% by 2022. Home purchases are more complex than refinances and the value of using a broker shines in those cases. In fact, UWMC is already more heavy on home purchases than its competitors. In the most recent quarter, 25% of its volume came from home purchases. Furthermore, a rise in interest rates may actually benefit UWMC in that the value of the loans they generate will be higher due to the higher cash flows.",nfbwv5,[],0
987,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"A lot of people from my $GME post were curious about the technicals on $AMC - so I figured I would post them as well.

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a **fantastic setup**.

[AMC TA](https://preview.redd.it/gju8synduwz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=46c863adbb144c04e3327bb212a79bb1633608fc)

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

Not Financial Advice

Edit: Only thing I forgot to mention was the upper trendline of the wedge extends back to that 17.25 high - this is just another data point that adds to the validity of the breakout.",nfg8mj,"['GME', 'AMC']",1
988,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"[Here](https://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/isa-furthers-its-partnership-with-beyond-meat-with-the-certification-of-the-new-iteration-of-the-beyond-burger) is one of the many articles stating that as of today BYND burgers are now HALAL certified.   


If you don't know what Halal is or why this is relevant then you are probably not Muslim or Hindu. The certification will now give BYND a huge customer base boost in my opinion. Impossible Burgers did this in 2018 so the alternative meat market in the UAE has already been introduced. I think BYND is set to capitalize on this new certification especially as meat markets are already negatively impacted from COVID issues.   


$BYND also is sitting >20% short float so any upward movement in this stock could potentially start a quick move up. The stock is sitting near $100 and to me looks to be at a nice floor psychologically ($100 is a nice round bottom for people to buy near).   


Finally the OATLY IPO is coming quick. The alternative meat / protein space will likely be the talk of the town at near the end of the week which may bring BYND up or down with it as the IPO happens. The good ole sympathy trade...   


Disclosure: No I'm not muslim / hindu but I do have family that is. This certification gives them ""confidence"" that during the holidays they can still eat this food. It also allows them to serve this food at events, which is something I know has been an issue in the past for us personally. If it's not Halal it won't be served at a party / event.",nfh8o2,[],1

1001,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"I'm copying the abstract of the paper (Bradley et al. 2021 WP) -- don't blame me on that.

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit’s Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‘buy’ recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

* If bears continue putting the pressure and we close 410-405 tomorrow the w seems to be forming and nearer to completion. To complete, we need a bounce around 405-410 bottom and to cross 417.86 range. I believe if we cross 417.86 we will see all time highs in the near future. Bulls have a lot of work to do though.

Corn the US crop that has had its highs and lows over a long history but continues to have massive demand worldwide for a variety of uses and it is not slowing. Instead, weather risks, drought risks, execution risks, and other supply chain bottlenecks have impacts on the prices in the short and mid term and sometimes the long term. 
BEFORE you make any investment decision in Corn, let’s run through these important things:
1. WHO grows corn?
The 2 leading producers of corn include the US at 1 and China at 2 that is over 50% of total production. 
2. WHO consumes Corn?
Well… it’s The US and China accounting for over 50% of total consumption

The US is the top exporter
4.WHO is top importer?

5. Risks?
As with every investment there is always downside risk! The downside risk here could be from many different factors, however, these are less likely and at current corn prices already priced in. 
These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil. 
-The absence of supply chain disruptions which, let’s face it, is not the theme so far in 2021.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

Joe Atk

16 hours agoWhen Stankey (ATT CEO) asked for a salary increase, the shareholders rightly said ""NO"", as he hadn't proven himself yet. What's becoming clear is that he threw a tantrum and unwound a deal by his predecessor for an eye watering loss, then informed the shareholders they would be on the hook for the poor decision financially by shouldering a dividend cut. Investors still don't know the details of the deal, nor were they able to vote on it (getting their hand smacked again for voting against a salary increase for Stankey). The whole thing seems shady, slimy, and smacks of robbing shareholders to pay for poor management decisions that cost billions. But, hey...Stankey sure got the shareholders back for not allowing a few lousy extra million on his pay stub.  Not to mention that Stankey was the former CEO of WarnerMedia. He's completely spun off his wheelhouse, his main area of expertise, to take T back to being a phone company. Stankey has yet to prove he knows anything about telecom.  A potential investor looking at AT&T should think long and hard before entrusting their resources to current leadership at T. Not only would it be a bad idea to place hard earned funds at the mercy of an imperious, vindictive man-child CEO, but the quality of the bad deals made just in the past five years is staggering and directly reflected in the current share price.

Today I would like to introduce you to a recently discovered game company. 

The current share price encourages you to take investment risk in the face of huge profits in the future. 

Currently, the company has planned for June the premiere of its refined game Drift21, which was previously available on Steam in the early access phase to gather feedback from players. Driving physics, textures and gameplay quality have been refined in collaboration with professional esports players and drfit drivers. What's more, the project has potential in multi mode and esports. The company has repeatedly postponed the premiere of the game because the CEO believes that he wants a 100% refined product - rush is not indicated, as the case of Cyberpunk 2077 showed. He even changed the publisher of the game who pushed too much for an earlier release. Which may suggest launching a really refined product. 

Moreover, the company plans to complete work on the next edition of Car Mechanic Simulator and the new Gearshift game. 

As far as the financial aspect is concerned, the company lives off the profits it currently generates, and allocates the surplus to development. Does not have excessive indebtedness. 

Summing up, the company has been listed on the stock exchange for a relatively short time and its fundamental assumptions give it prospects for development and excellent profits for investors.

1. For those aiming to purely make a quick and speculative play, skip to the ""Upcoming Catalysts and Timeline"" and ""TLDR"" section below.
2. \*Caveat. This is not financial advice nor am I liable for any of your investment decisions. I can literally bicep curl better than I write DD posts yet alone invest so please do so in your own terms.

# A. Preamble

Oncology+eternal is one of the most underslept stocks in the biotech yet alone larger investing community, no question. I've tried to search for any due diligence posts and was surprised to see that there are literally 0 hits in the WSB forum (barring one random ass post about hedge fund activity from a year back) . Considering its solid clinical results and upcoming catalysts (literally in a few weeks), I don't see why it isn't getting the recognition it deserves.

This is an early stage biotech specializing in targeting ROR1 expressing cancers. While cancer has always been a hot topic in this industry, this is one of the *few* companies addressing it through the lens of ROR1. I'll explain more about ROR1 below but this isn't your run of the mill gene, protein, or whatever that other pharma companies are focusing on. VelosBio, another company focused on ROR1 cancers was acquired by Merck in 2020 for $2.8B ([https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/merck-inks-2-8b-velosbio-buyout-to-snag-anti-ror1-adc](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/merck-inks-2-8b-velosbio-buyout-to-snag-anti-ror1-adc)). The same for NBE-Therapeutics for $1.5B in 2020 by Boehringer Ingelheim ([https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/boehringer-inks-1-5b-nbe-buyout-joining-merck-ror1-adc-race](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/boehringer-inks-1-5b-nbe-buyout-joining-merck-ror1-adc-race)) . Looks like huge players in pharma are interested in ROR1 for some reason, and lucky for us, oncology eternal does *exactly* that.

# B. Cirmtuzumab for MCL and CLL (Blood Cancer)

https://preview.redd.it/0x1wfrdig2071.png?width=510&format=png&auto=webp&s=c47feb12361fb82d7663958d59a032c4260a5f1c

A lot of things destroy cancer but those same things can also destroy our own healthy cells. **Cirmutzumab** is a potential first in class monoclonal antibody developed by this firm and targets the ROR1 protein on the surface of cancer cells. ROR1 activity is associated with very **aggressive** symptoms ranging from metastasis to treatment resistance. Lucky for us, ROR1 is *highly* specific to a wide range of different cancers as seen in the figure below and is the very thing cirmtuzumab targets.

**Figure 1**. ROR1 Expression Across Different Tumors

https://preview.redd.it/ywgmggdqg2071.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=287ee97bac7fd4efabdebe9ce4140dab43184cd4

As seen in Figure 1, indications of interest are Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), both of which express ROR1 at extremely high levels. These are B-cell malignancies or hematologic cancers. Alright enough with the fluffy intros, **what does the data say?**

**Figure 2.** CIRLL Phase ½ Trial Data for MCL and CLL

https://preview.redd.it/kih0erxvg2071.png?width=1760&format=png&auto=webp&s=facc16dd176d70952b0bf17f1459a8320812f65a

In a treatment design combining cirmtuzumab with ibrutinib, another treatment for hematologic malignancies, the **objective response rate** for MCL was **87%** and **92%** for CLL (Figure 2). So why was cirmtu incorporated with ibrutinib to begin with? Unfortunately, a large number of older patients develop resistance to ibrutinib and hematological disease like MCL can be extremely aggressive with a low 5-year survival rate ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7281539/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7281539/)). The combination not only exceeded the efficacy of standalone ibrutinib therapy for MCL with a historical ORR of around 65% but also did so in high-risk populations that were **heavily pre-treated with other therapies**. The data is non-negotiable (Figure 3).

**Figure 3**. Overview of Results in Sub-Populations. CR stands for complete response while PR stands for partial response.

https://preview.redd.it/c8jgg78yg2071.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f66c662d6bbc2fa9abf67247dc14eb2c0e16d51a

Like I said before, a lot of things can attack cancer albeit at the expense of our own cells. Safety is all the more important for cancer and older patients with potentially compromised immune function. There were **0 discontinuations or dose limiting toxicities from cirmtuzumab**. So we potentially have a promising new therapy that targets a range of cancers effectively while minimizing treatment side-effects. Sounds like a solid win to me.

As a side note, the company recently expanded their indications to other cancers such as breast cancer. In a trial conducted in UC San Diego, patients with HER2 negative metastatic or locally advanced unresectable breast cancer were treated with cirmtuzumab + paclitaxel. This is an **extremely aggressive form of breast cancer** with patients receiving a **median of 6 prior therapies**. The study reported an objective response rate of around 57% which beats the historical rate at around 30% for this subgroup of patients.

The company is also in dialogue with the **FDA for a potential accelerated approval study for MCL.** Now, clinical trials can last years so will we have patent protection once this therapy is approved? Yup, **patent protection extending all the way to 2033**.

# C. TK216 for Ewing Sarcoma

https://preview.redd.it/ifl4z2rhh2071.png?width=766&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb58f2b986365d623ec63fa8a2ede9694b8a2186

To pivot, the company is also developing a treatment called **TK216** for Ewing Sarcoma. Ewing sarcoma is a very rare pediatric cancer and the 2nd most common pediatric bone cancer. The current standard of care is absolutely abysmal and is based on chemotherapy and invasive surgical procedures. I seriously can't stress how pitiful current treatments are for this disease.

TK216 targets a family of proteins called ETS factors that are directly implicated in Ewing sarcoma and other cancers. So what does the data say about TK216? Well, in a phase ½ trial conducted on patients with relapsed Ewing sarcoma and who received on average **4 prior therapies**, TK216 accomplished a **9% complete response rate** and **43% disease control rate**. Looks crappy right? Until you dig around and look at the response rates of approved therapies for this disease, you won't realize how **phenomenal** these results are. The FDA seems to agree and has assigned TK216 with an **orphan drug designation for Ewing Sarcoma**.

**Figure 4**. TK216 Clinical Response Rate in Relapsed or Refractory Ewing Sarcoma

https://preview.redd.it/ea24k3f2h2071.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=85df58eee845746e79f1ed34e8b6b3841c0a3ba8

# D. *** Upcoming Catalysts and Timeline

Here's a brief overview on the expected milestones and timeline

https://preview.redd.it/n9ntoff3h2071.png?width=1886&format=png&auto=webp&s=e50e8a66fb63eea6c2eea498368101a7047695f7

**Most importantly** **and the reason why I'm writing this post right now**, oncology eternal will be presenting its most updated results for cirmtuzumab on MCL and CLL patients and TK216 on Ewing sarcoma in the **2021 ASCO Conference on June 4th and 7th**. This is **highly anticipated data** in what is the world's leading cancer conference, and I expect a huge run up to the conference. Just for reference, it experienced a 78.1% surge in price after releasing an update on its phase ½ trial for cirmtuzumab back in November of 2020. Moreover, the embargoed abstracts for these results will be released **today on May 19th** **at 5PM EST.**

I wanted to spend more time writing a thorough DD highlighting additional factors such as the management team, details on market potential, expansion into CAR-T therapy, etc. but I wanted to at least post something up before the expected run up to the ASCO conference. If you are interested, I will be happy to write a part II and follow up to this post.

# TLDR

1. Promising data on hematological cancers and Ewing sarcoma to be released in **June 4th and 7th,** making this a possible short-term play. Historically, large surges in price with each data release.
2. Embargoed abstracts for #1 to be released **today May 19th.**
3. Highly undervalued firm with ridiculous upside.",ng3x1p,[],1

**TL:DR: My Thesis**

I think Netflix was secretly trying to drive these companies into the ground and hold their heads underwater with their hedgy henchmen. Their plan was within sight with the Lockdowns as both companies were hit hard. They were very close and slotted for BlockBusters fate until **we stepped in and fucked it up**. With everyone straped into their couches this last year binging tiger king how do you increase revenue? They've been trading sidways ever since. Now Netflix is fucked. The release of Cuties shot themselves in the foot (lost 800,000) viewers at such a competitive time in the streaming sector.

Karma's a bitch, just like my stepmom: Netflix has it coming, and that's why I'm not very tall and I hear they have hedges in between the Eiffel tower. *yeah you like that?*

2328,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"As an avid investor, I often speak with financial advisors about where I should be putting my money. Of course, with any new administration comes a new stock set to explode and others set to fall. The financial advisors whom I have spoken with have advised me to stay away from oil and coal and to start putting more and more money into renewable energy ETFs and companies. The two stocks that they projected would gain the most are listed below. 
- FuelCell Energy (FCEL) 
- iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) 
These two are predicted to skyrocket under the Biden administration due to his push for renewable energy, especially if the Green New Deal is passed. Though they seem like big bets, I am confident in my advisors and I know that this community has never been afraid of big bets and will trust in my advisors as well.",nexk1o,[],0
2330,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"I don't normally play meme stocks - but I thought the GME technical setup was especially intriguing recently.

[GME TA](https://preview.redd.it/1tmj448o6sz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=1de6593bb253ff2a102250d3e4a97d521e0b3455)

The setup is a symmetrical triangle. Normally when continuation patterns come from downside - they have a bearish bias. However - we broke that red trendline  with an uptick in volume - this was a hint we were ready for an actual reversal. That trendline kept us in a downtrend for about 4 months. Not only that but...

**TODAY WE BROKE THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE UP - WHICH MEANS ITS FULL SPEED AHEAD!**

Confluence between technicals generate the best signals.

This is the best the setup has looked since GME was at 10. Price target for this is 231.52 resistance initially, followed by 348.50. Breakout is invalid and play is dead if we get a daily close back under 158.11.

And... that's it.

I've been trading for a long time and only use patterns, trendlines & volume. Keep it simple. You don't need to waste 100 hours doing 15 paragraphs of DD for one swing trade - or look at 100 different indicators cherry picking the ones that say your position will go up.

***TL;DR*** \- GME actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

***EDIT:*** Clarification - I wasn't speaking for GME as a whole when I said it was dead under 158.11 - I simply meant this setup in particular was no longer valid. It could always form a new one. I chose that level because it's the most significant one below the breakout point.

Edit 2: Not Financial Advice (i thought that was a given)

Edit 3: It's back testing so far - really common in Technical Analysis. Price will retrace the pattern it broke from before deciding direction. Focused on the daily close to determine whether it's a fake breakout (when a stock closes back inside a pattern the candle after breaking out) - which happens.

Edit 4: Backtested - and bouncing so far.

Really important to reclaim 174.26 on the hourly close. You can see we bounced off this zone from 168.07 - 167.55 - that's key demand or support.
 
https://ibb.co/XS1t1dL

Edit 5: Reclaimed 174.26 - back tested that as well. Key levels are normally retraced as we move. Price wants to confirm that resistance has become a support.
Now, 174.26 must hold as support - and we are looking pretty good.

https://ibb.co/fCrq0Fb

Edit 6: Bull flagging now into lunch time, New support put up at 176.48. Constructive.

https://ibb.co/3WTR25r

Edit 7: Great breakout from that flag. New support put up at 181.50. Still need the 1:45 close for confirmation. Look at the volume on that candle - shorts trying to defend this breakout with their lives.

https://ibb.co/cFHv6W6

Edit 8: Keyboard warriors storming my DMs at open - quit trading, you are more driven by your emotions than a teenage girl.

Self proclaimed geniuses saying ""TA Doesn't Work On GME, Ban"" - it's not that TA doesn't work on GME: 
The issue is - all the TA you guys normally upvote is done by some kid who watched three YouTube videos on it the night before. I don't blame you for feeling that way though - so many of these people the past few months with the influx of retail in trading. 

Just because you don't understand something and are afraid to admit it, doesn't mean you should dismiss it.

The sheer amount of hate GME posts get on this sub is a super bullish data point honestly - insane how sentiment shifted. You guys are getting played like a fiddle. The tutes have been pushing this thing both ways the whole time and using you all as a scapegoat.

Lastly I, appreciate the people who have been messaging me with legitimate questions eager to learn. DMs are open.

Edit 9: 189.00 is the next resistance coming up - careful there. Like I said, 181.50 is the new support to hold. Still on track for my price targets. Volume is in all the right spots.

Edit 10: Backtested & we are moving again. Support is actually a zone from 182.51 - 181.50. Notice how the volume on that red candle was literally nothing compared to the prior two. Remember some resistance at 189.00 - might flag there the rest of the day.

https://ibb.co/hyj7mrf

Edit 11 [3:13 P.M. 5/18/2021]: Notice how every candle we aren't making new highs has decreased volume. Still bullish consolidation below this key 189.00 resistance. Above there, straight to 200+. Shorts going to fight for their lives this last hour. I'm watching this rising channel in yellow to dictate the near-term trend.

https://ibb.co/R634KNj

Edit 12 [3:46 P.M. 5/18/2021]: They got the close just below the uptrend. Not a great sign - but only a 15m trend so not too damning. 
We need to hold 182.51 - 181.50. They are going to try and test that now. Shorts doing everything they can to dump this thing before we close to high up.
Still garbage volume on the red candles which is encouraging. Literally no volume the last hour as we trend down.

https://ibb.co/VpDJQr0

Edit 12 [4:01 P.M. 5/18/2021]: Not an awful close - but definitely not a great one. Shorts fought hard end of day - the fuckers. They know if we break 189 they are done for. Important thing though - breakout is still intact. Also - broader market dumped hard end of day which didn't help.

2333,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"Before I say anything and you ape crustfucks bend me over in the comments - I believe $AMC is about to fly. This post isn't intended to draw away from that, just an opportunity that I see and would like to share. This play is based on $AMCs undoubtable liftoff to $30+.

AMC READY TO FLY.

Plenty of DD has been done on AMC and why its going to take off - I'm not here to talk about that. It is coiled, has popped, and is ready to rip a new butthole in the sky.

&#x200B;

$CNK is AMCs largest competitor and is in the great business we know as movie theaters. When AMC last went crazy, CNK ran up over 56% in a few days from 22-27 of January to $27+. In the past month, AMC is up over 50%. CNK is roughly even. It is lagging behind and is due for a major pop on this AMC craze. It is a classically more boring stock that takes a big nudge to move.

Breaking out similar to AMC. Insanely strong volume shelf in low 20s (high demand) and above 1D 21MA. RSI has lots of room to run. 

**MARGIN**

CNK has a much lower implied volatility and actually allows for margin borrowing. This could be attractive depending on your risk appetite

**DILUTION/FINANCIALS**

CNK has almost no share dilution since the pandemic started, and it has been historically stronger than AMC from a traditional (retarded) financial perspective. AMCs market value growth has passed CNKs by many multiples over the past year. No reason she can't get some love.

Don't overthink it. We love this guy. Fuck you and lets make some money:

2338,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"Ok so I was long RKT since IPO. I recently doubled down and bought 100 option contacts for $0.64 at the most recent dip after earnings. I have 300 shares and 100 contracts call for Jan 2022 strike $33.

Is UWMC that much better that I should ditch RKT? If so please explain.

I know RKT guidance is down but 


- the P/E ratio of under 7 is extremely cheap

- They have a great current ratio

- They are profitable which is great during inflation times like now. Revenue and earnings are steady in guidance for the next two years 

- Possible addition to S&P 500

- Dominant name in the industry


This is a conversation around fundamentals. If UWMC is a pure short squeeze I understand but I think RKT is so much better than it’s valued or forecasted to perform relative to other stocks in the broader market.

2340,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"As many are aware, the 13F for Michael Burry’s hedge fund was released on Monday. His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that’s why I’m not Dr. Burry. I’m sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I’m posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I’m missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn’t detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I’m thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT. The fed claims this inflation is transitory, but I don’t think anyone on the street buys it. I think rates have to come up at least a little bit sometime between now and next January.

If there’s anything else I should be considering for this trade please comment, I’m interested in hearing other opinions on this.

The first known instance of the word ""meme stocks"" in the legal lexicon. Consolidated on April Fool's day, 2021.

If you read those footnotes, you can see that some judges on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (which is 7 very qualified federal judges) have recused themselves and others have had to renounce their claims (normal for judges) against the defendants to even participate, as they would have been members of the several putative actions.

1.**The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets—i.e., much more dollar printing.**

**Let me dig in !**

The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion.

NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over “confidence” index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *“actually”* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *“demand”* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ew6w5tu19vz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bba4677ec15d513e78d6d19644722b133068a48

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***“pulled forward”***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***“costs”*** **of** ***“long-term employment”*** **for a** ***“short-term”*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.** Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bcfon349vz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b498f76db582407f08e593e10dc5692e6005f2

 

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w1cuikh69vz61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b01f66a5badd3fc80e79abecd97096e309324a5

 

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it’ll be worse than expected:**

We finally got “official” confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It’s not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don’t hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time—i.e., the CPI is likely going even higher. 

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a “return to work bonus” in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one’s wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact. Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. For Silver q2 /2021 my targets are 42 Usd /ozz while gold 1.900 Usd/ozz .

GOOD JOB! TAX THE SHORTS! 

The 7.50c line held strong and the stock kept the Friday gains and pushed a bit more.

UWMC is obviously picking up some steam here on Reddit with spillover into many other stock-related platforms (yahoo, twits, alpha, etc). That chatter will certainly help continue the push.

Up some change in Pre-market for what it's worth but should only get better throughout the day.

This is a powder keg ready to go as soon as the 9c's go in the money. If we can exercise at 7.50 and 9 (EXERCISE FRIDAY 5/21 IF YOU CAN FRONT THE Cash!!!).

I suggest exercising even if you are 0.01$ ITM.

The Volume 05/17 was impressive at 17M (8M average) so there is certainly upwards pressure due to buying volume.

Another 2 days like yesterday and those 9c start printing, then it is really off the races and not messing with 8,10% and instead watching a serious gap UP.

Hopes some powder was saved for the push to 9c . I will be buying a few more shares today once some other options are sold for liquidity.

Position:I am loaded up on 6/18 8c and LEAPS. I still really like UWMC long-term but this short-term profit potential is simply staggering.

UWMC looks really good for breaking 9 by Thursday, we already have the 7.50c's ready to print from the push last week, then it's TO THE MOON as those options are exercised. 9c needs to hit this week to hit 12-14 (minimum) next week.

Hi everyone, I’m here with another DD, but this time it’ll be a little different than my usual options-exclusive DD. Today, IQ has just released its 2021 Q1 result. I’ve seen a couple posts on iQIYI two years before and it seems to be the time to short squeeze it again. It has reached its historical low at servals data before, but it soon rebound for 5% after the financial statement is released. However, me and my team did a deep dive into IQ and I wanted to share this stock with you

&#x200B;

What is IQ?

iQIYI Inc is an online entertainment service provider in China and it is known as the ""Netflix of China"". It is valued at around 10 billion dollars currently. It is primarily engaged in providing a variety of services encompassing internet video, live broadcasting, online games, online literature, animations, e-commerce and social media platform. The company produces original video content and distributes appealing professionally-produced content, partner-generated content, and user-generated content. It also offers a diverse collection of internet video content that appeals to users from broad demographics. The company's revenue is generated from membership services and online advertising services. The company earns the majority of its revenue from China. The company is based in Beijing and is partly owned by Baidu, the ""Google of China"". It had its IPO in 2018 and is currently sitting at around $13.3 per share.

&#x200B;

How is IQ 2021 Q1 financial report?

Total revenues reached RMB8.0 billion (US$1.2 billion), representing a 4% increase from the same period in 2020 and beat the estimate of $1,180,000,000.

Membership services revenue was RMB4.3 billion (US$658.1 million), representing a 7% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the decline of our subscribing members from 118.9 million as of March 31, 2020, which was a high base due to the impact of Covid-19, to 105.3 million as of March 31, 2021. Our subscribing members grew 3.6 million quarter-on-quarter due to the strong content launch coupled with the holidays in the first quarter, during which people spent more time viewing content.

Online advertising services revenue was RMB1.9 billion (US$292.5 million), representing a 25% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the rebound of both brand-advertising budgets and the number of brand advertisers amid the macroeconomy recovery.

Content distribution revenue was RMB779.1 million (US$118.9 million), representing a 29% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by more content titles we distributed to other platforms during the quarter.

Other revenues were RMB961.0 million (US$146.7 million), representing a 10% increase from the same period in 2020, primarily due to the growth of certain business lines.

Cost of revenues was RMB7.1 billion (US$1.1 billion), representing a 10% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to less content costs and bandwidth cost during the quarter. Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB5.4 billion (US$829.6 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to decline of licensed content cost.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB1.2 billion (US$183.3 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. This was primarily attribute to less provision for credit losses, which was a result of improved macroeconomic environment versus the same period last year.

Research and development expenses were RMB672.3 million (US$102.6 million), representing a 1% decrease from the same period in 2020.

Operating loss was RMB1.0 billion (US$154.8 million), compared to operating loss of RMB2.2 billion in the same period in 2020. Operating loss margin was 13%, compared to operating loss margin of 29% in the same period in 2020.

Total other expense was RMB222.4 million (US$34.0 million), compared to total other expense of RMB628.5 million during the same period of 2020. The year-over-year variance was mainly due to less foreign exchange loss.

Loss before income taxes was RMB1.2 billion (US$188.7 million), compared to loss before income taxes of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020.

Income tax expense was RMB20.6 million (US$3.1 million), compared to income tax expense of RMB4.8 million in the same period in 2020.

Net loss attributable to iQIYI was RMB1.3 billion (US$193.4 million), compared to net loss attributable to iQIYI of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020. Diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS was RMB1.61 (US$0.25) for the first quarter of 2021, compared to diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS of RMB3.92 in the same period of 2020.

As of March 31, 2021, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB13.3 billion (US$2.0 billion).

&#x200B;

Financial Guidance

For the second quarter of 2021, iQIYI expects total net revenues to be between RMB7.21 billion (US$1.10 billion) and RMB7.65 billion (US$1.17 billion), representing a 3% decrease to a 3% increase year over year. This forecast reflects iQIYI's current and preliminary view, which may be subject to change.

Price Target

If we use Netflix valuation as a benchmark. We can estimate the fair market value of IQ being at least equivalent to NFLX at 216B ($480/share). However, I personally think IQ should garner less since it main business is in China while Netflix is in America, Canada, Europe, you name it. Also, the subscription member of Netflix is about 207 million while IQ has only half of it, which is 105 million. Also, the member revenues of Netflix is about 24.7 billion, while that of IQ is only 4.3 billion. IQ has only about 18% of revenues of Netflix and so give IQ an $86/share target price. But my price target for the entire company is at least $200/share as it has half of the membership service of Netflix and it is still growing for IQ. Also, there is a large room of growth for IQ as it mainly focus on mainland nowadays but it will sure expand its business overseas",nfbmkd,[],0
2352,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"This pure focus on wholesale means UWMC does not spend as much cost on the servicing and advertising necessary to sustain a large retail business like for RKT. Overall, UWMC actually has had consistently higher net income margin than RKT, currently sitting at 68% vs. 58% for RKT.

UWMC's focus on wholesaling and working entirely with brokers makes it much easier for it to pivot to home purchase originations, which Freddie Mac actually predicts will grow 16% by 2022. Home purchases are more complex than refinances and the value of using a broker shines in those cases. In fact, UWMC is already more heavy on home purchases than its competitors. In the most recent quarter, 25% of its volume came from home purchases. Furthermore, a rise in interest rates may actually benefit UWMC in that the value of the loans they generate will be higher due to the higher cash flows.",nfbwv5,[],0

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a **fantastic setup**.

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

2356,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"[Here](https://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/isa-furthers-its-partnership-with-beyond-meat-with-the-certification-of-the-new-iteration-of-the-beyond-burger) is one of the many articles stating that as of today BYND burgers are now HALAL certified.   


If you don't know what Halal is or why this is relevant then you are probably not Muslim or Hindu. The certification will now give BYND a huge customer base boost in my opinion. Impossible Burgers did this in 2018 so the alternative meat market in the UAE has already been introduced. I think BYND is set to capitalize on this new certification especially as meat markets are already negatively impacted from COVID issues.   


$BYND also is sitting >20% short float so any upward movement in this stock could potentially start a quick move up. The stock is sitting near $100 and to me looks to be at a nice floor psychologically ($100 is a nice round bottom for people to buy near).   


Finally the OATLY IPO is coming quick. The alternative meat / protein space will likely be the talk of the town at near the end of the week which may bring BYND up or down with it as the IPO happens. The good ole sympathy trade...   


Disclosure: No I'm not muslim / hindu but I do have family that is. This certification gives them ""confidence"" that during the holidays they can still eat this food. It also allows them to serve this food at events, which is something I know has been an issue in the past for us personally. If it's not Halal it won't be served at a party / event.",nfh8o2,[],1

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit’s Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‘buy’ recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

BEFORE you make any investment decision in Corn, let’s run through these important things:
1. WHO grows corn?
The 2 leading producers of corn include the US at 1 and China at 2 that is over 50% of total production. 
2. WHO consumes Corn?
Well… it’s The US and China accounting for over 50% of total consumption

These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil. 
-The absence of supply chain disruptions which, let’s face it, is not the theme so far in 2021.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

Another thing that I noticed was that the large spikes were only attributed to changes from medium to high regimes.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

2578,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"I don't normally play meme stocks - but I thought the GME technical setup was especially intriguing recently.

[GME TA](https://preview.redd.it/1tmj448o6sz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=1de6593bb253ff2a102250d3e4a97d521e0b3455)

The setup is a symmetrical triangle. Normally when continuation patterns come from downside - they have a bearish bias. However - we broke that red trendline  with an uptick in volume - this was a hint we were ready for an actual reversal. That trendline kept us in a downtrend for about 4 months. Not only that but...

**TODAY WE BROKE THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE UP - WHICH MEANS ITS FULL SPEED AHEAD!**

Confluence between technicals generate the best signals.

This is the best the setup has looked since GME was at 10. Price target for this is 231.52 resistance initially, followed by 348.50. Breakout is invalid and play is dead if we get a daily close back under 158.11.

And... that's it.

I've been trading for a long time and only use patterns, trendlines & volume. Keep it simple. You don't need to waste 100 hours doing 15 paragraphs of DD for one swing trade - or look at 100 different indicators cherry picking the ones that say your position will go up.

***TL;DR*** \- GME actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

***EDIT:*** Clarification - I wasn't speaking for GME as a whole when I said it was dead under 158.11 - I simply meant this setup in particular was no longer valid. It could always form a new one. I chose that level because it's the most significant one below the breakout point.

Edit 2: Not Financial Advice (i thought that was a given)

Edit 3: It's back testing so far - really common in Technical Analysis. Price will retrace the pattern it broke from before deciding direction. Focused on the daily close to determine whether it's a fake breakout (when a stock closes back inside a pattern the candle after breaking out) - which happens.

Edit 4: Backtested - and bouncing so far.

Really important to reclaim 174.26 on the hourly close. You can see we bounced off this zone from 168.07 - 167.55 - that's key demand or support.
 
https://ibb.co/XS1t1dL

Edit 5: Reclaimed 174.26 - back tested that as well. Key levels are normally retraced as we move. Price wants to confirm that resistance has become a support.
Now, 174.26 must hold as support - and we are looking pretty good.

https://ibb.co/fCrq0Fb

Edit 6: Bull flagging now into lunch time, New support put up at 176.48. Constructive.

https://ibb.co/3WTR25r

Edit 7: Great breakout from that flag. New support put up at 181.50. Still need the 1:45 close for confirmation. Look at the volume on that candle - shorts trying to defend this breakout with their lives.

https://ibb.co/cFHv6W6

Edit 8: Keyboard warriors storming my DMs at open - quit trading, you are more driven by your emotions than a teenage girl.

Self proclaimed geniuses saying ""TA Doesn't Work On GME, Ban"" - it's not that TA doesn't work on GME: 
The issue is - all the TA you guys normally upvote is done by some kid who watched three YouTube videos on it the night before. I don't blame you for feeling that way though - so many of these people the past few months with the influx of retail in trading. 

Just because you don't understand something and are afraid to admit it, doesn't mean you should dismiss it.

The sheer amount of hate GME posts get on this sub is a super bullish data point honestly - insane how sentiment shifted. You guys are getting played like a fiddle. The tutes have been pushing this thing both ways the whole time and using you all as a scapegoat.

Lastly I, appreciate the people who have been messaging me with legitimate questions eager to learn. DMs are open.

Edit 9: 189.00 is the next resistance coming up - careful there. Like I said, 181.50 is the new support to hold. Still on track for my price targets. Volume is in all the right spots.

Edit 10: Backtested & we are moving again. Support is actually a zone from 182.51 - 181.50. Notice how the volume on that red candle was literally nothing compared to the prior two. Remember some resistance at 189.00 - might flag there the rest of the day.

https://ibb.co/hyj7mrf

Edit 11 [3:13 P.M. 5/18/2021]: Notice how every candle we aren't making new highs has decreased volume. Still bullish consolidation below this key 189.00 resistance. Above there, straight to 200+. Shorts going to fight for their lives this last hour. I'm watching this rising channel in yellow to dictate the near-term trend.

https://ibb.co/R634KNj

Edit 12 [3:46 P.M. 5/18/2021]: They got the close just below the uptrend. Not a great sign - but only a 15m trend so not too damning. 
We need to hold 182.51 - 181.50. They are going to try and test that now. Shorts doing everything they can to dump this thing before we close to high up.
Still garbage volume on the red candles which is encouraging. Literally no volume the last hour as we trend down.

https://ibb.co/VpDJQr0

Edit 12 [4:01 P.M. 5/18/2021]: Not an awful close - but definitely not a great one. Shorts fought hard end of day - the fuckers. They know if we break 189 they are done for. Important thing though - breakout is still intact. Also - broader market dumped hard end of day which didn't help.

Tomorrow - will be looking for 173.02 and 167.57 to hold - and looking for 182.54 to break (as well as 189.00).

https://ibb.co/5YcfNmG

This post isn't intended to draw away from that, just an opportunity that I see and would like to share. This play is based on $AMCs undoubtable liftoff to $30+.

AMC READY TO FLY.

Plenty of DD has been done on AMC and why its going to take off - I'm not here to talk about that. It is coiled, has popped, and is ready to rip a new butthole in the sky.

$CNK is AMCs largest competitor and is in the great business we know as movie theaters. When AMC last went crazy, CNK ran up over 56% in a few days from 22-27 of January to $27+. In the past month, AMC is up over 50%. CNK is roughly even. It is lagging behind and is due for a major pop on this AMC craze. It is a classically more boring stock that takes a big nudge to move.

Breaking out similar to AMC. Insanely strong volume shelf in low 20s (high demand) and above 1D 21MA. RSI has lots of room to run. 

**MARGIN**

CNK has a much lower implied volatility and actually allows for margin borrowing. This could be attractive depending on your risk appetite

**DILUTION/FINANCIALS**

CNK has almost no share dilution since the pandemic started, and it has been historically stronger than AMC from a traditional (retarded) financial perspective. AMCs market value growth has passed CNKs by many multiples over the past year. No reason she can't get some love.

2588,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"As many are aware, the 13F for Michael Burry’s hedge fund was released on Monday. His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that’s why I’m not Dr. Burry. I’m sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I’m posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I’m missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn’t detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I’m thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT. The fed claims this inflation is transitory, but I don’t think anyone on the street buys it. I think rates have to come up at least a little bit sometime between now and next January.

If there’s anything else I should be considering for this trade please comment, I’m interested in hearing other opinions on this.

2591,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"I was doing some research on cybersecurity and data breach multidistrict litigations (MDLs are often some of the biggest litigation efforts in the US), when what do I spy as the most recent MDL to be consolidated?

MDL 2989:  IN RE: January 2021 Short Squeeze Trading Litigation.

The first known instance of the word ""meme stocks"" in the legal lexicon. Consolidated on April Fool's day, 2021.

What does this mean? It means that so many people filed lawsuits, including class actions, that they had to be consolidated into a single court as to avoid duplicitous litigation; very normal these days, but also indicative that this is a big deal legally speaking. Receiving an MDL assignment is considered very prestigious for a federal judge because it takes so much personal involvement and the cases often affect many, *many* people plus the state of the law more generally.

If you read those footnotes, you can see that some judges on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (which is 7 very qualified federal judges) have recused themselves and others have had to renounce their claims (normal for judges) against the defendants to even participate, as they would have been members of the several putative actions. Meaning: one or more judges just on this small panel were holding meme stock at the time, if not currently.",nf7s3u,[],0

1.**The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets—i.e., much more dollar printing.**

**Let me dig in !**

The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion.

NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over “confidence” index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *“actually”* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *“demand”* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ew6w5tu19vz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bba4677ec15d513e78d6d19644722b133068a48

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***“pulled forward”***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***“costs”*** **of** ***“long-term employment”*** **for a** ***“short-term”*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.** Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bcfon349vz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b498f76db582407f08e593e10dc5692e6005f2

 

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w1cuikh69vz61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b01f66a5badd3fc80e79abecd97096e309324a5

 

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it’ll be worse than expected:**

We finally got “official” confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It’s not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don’t hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time—i.e., the CPI is likely going even higher. 

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a “return to work bonus” in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one’s wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact. Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. For Silver q2 /2021 my targets are 42 Usd /ozz while gold 1.900 Usd/ozz .

GOOD JOB! TAX THE SHORTS! 

The 7.50c line held strong and the stock kept the Friday gains and pushed a bit more.

UWMC is obviously picking up some steam here on Reddit with spillover into many other stock-related platforms (yahoo, twits, alpha, etc). That chatter will certainly help continue the push.

Up some change in Pre-market for what it's worth but should only get better throughout the day.

This is a powder keg ready to go as soon as the 9c's go in the money. If we can exercise at 7.50 and 9 (EXERCISE FRIDAY 5/21 IF YOU CAN FRONT THE Cash!!!).

I suggest exercising even if you are 0.01$ ITM.

The Volume 05/17 was impressive at 17M (8M average) so there is certainly upwards pressure due to buying volume.

Another 2 days like yesterday and those 9c start printing, then it is really off the races and not messing with 8,10% and instead watching a serious gap UP.

Hopes some powder was saved for the push to 9c . I will be buying a few more shares today once some other options are sold for liquidity.

Position:I am loaded up on 6/18 8c and LEAPS. I still really like UWMC long-term but this short-term profit potential is simply staggering.

UWMC looks really good for breaking 9 by Thursday, we already have the 7.50c's ready to print from the push last week, then it's TO THE MOON as those options are exercised. 9c needs to hit this week to hit 12-14 (minimum) next week.

LETS GET FUCKING PAID!

* Bulls need to keep it above 415
* Look for some resistance around 417-418
* Major residences at 420
* Bears need to. hold 417-418 and then plow through 415 support
* Bullish pt: 419.29 - 420 - 421.20 - 422.71
* Bearish pt: 413.67 - 412.49 - 411 - 410

* Tested bottom range of gap fill for support.
* If it fails we may see the second half of the w-shape recovery form. We could see a few days of downside if we close below 415 IMO.

2599,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"Disclaimer and Risks: This is not a financial advice. Be cautious to bet against Winnie the Pooh🐻. One major risk factor is the fact that BIDU owns 53.08% of IQ, and even more worrisome is that about 30% of BIDU’s revenue in 2021 stems from IQ. Whether or not China will intervene to prevent the plunge in value of its own version of Google is unknown, but is certainly a risk that should be hedged against. I’m very confident on this trade and have verified some of the more important arguments lined in the paper, but as always do your own DD and hedge appropriately.

&#x200B;

Hi everyone, I’m here with another DD, but this time it’ll be a little different than my usual options-exclusive DD. Today, IQ has just released its 2021 Q1 result. I’ve seen a couple posts on iQIYI two years before and it seems to be the time to short squeeze it again. It has reached its historical low at servals data before, but it soon rebound for 5% after the financial statement is released. However, me and my team did a deep dive into IQ and I wanted to share this stock with you

&#x200B;

What is IQ?

iQIYI Inc is an online entertainment service provider in China and it is known as the ""Netflix of China"". It is valued at around 10 billion dollars currently. It is primarily engaged in providing a variety of services encompassing internet video, live broadcasting, online games, online literature, animations, e-commerce and social media platform. The company produces original video content and distributes appealing professionally-produced content, partner-generated content, and user-generated content. It also offers a diverse collection of internet video content that appeals to users from broad demographics. The company's revenue is generated from membership services and online advertising services. The company earns the majority of its revenue from China. The company is based in Beijing and is partly owned by Baidu, the ""Google of China"". It had its IPO in 2018 and is currently sitting at around $13.3 per share.

&#x200B;

How is IQ 2021 Q1 financial report?

Total revenues reached RMB8.0 billion (US$1.2 billion), representing a 4% increase from the same period in 2020 and beat the estimate of $1,180,000,000.

Membership services revenue was RMB4.3 billion (US$658.1 million), representing a 7% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the decline of our subscribing members from 118.9 million as of March 31, 2020, which was a high base due to the impact of Covid-19, to 105.3 million as of March 31, 2021. Our subscribing members grew 3.6 million quarter-on-quarter due to the strong content launch coupled with the holidays in the first quarter, during which people spent more time viewing content.

Online advertising services revenue was RMB1.9 billion (US$292.5 million), representing a 25% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the rebound of both brand-advertising budgets and the number of brand advertisers amid the macroeconomy recovery.

Content distribution revenue was RMB779.1 million (US$118.9 million), representing a 29% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by more content titles we distributed to other platforms during the quarter.

Other revenues were RMB961.0 million (US$146.7 million), representing a 10% increase from the same period in 2020, primarily due to the growth of certain business lines.

Cost of revenues was RMB7.1 billion (US$1.1 billion), representing a 10% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to less content costs and bandwidth cost during the quarter. Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB5.4 billion (US$829.6 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to decline of licensed content cost.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB1.2 billion (US$183.3 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. This was primarily attribute to less provision for credit losses, which was a result of improved macroeconomic environment versus the same period last year.

Research and development expenses were RMB672.3 million (US$102.6 million), representing a 1% decrease from the same period in 2020.

Operating loss was RMB1.0 billion (US$154.8 million), compared to operating loss of RMB2.2 billion in the same period in 2020. Operating loss margin was 13%, compared to operating loss margin of 29% in the same period in 2020.

Total other expense was RMB222.4 million (US$34.0 million), compared to total other expense of RMB628.5 million during the same period of 2020. The year-over-year variance was mainly due to less foreign exchange loss.

Loss before income taxes was RMB1.2 billion (US$188.7 million), compared to loss before income taxes of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020.

Income tax expense was RMB20.6 million (US$3.1 million), compared to income tax expense of RMB4.8 million in the same period in 2020.

Net loss attributable to iQIYI was RMB1.3 billion (US$193.4 million), compared to net loss attributable to iQIYI of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020. Diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS was RMB1.61 (US$0.25) for the first quarter of 2021, compared to diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS of RMB3.92 in the same period of 2020.

As of March 31, 2021, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB13.3 billion (US$2.0 billion).

&#x200B;

Financial Guidance

For the second quarter of 2021, iQIYI expects total net revenues to be between RMB7.21 billion (US$1.10 billion) and RMB7.65 billion (US$1.17 billion), representing a 3% decrease to a 3% increase year over year. This forecast reflects iQIYI's current and preliminary view, which may be subject to change.

Price Target

If we use Netflix valuation as a benchmark. We can estimate the fair market value of IQ being at least equivalent to NFLX at 216B ($480/share). However, I personally think IQ should garner less since it main business is in China while Netflix is in America, Canada, Europe, you name it. Also, the subscription member of Netflix is about 207 million while IQ has only half of it, which is 105 million. Also, the member revenues of Netflix is about 24.7 billion, while that of IQ is only 4.3 billion. IQ has only about 18% of revenues of Netflix and so give IQ an $86/share target price. But my price target for the entire company is at least $200/share as it has half of the membership service of Netflix and it is still growing for IQ. Also, there is a large room of growth for IQ as it mainly focus on mainland nowadays but it will sure expand its business overseas",nfbmkd,[],0
2600,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"This pure focus on wholesale means UWMC does not spend as much cost on the servicing and advertising necessary to sustain a large retail business like for RKT. Overall, UWMC actually has had consistently higher net income margin than RKT, currently sitting at 68% vs. 58% for RKT.

UWMC's focus on wholesaling and working entirely with brokers makes it much easier for it to pivot to home purchase originations, which Freddie Mac actually predicts will grow 16% by 2022. Home purchases are more complex than refinances and the value of using a broker shines in those cases. In fact, UWMC is already more heavy on home purchases than its competitors. In the most recent quarter, 25% of its volume came from home purchases. Furthermore, a rise in interest rates may actually benefit UWMC in that the value of the loans they generate will be higher due to the higher cash flows.",nfbwv5,[],0

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

Edit: Only thing I forgot to mention was the upper trendline of the wedge extends back to that 17.25 high - this is just another data point that adds to the validity of the breakout.",nfg8mj,"['GME', 'AMC']",1

If you don't know what Halal is or why this is relevant then you are probably not Muslim or Hindu. The certification will now give BYND a huge customer base boost in my opinion. Impossible Burgers did this in 2018 so the alternative meat market in the UAE has already been introduced. I think BYND is set to capitalize on this new certification especially as meat markets are already negatively impacted from COVID issues.   


$BYND also is sitting >20% short float so any upward movement in this stock could potentially start a quick move up. The stock is sitting near $100 and to me looks to be at a nice floor psychologically ($100 is a nice round bottom for people to buy near).   


Finally the OATLY IPO is coming quick. The alternative meat / protein space will likely be the talk of the town at near the end of the week which may bring BYND up or down with it as the IPO happens. The good ole sympathy trade...   


Disclosure: No I'm not muslim / hindu but I do have family that is. This certification gives them ""confidence"" that during the holidays they can still eat this food. It also allows them to serve this food at events, which is something I know has been an issue in the past for us personally. If it's not Halal it won't be served at a party / event.",nfh8o2,[],1

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit’s Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‘buy’ recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

1. WHO grows corn?
The 2 leading producers of corn include the US at 1 and China at 2 that is over 50% of total production. 
2. WHO consumes Corn?
Well… it’s The US and China accounting for over 50% of total consumption

These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

2651,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Gold is for the most part useless. Similar to other nameless 'inflation hedges' that provide almost 0 current real world value. Might as well be beanie babies. However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

Positions:

June 21 GLD 174c. And i'll be rollin.

June 21 GOLD 27c.",ng50po,[],0

3447,2021-05-17,wallstreetbets,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

This is not financial advice, this is a layup. But seriously, i'm not a financial advisor, and you do you with your money.

**Netflix has a history conducting hit jobs on struggling companies and taking their customers.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TL:DR: My Thesis**

I think Netflix was secretly trying to drive these companies into the ground and hold their heads underwater with their hedgy henchmen. Their plan was within sight with the Lockdowns as both companies were hit hard. They were very close and slotted for BlockBusters fate until **we stepped in and fucked it up**. With everyone straped into their couches this last year binging tiger king how do you increase revenue? They've been trading sidways ever since. Now Netflix is fucked. The release of Cuties shot themselves in the foot (lost 800,000) viewers at such a competitive time in the streaming sector.

Karma's a bitch, just like my stepmom: Netflix has it coming, and that's why I'm not very tall and I hear they have hedges in between the Eiffel tower. *yeah you like that?*

&#x200B;

I personally just don't like Netflix as a company, and for that ***I don't like the stock***

3453,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"As an avid investor, I often speak with financial advisors about where I should be putting my money. Of course, with any new administration comes a new stock set to explode and others set to fall. The financial advisors whom I have spoken with have advised me to stay away from oil and coal and to start putting more and more money into renewable energy ETFs and companies. The two stocks that they projected would gain the most are listed below. 
- FuelCell Energy (FCEL) 
- iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) 
These two are predicted to skyrocket under the Biden administration due to his push for renewable energy, especially if the Green New Deal is passed.

3455,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"I don't normally play meme stocks - but I thought the GME technical setup was especially intriguing recently.

The setup is a symmetrical triangle. Normally when continuation patterns come from downside - they have a bearish bias. However - we broke that red trendline  with an uptick in volume - this was a hint we were ready for an actual reversal. That trendline kept us in a downtrend for about 4 months. Not only that but...

**TODAY WE BROKE THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE UP - WHICH MEANS ITS FULL SPEED AHEAD!**

Confluence between technicals generate the best signals.

This is the best the setup has looked since GME was at 10. Price target for this is 231.52 resistance initially, followed by 348.50. Breakout is invalid and play is dead if we get a daily close back under 158.11.

And... that's it.

I've been trading for a long time and only use patterns, trendlines & volume. Keep it simple. You don't need to waste 100 hours doing 15 paragraphs of DD for one swing trade - or look at 100 different indicators cherry picking the ones that say your position will go up.

***TL;DR*** \- GME actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

***EDIT:*** Clarification - I wasn't speaking for GME as a whole when I said it was dead under 158.11 - I simply meant this setup in particular was no longer valid. It could always form a new one. I chose that level because it's the most significant one below the breakout point.

Edit 2: Not Financial Advice (i thought that was a given)

Edit 3: It's back testing so far - really common in Technical Analysis. Price will retrace the pattern it broke from before deciding direction. Focused on the daily close to determine whether it's a fake breakout (when a stock closes back inside a pattern the candle after breaking out) - which happens.

Edit 4: Backtested - and bouncing so far.

Really important to reclaim 174.26 on the hourly close. You can see we bounced off this zone from 168.07 - 167.55 - that's key demand or support.
 
https://ibb.co/XS1t1dL

Edit 5: Reclaimed 174.26 - back tested that as well. Key levels are normally retraced as we move. Price wants to confirm that resistance has become a support.
Now, 174.26 must hold as support - and we are looking pretty good.

https://ibb.co/fCrq0Fb

Edit 6: Bull flagging now into lunch time, New support put up at 176.48. Constructive.

https://ibb.co/3WTR25r

Edit 7: Great breakout from that flag. New support put up at 181.50. Still need the 1:45 close for confirmation. Look at the volume on that candle - shorts trying to defend this breakout with their lives.

https://ibb.co/cFHv6W6

Edit 8: Keyboard warriors storming my DMs at open - quit trading, you are more driven by your emotions than a teenage girl.

Self proclaimed geniuses saying ""TA Doesn't Work On GME, Ban"" - it's not that TA doesn't work on GME: 
The issue is - all the TA you guys normally upvote is done by some kid who watched three YouTube videos on it the night before. I don't blame you for feeling that way though - so many of these people the past few months with the influx of retail in trading. 

Just because you don't understand something and are afraid to admit it, doesn't mean you should dismiss it.

The sheer amount of hate GME posts get on this sub is a super bullish data point honestly - insane how sentiment shifted. You guys are getting played like a fiddle. The tutes have been pushing this thing both ways the whole time and using you all as a scapegoat.

Lastly I, appreciate the people who have been messaging me with legitimate questions eager to learn. DMs are open.

Edit 9: 189.00 is the next resistance coming up - careful there. Like I said, 181.50 is the new support to hold. Still on track for my price targets. Volume is in all the right spots.

Edit 10: Backtested & we are moving again. Support is actually a zone from 182.51 - 181.50. Notice how the volume on that red candle was literally nothing compared to the prior two. Remember some resistance at 189.00 - might flag there the rest of the day.

https://ibb.co/hyj7mrf

Edit 11 [3:13 P.M. 5/18/2021]: Notice how every candle we aren't making new highs has decreased volume. Still bullish consolidation below this key 189.00 resistance. Above there, straight to 200+. Shorts going to fight for their lives this last hour. I'm watching this rising channel in yellow to dictate the near-term trend.

https://ibb.co/R634KNj

Edit 12 [3:46 P.M. 5/18/2021]: They got the close just below the uptrend. Not a great sign - but only a 15m trend so not too damning. 
We need to hold 182.51 - 181.50. They are going to try and test that now. Shorts doing everything they can to dump this thing before we close to high up.
Still garbage volume on the red candles which is encouraging. Literally no volume the last hour as we trend down.

https://ibb.co/VpDJQr0

Edit 12 [4:01 P.M. 5/18/2021]: Not an awful close - but definitely not a great one. Shorts fought hard end of day - the fuckers. They know if we break 189 they are done for. Important thing though - breakout is still intact. Also - broader market dumped hard end of day which didn't help.

Tomorrow - will be looking for 173.02 and 167.57 to hold - and looking for 182.54 to break (as well as 189.00).

https://ibb.co/5YcfNmG

Hope regardless of the end result you guys can pull some knowledge from this. Appreciate all the awards. Keep in mind this is a swing trade so could take a couple weeks to play out. Will probably move quicker since it’s GME.",nexq9s,['GME'],0
3458,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"Before I say anything and you ape crustfucks bend me over in the comments - I believe $AMC is about to fly. This post isn't intended to draw away from that, just an opportunity that I see and would like to share. This play is based on $AMCs undoubtable liftoff to $30+.

AMC READY TO FLY.

Plenty of DD has been done on AMC and why its going to take off - I'm not here to talk about that. It is coiled, has popped, and is ready to rip a new butthole in the sky.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/co13u0s3hsz61.png?width=2685&format=png&auto=webp&s=99b295c5af11bdccf9e70237aacc3be81e313bf6

$CNK is AMCs largest competitor and is in the great business we know as movie theaters. When AMC last went crazy, CNK ran up over 56% in a few days from 22-27 of January to $27+. In the past month, AMC is up over 50%. CNK is roughly even. It is lagging behind and is due for a major pop on this AMC craze. It is a classically more boring stock that takes a big nudge to move. 

**CHART**

https://preview.redd.it/o5kx7cgjisz61.png?width=2684&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b4885682006b318bee81193abdfbc1700d87a7a

Breaking out similar to AMC. Insanely strong volume shelf in low 20s (high demand) and above 1D 21MA. RSI has lots of room to run. 

**MARGIN**

CNK has a much lower implied volatility and actually allows for margin borrowing. This could be attractive depending on your risk appetite

**DILUTION/FINANCIALS**

CNK has almost no share dilution since the pandemic started, and it has been historically stronger than AMC from a traditional (retarded) financial perspective. AMCs market value growth has passed CNKs by many multiples over the past year. No reason she can't get some love.

Don't overthink it. We love this guy. Fuck you and lets make some money:

Is UWMC that much better that I should ditch RKT? If so please explain.

I know RKT guidance is down but 


- the P/E ratio of under 7 is extremely cheap

- They have a great current ratio

- They are profitable which is great during inflation times like now. Revenue and earnings are steady in guidance for the next two years 

- Possible addition to S&P 500

- Dominant name in the industry


This is a conversation around fundamentals. If UWMC is a pure short squeeze I understand but I think RKT is so much better than it’s valued or forecasted to perform relative to other stocks in the broader market.

3465,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"As many are aware, the 13F for Michael Burry’s hedge fund was released on Monday. His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that’s why I’m not Dr. Burry. I’m sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I’m posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I’m missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn’t detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I’m thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT. The fed claims this inflation is transitory, but I don’t think anyone on the street buys it. I think rates have to come up at least a little bit sometime between now and next January.

If there’s anything else I should be considering for this trade please comment, I’m interested in hearing other opinions on this.

MDL 2989:  IN RE: January 2021 Short Squeeze Trading Litigation.

The first known instance of the word ""meme stocks"" in the legal lexicon. Consolidated on April Fool's day, 2021.

All active MDL dockets:

What does this mean? It means that so many people filed lawsuits, including class actions, that they had to be consolidated into a single court as to avoid duplicitous litigation; very normal these days, but also indicative that this is a big deal legally speaking.

If you read those footnotes, you can see that some judges on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (which is 7 very qualified federal judges) have recused themselves and others have had to renounce their claims (normal for judges) against the defendants to even participate, as they would have been members of the several putative actions.

1.**The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets—i.e., much more dollar printing.**

**Let me dig in !**

The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion.

NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over “confidence” index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *“actually”* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *“demand”* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ew6w5tu19vz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bba4677ec15d513e78d6d19644722b133068a48

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***“pulled forward”***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***“costs”*** **of** ***“long-term employment”*** **for a** ***“short-term”*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.** Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bcfon349vz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b498f76db582407f08e593e10dc5692e6005f2

 

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

&#x200B;

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it’ll be worse than expected:**

We finally got “official” confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It’s not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don’t hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time—i.e., the CPI is likely going even higher. 

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a “return to work bonus” in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one’s wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

GOOD JOB! TAX THE SHORTS! 

The 7.50c line held strong and the stock kept the Friday gains and pushed a bit more.

UWMC is obviously picking up some steam here on Reddit with spillover into many other stock-related platforms (yahoo, twits, alpha, etc). That chatter will certainly help continue the push.

Up some change in Pre-market for what it's worth but should only get better throughout the day.

This is a powder keg ready to go as soon as the 9c's go in the money. If we can exercise at 7.50 and 9 (EXERCISE FRIDAY 5/21 IF YOU CAN FRONT THE Cash!!!).

I suggest exercising even if you are 0.01$ ITM.

The Volume 05/17 was impressive at 17M (8M average) so there is certainly upwards pressure due to buying volume.

Another 2 days like yesterday and those 9c start printing, then it is really off the races and not messing with 8,10% and instead watching a serious gap UP.

Hopes some powder was saved for the push to 9c . I will be buying a few more shares today once some other options are sold for liquidity.

Position:I am loaded up on 6/18 8c and LEAPS. I still really like UWMC long-term but this short-term profit potential is simply staggering.

UWMC looks really good for breaking 9 by Thursday, we already have the 7.50c's ready to print from the push last week, then it's TO THE MOON as those options are exercised. 9c needs to hit this week to hit 12-14 (minimum) next week.

3476,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"Disclaimer and Risks: This is not a financial advice. Be cautious to bet against Winnie the Pooh🐻. One major risk factor is the fact that BIDU owns 53.08% of IQ, and even more worrisome is that about 30% of BIDU’s revenue in 2021 stems from IQ. Whether or not China will intervene to prevent the plunge in value of its own version of Google is unknown, but is certainly a risk that should be hedged against. I’m very confident on this trade and have verified some of the more important arguments lined in the paper, but as always do your own DD and hedge appropriately.

&#x200B;

Hi everyone, I’m here with another DD, but this time it’ll be a little different than my usual options-exclusive DD. Today, IQ has just released its 2021 Q1 result. I’ve seen a couple posts on iQIYI two years before and it seems to be the time to short squeeze it again. It has reached its historical low at servals data before, but it soon rebound for 5% after the financial statement is released. However, me and my team did a deep dive into IQ and I wanted to share this stock with you

&#x200B;

What is IQ?

iQIYI Inc is an online entertainment service provider in China and it is known as the ""Netflix of China"". It is valued at around 10 billion dollars currently. It is primarily engaged in providing a variety of services encompassing internet video, live broadcasting, online games, online literature, animations, e-commerce and social media platform. The company produces original video content and distributes appealing professionally-produced content, partner-generated content, and user-generated content. It also offers a diverse collection of internet video content that appeals to users from broad demographics. The company's revenue is generated from membership services and online advertising services. The company earns the majority of its revenue from China. The company is based in Beijing and is partly owned by Baidu, the ""Google of China"". It had its IPO in 2018 and is currently sitting at around $13.3 per share.

&#x200B;

How is IQ 2021 Q1 financial report?

Total revenues reached RMB8.0 billion (US$1.2 billion), representing a 4% increase from the same period in 2020 and beat the estimate of $1,180,000,000.

Membership services revenue was RMB4.3 billion (US$658.1 million), representing a 7% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the decline of our subscribing members from 118.9 million as of March 31, 2020, which was a high base due to the impact of Covid-19, to 105.3 million as of March 31, 2021. Our subscribing members grew 3.6 million quarter-on-quarter due to the strong content launch coupled with the holidays in the first quarter, during which people spent more time viewing content.

Online advertising services revenue was RMB1.9 billion (US$292.5 million), representing a 25% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the rebound of both brand-advertising budgets and the number of brand advertisers amid the macroeconomy recovery.

Content distribution revenue was RMB779.1 million (US$118.9 million), representing a 29% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by more content titles we distributed to other platforms during the quarter.

Other revenues were RMB961.0 million (US$146.7 million), representing a 10% increase from the same period in 2020, primarily due to the growth of certain business lines.

Cost of revenues was RMB7.1 billion (US$1.1 billion), representing a 10% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to less content costs and bandwidth cost during the quarter. Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB5.4 billion (US$829.6 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to decline of licensed content cost.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB1.2 billion (US$183.3 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. This was primarily attribute to less provision for credit losses, which was a result of improved macroeconomic environment versus the same period last year.

Research and development expenses were RMB672.3 million (US$102.6 million), representing a 1% decrease from the same period in 2020.

Operating loss was RMB1.0 billion (US$154.8 million), compared to operating loss of RMB2.2 billion in the same period in 2020. Operating loss margin was 13%, compared to operating loss margin of 29% in the same period in 2020.

Total other expense was RMB222.4 million (US$34.0 million), compared to total other expense of RMB628.5 million during the same period of 2020. The year-over-year variance was mainly due to less foreign exchange loss.

Loss before income taxes was RMB1.2 billion (US$188.7 million), compared to loss before income taxes of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020.

Income tax expense was RMB20.6 million (US$3.1 million), compared to income tax expense of RMB4.8 million in the same period in 2020.

Net loss attributable to iQIYI was RMB1.3 billion (US$193.4 million), compared to net loss attributable to iQIYI of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020. Diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS was RMB1.61 (US$0.25) for the first quarter of 2021, compared to diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS of RMB3.92 in the same period of 2020.

As of March 31, 2021, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB13.3 billion (US$2.0 billion).

&#x200B;

Financial Guidance

For the second quarter of 2021, iQIYI expects total net revenues to be between RMB7.21 billion (US$1.10 billion) and RMB7.65 billion (US$1.17 billion), representing a 3% decrease to a 3% increase year over year. This forecast reflects iQIYI's current and preliminary view, which may be subject to change.

Price Target

If we use Netflix valuation as a benchmark. We can estimate the fair market value of IQ being at least equivalent to NFLX at 216B ($480/share). However, I personally think IQ should garner less since it main business is in China while Netflix is in America, Canada, Europe, you name it. Also, the subscription member of Netflix is about 207 million while IQ has only half of it, which is 105 million. Also, the member revenues of Netflix is about 24.7 billion, while that of IQ is only 4.3 billion. IQ has only about 18% of revenues of Netflix and so give IQ an $86/share target price. But my price target for the entire company is at least $200/share as it has half of the membership service of Netflix and it is still growing for IQ. Also, there is a large room of growth for IQ as it mainly focus on mainland nowadays but it will sure expand its business overseas",nfbmkd,[],0
3477,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"This pure focus on wholesale means UWMC does not spend as much cost on the servicing and advertising necessary to sustain a large retail business like for RKT. Overall, UWMC actually has had consistently higher net income margin than RKT, currently sitting at 68% vs. 58% for RKT.

UWMC's focus on wholesaling and working entirely with brokers makes it much easier for it to pivot to home purchase originations, which Freddie Mac actually predicts will grow 16% by 2022. Home purchases are more complex than refinances and the value of using a broker shines in those cases. In fact, UWMC is already more heavy on home purchases than its competitors. In the most recent quarter, 25% of its volume came from home purchases. Furthermore, a rise in interest rates may actually benefit UWMC in that the value of the loans they generate will be higher due to the higher cash flows.",nfbwv5,[],0

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a **fantastic setup**.

[AMC TA](https://preview.redd.it/gju8synduwz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=46c863adbb144c04e3327bb212a79bb1633608fc)

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

Edit: Only thing I forgot to mention was the upper trendline of the wedge extends back to that 17.25 high - this is just another data point that adds to the validity of the breakout.",nfg8mj,"['GME', 'AMC']",1
3481,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"[Here](https://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/isa-furthers-its-partnership-with-beyond-meat-with-the-certification-of-the-new-iteration-of-the-beyond-burger) is one of the many articles stating that as of today BYND burgers are now HALAL certified.   


If you don't know what Halal is or why this is relevant then you are probably not Muslim or Hindu. The certification will now give BYND a huge customer base boost in my opinion. Impossible Burgers did this in 2018 so the alternative meat market in the UAE has already been introduced. I think BYND is set to capitalize on this new certification especially as meat markets are already negatively impacted from COVID issues.   


$BYND also is sitting >20% short float so any upward movement in this stock could potentially start a quick move up. The stock is sitting near $100 and to me looks to be at a nice floor psychologically ($100 is a nice round bottom for people to buy near).   


Finally the OATLY IPO is coming quick. The alternative meat / protein space will likely be the talk of the town at near the end of the week which may bring BYND up or down with it as the IPO happens. The good ole sympathy trade...   


Disclosure: No I'm not muslim / hindu but I do have family that is. This certification gives them ""confidence"" that during the holidays they can still eat this food. It also allows them to serve this food at events, which is something I know has been an issue in the past for us personally. If it's not Halal it won't be served at a party / event.",nfh8o2,[],1

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit’s Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‘buy’ recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

It is an accessible and liquid way to trade the price of corn. Corn the US crop that has had its highs and lows over a long history but continues to have massive demand worldwide for a variety of uses and it is not slowing. Instead, weather risks, drought risks, execution risks, and other supply chain bottlenecks have impacts on the prices in the short and mid term and sometimes the long term. 
BEFORE you make any investment decision in Corn, let’s run through these important things:
1. WHO grows corn?
The 2 leading producers of corn include the US at 1 and China at 2 that is over 50% of total production. 
2. WHO consumes Corn?
Well… it’s The US and China accounting for over 50% of total consumption 
3.WHO is the top exporter?

4.WHO is top importer?

5. Risks?
As with every investment there is always downside risk! The downside risk here could be from many different factors, however, these are less likely and at current corn prices already priced in. 
These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil. 
-The absence of supply chain disruptions which, let’s face it, is not the theme so far in 2021.

The only way to stop these types of organized and unwarranted short attacks is to punish the perpetrators financially, again and again. Then, and only then, will you have a free and fair market for all.

$GME is the perfect example of how individual investors discussing the value of a company and deciding they like the stock enough to buy shares and options, can have a profound and unintended effect.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that’s why I’m not Dr. Burry. I’m sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I’m posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation.

If you read those footnotes, you can see that some judges on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (which is 7 very qualified federal judges) have recused themselves and others have had to renounce their claims (normal for judges) against the defendants to even participate, as they would have been members of the several putative actions. Meaning: one or more judges just on this small panel were holding meme stock at the time, if not currently.",nf7s3u,[],0

1.**The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets—i.e., much more dollar printing.**

**Let me dig in !**

The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion.

NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over “confidence” index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *“actually”* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *“demand”* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***“pulled forward”***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***“costs”*** **of** ***“long-term employment”*** **for a** ***“short-term”*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.** Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bcfon349vz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b498f76db582407f08e593e10dc5692e6005f2

 

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

&#x200B;

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it’ll be worse than expected:**

We finally got “official” confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It’s not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don’t hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time—i.e., the CPI is likely going even higher. 

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a “return to work bonus” in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one’s wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact. Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. For Silver q2 /2021 my targets are 42 Usd /ozz while gold 1.900 Usd/ozz .

GOOD JOB! TAX THE SHORTS! 

The 7.50c line held strong and the stock kept the Friday gains and pushed a bit more.

UWMC is obviously picking up some steam here on Reddit with spillover into many other stock-related platforms (yahoo, twits, alpha, etc). That chatter will certainly help continue the push.

Up some change in Pre-market for what it's worth but should only get better throughout the day.

This is a powder keg ready to go as soon as the 9c's go in the money. If we can exercise at 7.50 and 9 (EXERCISE FRIDAY 5/21 IF YOU CAN FRONT THE Cash!!!).

I suggest exercising even if you are 0.01$ ITM.

The Volume 05/17 was impressive at 17M (8M average) so there is certainly upwards pressure due to buying volume.

Another 2 days like yesterday and those 9c start printing, then it is really off the races and not messing with 8,10% and instead watching a serious gap UP.

Hopes some powder was saved for the push to 9c . I will be buying a few more shares today once some other options are sold for liquidity.

Position:I am loaded up on 6/18 8c and LEAPS. I still really like UWMC long-term but this short-term profit potential is simply staggering.

UWMC looks really good for breaking 9 by Thursday, we already have the 7.50c's ready to print from the push last week, then it's TO THE MOON as those options are exercised. 9c needs to hit this week to hit 12-14 (minimum) next week.

8605,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"Disclaimer and Risks: This is not a financial advice. Be cautious to bet against Winnie the Pooh🐻. One major risk factor is the fact that BIDU owns 53.08% of IQ, and even more worrisome is that about 30% of BIDU’s revenue in 2021 stems from IQ. Whether or not China will intervene to prevent the plunge in value of its own version of Google is unknown, but is certainly a risk that should be hedged against. I’m very confident on this trade and have verified some of the more important arguments lined in the paper, but as always do your own DD and hedge appropriately.

&#x200B;

Hi everyone, I’m here with another DD, but this time it’ll be a little different than my usual options-exclusive DD. Today, IQ has just released its 2021 Q1 result. I’ve seen a couple posts on iQIYI two years before and it seems to be the time to short squeeze it again. It has reached its historical low at servals data before, but it soon rebound for 5% after the financial statement is released. However, me and my team did a deep dive into IQ and I wanted to share this stock with you

&#x200B;

What is IQ?

iQIYI Inc is an online entertainment service provider in China and it is known as the ""Netflix of China"". It is valued at around 10 billion dollars currently. It is primarily engaged in providing a variety of services encompassing internet video, live broadcasting, online games, online literature, animations, e-commerce and social media platform. The company produces original video content and distributes appealing professionally-produced content, partner-generated content, and user-generated content. It also offers a diverse collection of internet video content that appeals to users from broad demographics. The company's revenue is generated from membership services and online advertising services. The company earns the majority of its revenue from China. The company is based in Beijing and is partly owned by Baidu, the ""Google of China"". It had its IPO in 2018 and is currently sitting at around $13.3 per share.

&#x200B;

How is IQ 2021 Q1 financial report?

Total revenues reached RMB8.0 billion (US$1.2 billion), representing a 4% increase from the same period in 2020 and beat the estimate of $1,180,000,000.

Membership services revenue was RMB4.3 billion (US$658.1 million), representing a 7% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the decline of our subscribing members from 118.9 million as of March 31, 2020, which was a high base due to the impact of Covid-19, to 105.3 million as of March 31, 2021. Our subscribing members grew 3.6 million quarter-on-quarter due to the strong content launch coupled with the holidays in the first quarter, during which people spent more time viewing content.

Online advertising services revenue was RMB1.9 billion (US$292.5 million), representing a 25% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the rebound of both brand-advertising budgets and the number of brand advertisers amid the macroeconomy recovery.

Content distribution revenue was RMB779.1 million (US$118.9 million), representing a 29% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by more content titles we distributed to other platforms during the quarter.

Other revenues were RMB961.0 million (US$146.7 million), representing a 10% increase from the same period in 2020, primarily due to the growth of certain business lines.

Cost of revenues was RMB7.1 billion (US$1.1 billion), representing a 10% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to less content costs and bandwidth cost during the quarter. Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB5.4 billion (US$829.6 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to decline of licensed content cost.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB1.2 billion (US$183.3 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. This was primarily attribute to less provision for credit losses, which was a result of improved macroeconomic environment versus the same period last year.

Research and development expenses were RMB672.3 million (US$102.6 million), representing a 1% decrease from the same period in 2020.

Operating loss was RMB1.0 billion (US$154.8 million), compared to operating loss of RMB2.2 billion in the same period in 2020. Operating loss margin was 13%, compared to operating loss margin of 29% in the same period in 2020.

Total other expense was RMB222.4 million (US$34.0 million), compared to total other expense of RMB628.5 million during the same period of 2020. The year-over-year variance was mainly due to less foreign exchange loss.

Loss before income taxes was RMB1.2 billion (US$188.7 million), compared to loss before income taxes of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020.

Income tax expense was RMB20.6 million (US$3.1 million), compared to income tax expense of RMB4.8 million in the same period in 2020.

Net loss attributable to iQIYI was RMB1.3 billion (US$193.4 million), compared to net loss attributable to iQIYI of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020. Diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS was RMB1.61 (US$0.25) for the first quarter of 2021, compared to diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS of RMB3.92 in the same period of 2020.

As of March 31, 2021, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB13.3 billion (US$2.0 billion).

&#x200B;

Financial Guidance

For the second quarter of 2021, iQIYI expects total net revenues to be between RMB7.21 billion (US$1.10 billion) and RMB7.65 billion (US$1.17 billion), representing a 3% decrease to a 3% increase year over year. This forecast reflects iQIYI's current and preliminary view, which may be subject to change.

Price Target

If we use Netflix valuation as a benchmark. We can estimate the fair market value of IQ being at least equivalent to NFLX at 216B ($480/share). However, I personally think IQ should garner less since it main business is in China while Netflix is in America, Canada, Europe, you name it. Also, the subscription member of Netflix is about 207 million while IQ has only half of it, which is 105 million. Also, the member revenues of Netflix is about 24.7 billion, while that of IQ is only 4.3 billion. IQ has only about 18% of revenues of Netflix and so give IQ an $86/share target price. But my price target for the entire company is at least $200/share as it has half of the membership service of Netflix and it is still growing for IQ. Also, there is a large room of growth for IQ as it mainly focus on mainland nowadays but it will sure expand its business overseas",nfbmkd,[],0
8606,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"This pure focus on wholesale means UWMC does not spend as much cost on the servicing and advertising necessary to sustain a large retail business like for RKT. Overall, UWMC actually has had consistently higher net income margin than RKT, currently sitting at 68% vs. 58% for RKT.

UWMC's focus on wholesaling and working entirely with brokers makes it much easier for it to pivot to home purchase originations, which Freddie Mac actually predicts will grow 16% by 2022. Home purchases are more complex than refinances and the value of using a broker shines in those cases. In fact, UWMC is already more heavy on home purchases than its competitors. In the most recent quarter, 25% of its volume came from home purchases. Furthermore, a rise in interest rates may actually benefit UWMC in that the value of the loans they generate will be higher due to the higher cash flows.",nfbwv5,[],0

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

If you don't know what Halal is or why this is relevant then you are probably not Muslim or Hindu. The certification will now give BYND a huge customer base boost in my opinion. Impossible Burgers did this in 2018 so the alternative meat market in the UAE has already been introduced. I think BYND is set to capitalize on this new certification especially as meat markets are already negatively impacted from COVID issues.   


$BYND also is sitting >20% short float so any upward movement in this stock could potentially start a quick move up. The stock is sitting near $100 and to me looks to be at a nice floor psychologically ($100 is a nice round bottom for people to buy near).   


Finally the OATLY IPO is coming quick. The alternative meat / protein space will likely be the talk of the town at near the end of the week which may bring BYND up or down with it as the IPO happens. The good ole sympathy trade...   


Disclosure: No I'm not muslim / hindu but I do have family that is. This certification gives them ""confidence"" that during the holidays they can still eat this food. It also allows them to serve this food at events, which is something I know has been an issue in the past for us personally. If it's not Halal it won't be served at a party / event.",nfh8o2,[],1

8623,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"I'm copying the abstract of the paper (Bradley et al. 2021 WP) -- don't blame me on that.

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit’s Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‘buy’ recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

BEFORE you make any investment decision in Corn, let’s run through these important things:
1. WHO grows corn?
The 2 leading producers of corn include the US at 1 and China at 2 that is over 50% of total production. 
2. WHO consumes Corn?
Well… it’s The US and China accounting for over 50% of total consumption

5. Risks?
As with every investment there is always downside risk! The downside risk here could be from many different factors, however, these are less likely and at current corn prices already priced in. 
These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil. 
-The absence of supply chain disruptions which, let’s face it, is not the theme so far in 2021.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

8649,2021-05-19,wallstreetbets,"Gold is for the most part useless. Similar to other nameless 'inflation hedges' that provide almost 0 current real world value. Might as well be beanie babies. However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease.

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it’s a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle’s tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle’s opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be a insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

I hope, you’re happy now, u/memetron9000!

Now to some of you it may not be a big deal but the public may feel different about that. You see, these reports we’ve seen that the government has been releasing “confirming” is just the tip of the iceberg. Now you may not believe aliens are real and that’s fine that you’re that ignorant. We don’t judge. However, the US has been conducting recon missions observing these aerial phenomenons. They know they exist. They know they are here. They do not know their intentions or capabilities. Which is scary to think. 

So how does this relate to stonks? How do you deal with a possible threat that has way better technology than you? You build and invest in better aerospace defensive technology. “Space Defense stocks” more or so space stocks “Trimble, Boeing, Lockheed, or even ETF stocks like ARKX” and others i can’t name off the top of my head.

His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that’s why I’m not Dr. Burry. I’m sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I’m posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I’m missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn’t detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I’m thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT. The fed claims this inflation is transitory, but I don’t think anyone on the street buys it. I think rates have to come up at least a little bit sometime between now and next January.

If there’s anything else I should be considering for this trade please comment, I’m interested in hearing other opinions on this.

1.**The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets—i.e., much more dollar printing.**

**Let me dig in !**

The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion.

NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over “confidence” index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *“actually”* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *“demand”* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***“pulled forward”***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***“costs”*** **of** ***“long-term employment”*** **for a** ***“short-term”*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.** Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bcfon349vz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b498f76db582407f08e593e10dc5692e6005f2

 

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w1cuikh69vz61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b01f66a5badd3fc80e79abecd97096e309324a5

 

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it’ll be worse than expected:**

We finally got “official” confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It’s not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don’t hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time—i.e., the CPI is likely going even higher. 

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a “return to work bonus” in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one’s wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

GOOD JOB! TAX THE SHORTS! 

The 7.50c line held strong and the stock kept the Friday gains and pushed a bit more.

UWMC is obviously picking up some steam here on Reddit with spillover into many other stock-related platforms (yahoo, twits, alpha, etc). That chatter will certainly help continue the push.

Up some change in Pre-market for what it's worth but should only get better throughout the day.

This is a powder keg ready to go as soon as the 9c's go in the money. If we can exercise at 7.50 and 9 (EXERCISE FRIDAY 5/21 IF YOU CAN FRONT THE Cash!!!).

I suggest exercising even if you are 0.01$ ITM.

The Volume 05/17 was impressive at 17M (8M average) so there is certainly upwards pressure due to buying volume.

Another 2 days like yesterday and those 9c start printing, then it is really off the races and not messing with 8,10% and instead watching a serious gap UP.

Hopes some powder was saved for the push to 9c . I will be buying a few more shares today once some other options are sold for liquidity.

Position:I am loaded up on 6/18 8c and LEAPS. I still really like UWMC long-term but this short-term profit potential is simply staggering.

UWMC looks really good for breaking 9 by Thursday, we already have the 7.50c's ready to print from the push last week, then it's TO THE MOON as those options are exercised. 9c needs to hit this week to hit 12-14 (minimum) next week.

8961,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"Disclaimer and Risks: This is not a financial advice. Be cautious to bet against Winnie the Pooh🐻. One major risk factor is the fact that BIDU owns 53.08% of IQ, and even more worrisome is that about 30% of BIDU’s revenue in 2021 stems from IQ. Whether or not China will intervene to prevent the plunge in value of its own version of Google is unknown, but is certainly a risk that should be hedged against. I’m very confident on this trade and have verified some of the more important arguments lined in the paper, but as always do your own DD and hedge appropriately.

&#x200B;

Hi everyone, I’m here with another DD, but this time it’ll be a little different than my usual options-exclusive DD. Today, IQ has just released its 2021 Q1 result. I’ve seen a couple posts on iQIYI two years before and it seems to be the time to short squeeze it again. It has reached its historical low at servals data before, but it soon rebound for 5% after the financial statement is released. However, me and my team did a deep dive into IQ and I wanted to share this stock with you

&#x200B;

What is IQ?

iQIYI Inc is an online entertainment service provider in China and it is known as the ""Netflix of China"". It is valued at around 10 billion dollars currently. It is primarily engaged in providing a variety of services encompassing internet video, live broadcasting, online games, online literature, animations, e-commerce and social media platform. The company produces original video content and distributes appealing professionally-produced content, partner-generated content, and user-generated content. It also offers a diverse collection of internet video content that appeals to users from broad demographics. The company's revenue is generated from membership services and online advertising services. The company earns the majority of its revenue from China. The company is based in Beijing and is partly owned by Baidu, the ""Google of China"". It had its IPO in 2018 and is currently sitting at around $13.3 per share.

&#x200B;

How is IQ 2021 Q1 financial report?

Total revenues reached RMB8.0 billion (US$1.2 billion), representing a 4% increase from the same period in 2020 and beat the estimate of $1,180,000,000.

Membership services revenue was RMB4.3 billion (US$658.1 million), representing a 7% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the decline of our subscribing members from 118.9 million as of March 31, 2020, which was a high base due to the impact of Covid-19, to 105.3 million as of March 31, 2021. Our subscribing members grew 3.6 million quarter-on-quarter due to the strong content launch coupled with the holidays in the first quarter, during which people spent more time viewing content.

Online advertising services revenue was RMB1.9 billion (US$292.5 million), representing a 25% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the rebound of both brand-advertising budgets and the number of brand advertisers amid the macroeconomy recovery.

Content distribution revenue was RMB779.1 million (US$118.9 million), representing a 29% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by more content titles we distributed to other platforms during the quarter.

Other revenues were RMB961.0 million (US$146.7 million), representing a 10% increase from the same period in 2020, primarily due to the growth of certain business lines.

Cost of revenues was RMB7.1 billion (US$1.1 billion), representing a 10% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to less content costs and bandwidth cost during the quarter. Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB5.4 billion (US$829.6 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to decline of licensed content cost.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB1.2 billion (US$183.3 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. This was primarily attribute to less provision for credit losses, which was a result of improved macroeconomic environment versus the same period last year.

Research and development expenses were RMB672.3 million (US$102.6 million), representing a 1% decrease from the same period in 2020.

Operating loss was RMB1.0 billion (US$154.8 million), compared to operating loss of RMB2.2 billion in the same period in 2020. Operating loss margin was 13%, compared to operating loss margin of 29% in the same period in 2020.

Total other expense was RMB222.4 million (US$34.0 million), compared to total other expense of RMB628.5 million during the same period of 2020. The year-over-year variance was mainly due to less foreign exchange loss.

Loss before income taxes was RMB1.2 billion (US$188.7 million), compared to loss before income taxes of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020.

Income tax expense was RMB20.6 million (US$3.1 million), compared to income tax expense of RMB4.8 million in the same period in 2020.

Net loss attributable to iQIYI was RMB1.3 billion (US$193.4 million), compared to net loss attributable to iQIYI of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020. Diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS was RMB1.61 (US$0.25) for the first quarter of 2021, compared to diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS of RMB3.92 in the same period of 2020.

As of March 31, 2021, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB13.3 billion (US$2.0 billion).

&#x200B;

Financial Guidance

For the second quarter of 2021, iQIYI expects total net revenues to be between RMB7.21 billion (US$1.10 billion) and RMB7.65 billion (US$1.17 billion), representing a 3% decrease to a 3% increase year over year. This forecast reflects iQIYI's current and preliminary view, which may be subject to change.

Price Target

If we use Netflix valuation as a benchmark. We can estimate the fair market value of IQ being at least equivalent to NFLX at 216B ($480/share). However, I personally think IQ should garner less since it main business is in China while Netflix is in America, Canada, Europe, you name it. Also, the subscription member of Netflix is about 207 million while IQ has only half of it, which is 105 million. Also, the member revenues of Netflix is about 24.7 billion, while that of IQ is only 4.3 billion. IQ has only about 18% of revenues of Netflix and so give IQ an $86/share target price. But my price target for the entire company is at least $200/share as it has half of the membership service of Netflix and it is still growing for IQ. Also, there is a large room of growth for IQ as it mainly focus on mainland nowadays but it will sure expand its business overseas",nfbmkd,[],0
8962,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"This pure focus on wholesale means UWMC does not spend as much cost on the servicing and advertising necessary to sustain a large retail business like for RKT. Overall, UWMC actually has had consistently higher net income margin than RKT, currently sitting at 68% vs. 58% for RKT.

UWMC's focus on wholesaling and working entirely with brokers makes it much easier for it to pivot to home purchase originations, which Freddie Mac actually predicts will grow 16% by 2022. Home purchases are more complex than refinances and the value of using a broker shines in those cases. In fact, UWMC is already more heavy on home purchases than its competitors. In the most recent quarter, 25% of its volume came from home purchases. Furthermore, a rise in interest rates may actually benefit UWMC in that the value of the loans they generate will be higher due to the higher cash flows.",nfbwv5,[],0
8965,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"A lot of people from my $GME post were curious about the technicals on $AMC - so I figured I would post them as well.

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a **fantastic setup**.

[AMC TA](https://preview.redd.it/gju8synduwz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=46c863adbb144c04e3327bb212a79bb1633608fc)

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

Not Financial Advice

Edit: Only thing I forgot to mention was the upper trendline of the wedge extends back to that 17.25 high - this is just another data point that adds to the validity of the breakout.",nfg8mj,"['GME', 'AMC']",1
8966,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"[Here](https://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/isa-furthers-its-partnership-with-beyond-meat-with-the-certification-of-the-new-iteration-of-the-beyond-burger) is one of the many articles stating that as of today BYND burgers are now HALAL certified.   


If you don't know what Halal is or why this is relevant then you are probably not Muslim or Hindu. The certification will now give BYND a huge customer base boost in my opinion. Impossible Burgers did this in 2018 so the alternative meat market in the UAE has already been introduced. I think BYND is set to capitalize on this new certification especially as meat markets are already negatively impacted from COVID issues.   


$BYND also is sitting >20% short float so any upward movement in this stock could potentially start a quick move up. The stock is sitting near $100 and to me looks to be at a nice floor psychologically ($100 is a nice round bottom for people to buy near).   


Finally the OATLY IPO is coming quick. The alternative meat / protein space will likely be the talk of the town at near the end of the week which may bring BYND up or down with it as the IPO happens. The good ole sympathy trade...   


Disclosure: No I'm not muslim / hindu but I do have family that is. This certification gives them ""confidence"" that during the holidays they can still eat this food. It also allows them to serve this food at events, which is something I know has been an issue in the past for us personally. If it's not Halal it won't be served at a party / event.",nfh8o2,[],1

8979,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,"I'm copying the abstract of the paper (Bradley et al. 2021 WP) -- don't blame me on that.

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit’s Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‘buy’ recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

I would like you all to understand, however, that buying call options on the Teucrium Corn fund that tracks a mix of Corn futures could lead to a profitable trade. It is an accessible and liquid way to trade the price of corn. Corn the US crop that has had its highs and lows over a long history but continues to have massive demand worldwide for a variety of uses and it is not slowing. Instead, weather risks, drought risks, execution risks, and other supply chain bottlenecks have impacts on the prices in the short and mid term and sometimes the long term. 
BEFORE you make any investment decision in Corn, let’s run through these important things:
1. WHO grows corn?
The 2 leading producers of corn include the US at 1 and China at 2 that is over 50% of total production. 
2. WHO consumes Corn?
Well… it’s The US and China accounting for over 50% of total consumption 
3.WHO is the top exporter?
The US is the top exporter
4.WHO is top importer?
China is the top importer by far (Mexico was for years until this year and commitments for next year)
5. Risks?
As with every investment there is always downside risk! The downside risk here could be from many different factors, however, these are less likely and at current corn prices already priced in. 
These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil. 
-The absence of supply chain disruptions which, let’s face it, is not the theme so far in 2021.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it’s a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle’s tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle’s opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be a insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

Now to some of you it may not be a big deal but the public may feel different about that. You see, these reports we’ve seen that the government has been releasing “confirming” is just the tip of the iceberg. Now you may not believe aliens are real and that’s fine that you’re that ignorant. We don’t judge. However, the US has been conducting recon missions observing these aerial phenomenons. They know they exist. They know they are here. They do not know their intentions or capabilities. Which is scary to think. 

So how does this relate to stonks? How do you deal with a possible threat that has way better technology than you? You build and invest in better aerospace defensive technology. “Space Defense stocks” more or so space stocks “Trimble, Boeing, Lockheed, or even ETF stocks like ARKX” and others i can’t name off the top of my head. The point is, the public will feel as if we are vulnerable and in doing so the country will pour billions into aerospace defense and technology.

Another note. There’s a name to one of the spaceships named “Tic Tac” which is known to travel at 35,000 mph and can travel through air and water. Google tic tac.",ng73bn,[],1

On your phone, turn off your wifi and try to log back in and it worked for me. You can then turn on wifi again and the app works normally. For some reason today, when wifi is turned on, the app won't let me log in.

They probably pushed some kind of bad update somewhere.",ng7dxm,[],0
