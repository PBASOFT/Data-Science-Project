They are also offering a special share purchase that they estimate at another $1 value. So you will get paid out, then issued a stock will list at about 5.50 on opening day. But, with the hot rental market and new debt structure, I believe the new reissued stock will soar. I do not believe that you will be able to buy the new company stock below $7 on opening day.

A 10 bagger is a stock that increases in value by at least 10 times its purchase price, or by at least 900%. It will take a few years for it to get to that level which is why this is my long term investment! A few things I will point out is 1. California 2. Their Business Model 3. Plenty of room for growth 4. The land acquisition because businesses can be built off of various Competitive Advantages and Brand messages, but without a winning Distribution strategy, there is no business! 

The following comes from a press release We are setting the stage to improve margins while expanding end-market access, and to grow, refine, produce, distribute, sell, and home-deliver top cannabis products in the largest and fastest growing cannabis market on the planet.

30,gz10vrx,2021-05-22,t1_gz0r5tb,pennystocks,"I was in a similar situation. I sold some at a loss and then added a little more money to my account. Note, this is my play account so we're not taking serious money. I was then able to average down a few other stocks and get out with some gains in some cases.  From there I have made better choices and picked better entry points. I'm still down about 18% overall but my portfolio is in much better shape and I have some winners I am holding. I think I'll be whole again by summer. 

I sold positions that freed up the most cash which gave me the ability to average down on smaller positions and get out whole on some of those or very close on others. 

My biggest change in my investing strategy was watching my entry points. DD is hit and miss and there are so many PnD stocks. I started focusing on getting stocks that have previously traded higher but for one reason or another are near 52 week lows or at low positions that historically have represented stops.  So far so good for me but again, my penny stock account is the same as sitting at the blackjack table. Strictly for fun. This is not financial advise. Good luck",[],0

134,gz1vq8o,2021-05-22,t1_gz1slck,pennystocks,"So you think if they found several billion dollars of oil and sign JV partnerships to extract BUT the SEC throws everyone in the board in jail the SP would fall?   One's shares represent  the discounted price of future revenue.  So how would that be affected by folk's going to jail?  Now short term SP may/ will be affected but for the long term investor the ONLY thing that is going to affect it up or down is the oil itself.

When BP had their oil spill in Gulf or Toyota airbags killed a whole bunch of folks in the end it didn't matter because each share's value ONLY matter if they stop selling oil or cars respective.  

This the EXACT reason I love these catalyst plays.  As an investor it is easy to know when to stay in or out of the play.  It ALL matters on them doing when their job is, i.e. to find/ pull oil out of the ground.  That's it.  That is why I posted this for folks who wanted to timelines of each upcoming catalyst on that quest.  If they fail at that  yes the SP will drop (as it should).",[],0

For now, I don't really know what to think about the financing debt of 60 millions of Road Runner. They seems to be confident in their business model to get such a financing and they have partnership, but this is OTC and they already have a large cap (70 millions). My guess is that the stock will rise back to .05 cents at some point because of GS hype, and that it will tank when they'll release the name of the merge. To me, the company operate in a non-sexy field, so I think the hype will vanish real quick. 

To me, the only way that it could be hyped up, it is if they announced the merge + a publicity partnership with big corporation (they can do road publicity with that kind of technology so that could be an opportunity).

170,gz2171z,2021-05-22,t1_gz0r5tb,pennystocks,"If you're in the US, before anything else, go to OTCMarkets.com, and enter each one of your stocks into the search bar (one at a time). Each stock's page will say on the upper right corner what its status is: Pink, Pink/Limited Info, Pink/No Info. If it says Pink/No Information, and has a little picture of a stop sign, you're most likely going to need to sell those stocks before September, otherwise you won't be able to sell them at all.

Some of the No Info stocks are working on getting current, so you don't need to panic with them. I was able to find some of that by searching the ticker on Twitter. The ones that are not doing anything to get current need to go. As far as we've seen, no broker is going to allow you to buy OR sell these stocks, so you'll be stuck with them.

Once you've figured out which stocks need to go, you can work on the other suggestions you've gotten here. Averaging down to minimize loss has been my main move. Look at the total price you spent for each stock, and decide how much of a loss you can deal with. You may have spent so little on some that it's not worth the effort to try to average down.

I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s worth it to have both higher risk/reward plays and some lower on the risk/reward scale.

So this one has a potential to be a 5-10X bagger but you know there’s less risk of losing 20-30% on any given day. Growth potential is limited, but it’ll likely take less time to achieve that growth than that sure 50-100X bagger.

I like to buy and sell in 1/3 increments, a lesson I learned the hard way. A common exception would be if, say, I catch a ticker right as news dropped and it’s taking off. For those day trades, you want to have an entry and exit plan, and just stick with it, quick in and out. Too easy to get stuck with bags, and you’ll rarely time the top or bottom perfectly, no sense in risking your gains. 

It’s easy to get greedy, and I’m sure you’ve heard to not trade on emotions—emotional trading is by far the biggest culprit. Having a plan, a typical trading style you adhere to, and setting your risk tolerance and profit targets help to remain consistent, and is the best way to eliminate that as much as possible. Things will differ depending on the stock/company (also note that often times, the stock ≠ the company) and what kind of play it is, but these are generally things to keep in mind. Periodically reassess your plays and see if your plan is still on track, or adjust if fundamentals have changed. And one more time for good measure: consistency is key!",[],0

I read the first sentence and realized you have no idea what you're talking about. Sharp has applied for custodianship of dozens of companies and the only case he actually won was by default because the company did not represent itself. He's literally 0 for 30.

If you wanna track his progress, there was a court meeting on Friday about his custodianship of RETC. There was no resolution and will continue session on Monday at 330pm EST. I have no doubt that RETC is shady af considering the woman they chose to represent them doesn't even know who the chairmen are, but I can assure you if Sharp does win this, it has NOTHING to do with him having a ""good track record"".

As far as GVSI. I'm not a buyer until I see some progress, they haven't filed a report in 5 years.

As far as things to watch monday, I've got a shortlist:

$MDCN - Nothing for 6 years. Filed everything they need to go current this weekend.

$GLDFF - New acquisition yesterday, name change (and ticker change) on Tuesday.

$PALAF - Filed 27 reports this weekend, one of them stating there was no uranium leak.

$EEGI / $RLBD / $EEGI / $MJWL - ""Hot"" stocks at the moment.

**Subsidiaries**

\- Etelix: VoIP in Latam, Africa and Asia. Super important. Underdeveloped countries have high demand for VoIP (telephones communicating over TCP/IP instead of copper cables, high quality sound). 4G and 5G connectivity. THIS IS WHERE THE BIG MONEY WILL BE. Etelix will be a huge driver for the company. And if Etelix succeed with infrastructure, all their other subsidiaries within telecom witll benefit from newly developed and acquired technologies.

\- SwissLink: VoIP in Europe. Mehh. Not interesting but a stable and slowly growing source of revenue.

\- QGlobal SMS: SMS-messaging focused in USA (not interesting but stable source of income) and south America (very interesting, poor existing telecom solutions).

\- SMSDirectos: Colombian Marketing Service, potential for high YoY growth. Especially when Colombias economy starts growing post COVID

\- IoTLabs: Tricky to predict. If they succeed with somewhat disruptive products and services, they will se a HUGE YoY growth and could be a company driver as well.

\- Global Money One: Financial technology focused, aiming to disrupt the Fin market with better and faster payment solutions and secure international money transfers. Also, a successful vertical integration with their blockchain technology could make their revenue rocket like mad dogs.

&#x200B;

This company has EVERYTHING they need to succeed. EPS, YoY growth and net profit will rip a hole in the fabric of space in 2023.

If you buy now, I believe you will tripple your money EoY. Then continue to earn in 2022, and cry of joy in 2023.

This is a LONG TERM investment. Buy as much stock as you can afford now, and then forget the company. Dont check your portfolio or read news about them. Just forget them and check your account again on new years eve for a lovely surprise.

One thing is almost certain though. If you buy now, you wil buy the deepest dip we will ever see. If I'm wrong about this, I will get in a fighting ring with a real bear!

I believe Sharp should win this case (the CEO won't even show up in person or on Zoom to save his own company). If he wins, I will wait for the stock to shoot up and then sell. 

I have over 5 million shares in $MDCN and have been holding it for months. So nice to finally seem them making strides to go current. No way this company should be at this price level with close to $40 million in assets.  I plan on holding this gem for the foreseeable future.",[],1
