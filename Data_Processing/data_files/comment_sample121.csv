I don't think you know what crypto means. I've used cryptography years before blockchain even existed. Seems like you don't know what use case means either.

A currency that is stable in value, not inflationary, and anonymous, something like monero perhaps, does have some limited use case.  It can be useful to buy drugs and other illegal substances for example. An inherently inflationary currency however is useless and not a currency at all.

12,gz6olbn,2021-05-23,t3_niwj6i,StockMarket,"There's nothing wrong with having some crypto exposure in your portfolio but it's a 100% gamble. Pure speculation at it's best. A lot of big and institutional money is involved but at very low rate relative.

Currently it's mostly seen as an inflation hedge and a lot of the recent sell off (besides China news) is possibly going into gold or other commodities for the same reason.

Also they're whales in every coin that can manipulate the price if they choose.

But literally no one knows where it's headed. BTC could go sub 10k tomorrow or over 100k. Even WSB bans crypto talk on their sub and they love to gamble. That should tell you something.

It's fun to play with and a way to learn technicals but all the timelines are sped up and again crazy volatile so it might just do whatever it wants.

If you sell, you should be able to write off the losses over a couple years. Talk to your accountant about that. If you make over 100k and have no expenses use an accountant. Don't fuck with H&R block or do them yourself. You'll save whatever it costs you and it should only be a few hundred bucks to use an CPA. You should probably be investing more of your money for tax reasons. It's shitty but straight up saving is not the fastest way to accumulate wealth or best use of your money. There's tons of ways to work your money and invest it. 

Also talk to a mortgage broker about an FHA loan. If it's your first home you should be able to put 3.5% down. Interest rates are so low that you might be better off using a small down payment and paying off the principle when it's financially convenient. Remember a phone call is always free.

And if you're going to be an active investor, it's time consuming. You'll spend a lot of your day thinking about money, politics and economics. Do it, get your net worth up bc it gives you freedom.

for me it's also the same a bit for the stockmarket, but not as bad. As an investor, it's incredibly dumb investing in something because someone said so.   
Everbody can buy it, the hard part is selling it. I think for example coinbase will gain value over the years, but if I tell you that, as someone who doesn't use or understand crypto exchanges and what makes them different from other exchanges, you will not know when to sell. It might be coinbase, it might even be apple or ford. If the stock market is a gamble, I believe one should at least do some qualified guessing, if you don't understand why and how they make money, you shouldn't invest. For example, did you know that McDonalds isn't really a fast-food chain? they are more like realtors, so if individual stores doesn't sell enough burgers, that doesn't do as much on the price of the company. Investing in McDonalds without knowing how and when they make money is stupid.

No need to print and retain paper receipts either. BTC is still in its nascent stage and no doubt has its problems, but it is laying the groundwork as a settlement protocol.

So a double drawdown to 40 and 30 was sort of expected. I actually expected it to pull down to 25 and bounce back as sharp as it did from 30.


Where would I say this is a negated pattern: difficult to tell, since the numbers are so big it will offer a fairly large margin of error, which is of course unsatisfactory.

So if consider the start of the latest impulse wave not at the bottom of the pandemic drop, but rather at the sideways move a year ago, I would say baseline is around 9000-9500. And the full wave in 535 was up to 42k, with the 5 move to 1.618 to 62k was the overextension with rsi and Macd divergence. Then the full retracement would be to the .618 level which is 29k.

*However* also the .5 level is possible which is 25kish.

Let me preface this by saying I've read (line-by-line) the full source code of bitcoind (the official implementation), and most of an earlier version of lnd (a Go implementation of the Bitcoin Lightning Network). So I understand the technology

Bitcoin's blockchain keeps track of unspent transaction outputs, in other words the ""balance"" of accounts. An account is a set of private cryptographic keys. Bitcoin is a method of transferring coin ownership from one account to another, in public. Doing these transfers is trivial if you have a private database

Bitcoin's blockchain is simply a method of maintaining a public database. The alternative is a private database on bank computers. But you have to trust the banks and the government

To understand Bitcoin intuitively, watch a real-time animated visualization of the global Bitcoin transaction flow, as it is happening right now. This shows how Bitcoin is being used, right now, in real-time:

https://dailyblockchain.github.io/

Each square is a bitcoin address (similar to a cryptographic public key)

Each graph component is a transaction. The components appear as transactions are broadcast into the bitcoin P2P network (but before they are verified and committed to the blockchain)

Each transaction simply transfers bitcoin: from one or more input addresses, to one or more output addresses. In other words, money flows from one or more previous owners, to one or more new owners. That's how a currency works

Coin ownership flows from green to red (yellow is in/out: I pay you and take some change back at the same address)

When the output of one transaction becomes an input for a new transaction, the components are pulled together

For comparison, Visa handles about 1700 transactions per second. Bitcoin transactions are very expensive (mining fees) and very slow due to intrinsic limitations of the technology (broadcast P2P blockchain consensus). The only benefit is that there's no trusted central authority and a deterministic supply of bitcoins (controlled inflation)

Here are the current transaction fees. This is how much you pay a miner to include your transaction in a block. It is very expensive if you want fast inclusion, and very slow if you don't want to pay:

During small corrections, negative beta might help you out.  If it ends up being a big correction, that negative beta is unlikely to hold.

GME has not historically been a negative beta stock. It's only recent events.

Remember that ""Past performance is no guarantee of future results"".

If you invest in gme you're believing in the ability of a populist movement to outmaneuver the financial system, and that's totally ok. But there is no guarrantee that it succeeds, and if it does succeed it could cause a real mess.

Personally I'm not touching it. Not betting for or against. Either way is a high risk bet and I'm happy to take my slow but stable gains over risking on this big bet where anything could happen",['GME'],0

I listened to an Odd Lots podcast where the CEO of a large shipping logistics provider said that he expects a bull whip effect as current shortages are being over compensated for with huge orders. Once those shipments arrive, prices could over correct.
