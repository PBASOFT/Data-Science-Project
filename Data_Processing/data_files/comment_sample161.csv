22,gzavp3b,2021-05-24,t3_nk4fr6,pennystocks,"OTC stocks often aren't very liquid, and don't have market makers.  That means it's quite common for there to be a big spread between bids and asks.  The last sale price doesn't dictate what you can sell at, ultimately you can only sell for what someone is willing to buy at (not necessarily as high as the last trade.)  I don't know the details behind GSVI, but it's caveat emptor on OTC Markets and I can't even see bids or asks through my broker.  Clearly not many people are able to trade it; your position is 6x the average daily trading volume!  This is why it's key to both buy and sell with limit orders.

As the sole compensation for the Extended Term, Mr. Dargan was issued an option (“Option”) to purchase 25,000 shares of the Company’s common stock for each month during the Extended Term (thus, an option to purchase 300,000 shares reflecting an extended term of 12 months). The Option vests over the period of the Extended Term, with 25,000 shares having vested as of March 15, 2021, and the remaining shares to vest 25,000 shares monthly beginning March 31, 2021, and each month thereafter, so long as the agreement is in full force and effect. The Option is exercisable at $0.174 per share, the closing price of BioLargo’s common stock on the March 18, 2021 grant date, expires ten years from the grant date, and was issued pursuant to the Company’s 2018 Equity Incentive Plan.  
  
The Option is Mr. Dargan’s sole compensation for the Extended Term. As was the case in all prior terms of his engagement, there is no cash component of his compensation for the Extended Term. Mr. Dargan is eligible to be reimbursed for business expenses he incurs in connection with the performance of his services as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer (although he has made no such requests for reimbursement in the past). All other provisions of the Engagement Agreement not expressly amended pursuant to the Engagement Extension Agreement remain the same, including provisions regarding indemnification and arbitration of disputes.

This is the EXACT reason I only invest in stocks that have specific catalysts they are trying to reach.  This way I KNOW if I should stick with the play or not.  The current stock price is never a consideration.  It only matters if they are successful or not with the hitting the catalyst.  Here is an example using your stocks...

EEENF... yes has a specific catalyst (trying to find commercial oil) and has a pretty specific timeline (mid Dec. or so).  Folks keep saying Oct., but the ice road is not even built until Dec. so won't be before that.  So no reason to care about stock price until then because ultimate SP  will only be determined if they find oil or not they can pull out of the ground.

High Tide... No specific catalyst.  You are just hoping as the keep growing in stores and revenue they will eventually go up in SP. 

For me, it would be easy to invest in EEENF, but not HITIF.  I don't like investing in companies and just hoping for organic growth leading to increase in SP.  You never really know how long to stay on that ride when the SP may not go up for 6m, 5 years, never, etc...  The former is easy.  If it hits on redrilling in Dec. then you make $$$.  If it doesn't you lose $$$.  Very clear and defined.

93,gzb5zg7,2021-05-24,t1_gyl9j16,pennystocks,"Yes ! Ideanomics, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDEX) shareholders will have a reason to smile and laugh with tears, with analysts making substantial upgrades to this year's forecasts. Consensus estimates suggest investors could expect greatly increased statutory revenues and earnings per share, with the analyst modelling a real improvement in business performance. The market seems to be pricing in some improvement in the business too, with the stock up 9.7% over the past week. Could this big upgrade push the stock even higher?

  
Following the upgrade, the current consensus from analysts is for revenues of US$129m in 2021 which - if met - would reflect a substantial 119% increase on its sales over the past 12 months. The loss per share is anticipated to greatly reduce in the near future, narrowing 84% to US$0.05. However, before this estimates update, the consensus had been expecting revenues of US$105m and US$0.11 per share in losses. We can see there's definitely been a change in sentiment in this update, with the analyst administering a sizeable upgrade to this year's revenue estimates, while at the same time reducing their loss estimates.

  
Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. For example, we noticed that Ideanomics' rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with revenues forecast to exhibit 184% growth to the end of 2021 on an annualized basis. That is well above its historical decline of 2.6% a year over the past five years. Compare this against analyst estimates for the broader industry, which suggest that (in aggregate) industry revenues are expected to grow 13% annually, therefore Ideanomics will grow faster than its competitors.",[],0

I am a realist and in life all that matters to politicians are votes and $$$.  They own 10% of the Namibia producton+ significant royalties+ taxes.

BTW, if I planned on selling this is the WORST time to do it.  These environmental issues will not affect well 2 or the analysis of cores from well 1.  If I was going to sell I would have waited for the SP to explode up  on that news and then sell.  If these issues affect SP it will only be in  final expl.  It isn't like they are going to stop drilling well 2 or process the cores from well 1 due to any environmental stories on NG.  The only reason to sell now would be if you think the next set of results are going to be bad and thus drop SP.

I have actually held a small position all this time and am down something like 30% in it, lol. Definately a lot of downward pressure on pennies with the inflation fears, plus the dilution I discussed in the OP. Still, lately there has been some resurgence in some of these tech penny stocks and now may actually be a good time to get in for a short run. 

IWSY recently made a stock deal with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, but there are rewards built in if the stock reaches certain levels, so the company is obligated to continue building the share price. 

Their recent 10-Q shows a large decline in Software and royalties revenue, but also a smaller net loss overall than in the same quarter last year. The company has a lot of liabilities that I haven't had the patience to really untangle, so it's hard to tell if they are making much progress yet. 

They have an earnings call coming up on June 2. Could be enlightening to see what their plans are.

People seem to think choosing FIFO is good but in most cases it is one of the worst options for tax purposes.  The other comment here talks about lowering your cost basis but that is seriously misunderstood.  Just because you see your cost basis change doesn't mean you are making more money.  That is silly.  You are just paying more taxes in realized gains. 

The goal should be to minimize taxable income, NOT trying to keep your cost basis accurate or any other reason.  

Use tax lot optimizer if possible, otherwise sell the one(s) that get you the lowest ""Realized Gain"" which is usually the ones that cost you the most.  Also, if you are ever going to hold any for 1 year to get to long-term gains, always plan to sell the newer ones so you keep the oldest tac lots for longterm gains.


I hope this makes sense.",[],0

However, I do have a few companies that I am in long term and have made multiple purchases.  When I go to sell them I will select Tax Lot Optimizer.

1. Smart mirrors are not consumer products. it is a Business to Business product aimed at high end hotels and clothing companies. 

2. It's an incredibly niche field that competes with large established SaSS (software as a service) companies. A lot of times their sales are link to selling apps for employees to interact with mirrors (like customers requesting different clothing sizes from change rooms). I.E. the mirrors themselves are not enough to close sales.

First impressions are that their balance sheet looks sound. Their cash flow has been questionable for sure but with a sound balance sheet. Their liabilities are well covered by current assets alone and they were operating debt free it looks like until last year and since then they have already paid down roughly 25% of that since 2020. For me I will seriously consider this for a more speculative portion of my portfolio. The health of the company says to me that they are likely well managed and that they have time to develop and release more products. Another thing I like about this as a speculative play is the stable price basically since 2001. It could be a perpetual underperformer or it could just be an unnoticed gem that needs a good product and some good publicity.

The meeting is a catalyst, so the price will rise up until the meeting, but it is sort of arbitrary too... The true catalyst is the effective date of the merger (date of record for preferred stock). This should be before June 30th and dictates who gets the special dividend.

I'm expecting $3+ for June 11th and $4-5+ for the merger date, followed by a sell-off (20-25%?) after the merger due to the TRCH shareholders getting the dividend and MMATF shareholders getting 3x shares.

The education stocks that plummeted at the beginning of the market also fluctuated all the way down during the session, and the sector was all green as of the close of the market.  
Meten Education ( $METX) plunged 32.38%, and the market value of the three major education giants, New Oriental ($EDU), $TAL, and $Gotu, lost a total of US$8.9 billion, or about 57 billion yuan. Among them, New Oriental ($EDU) plummeted 18.29%, and its market value evaporated by $3.48 billion or about RMB22.3 billion. $TAL plummeted 17.14%, the market value evaporated $4.7 billion or about RMB30.4 billion.  
On the news, there are media reports that Beijing Haidian Education Commission is about to introduce a ""double reduction"" policy. A person familiar with the matter said that with the introduction of the new policy, off-campus training institutions will not be allowed to open classes during holidays, disciplinary and quality education and training institutions shall not be listed, education and training institutions are not allowed to make any advertisements.  
In addition, the 19th meeting of the Central Comprehensive Deepening Reform Committee held on the afternoon of May 21, reviewed and approved the ""Opinions on Further Reducing the Burden of Students' Work and Off-campus Training in Compulsory Education."" The meeting pointed out that it is necessary to fully standardize the management of off-campus training institutions, adhere to strict governance, and severely investigate and deal with institutions that have problems such as non-qualification, chaotic management, taking advantage of money, false propaganda, and collusion with schools for profit. It is necessary to clarify the charging standards of training institutions, strengthen the supervision of advance fees, and prohibit arbitrary capitalization operations.",[],0

Meantime, the value is in the patent portfolio and in the possibility of a buyout by one of the big pharmas prior to FDA approval.  There is also a ton of value in their treatments for sexual dysfunction in both men and women and for lower back pain, all of which are either actually commercialized or are in the process now. They could close significant licensing deals on these, in addition to their own organic sales growth now that the negative impact of COVID is essentially over.  They got whacked pretty bad by COVID right as they were ramping up sales activities. All of these factors will keep SP moving up between now and FDA approval of ImmCelz-based treatments for stroke, diabetes, liver failure, RA, and Parkinson's. There is a ton of upside here, but it will be volatile. Best not to invest anything you don't want to hold long term (probably a year), and be prepared to possibly see it go under your buy price at times while it develops.

It is sad that they do not provide more clarity about the horizons they expected to encounter vs what they did encounter. Best I can tell, the N14 sand (part of the Harrier prospect) is one of the bottom two sands that they did not get fluid samples. That speaks to the “Harrier Shallow” prospect. The other bottom sand that they did not get samples from is not covered by their resource estimate (as they said they did not expect it nor had it been mapped anywhere else. The flash results for the upper sand samples may indicate oil but also may not. These are likely the N20 and N18 sands in their diagram. We can only hope that they are representative.

I believe the 10 million is real, but what you fail to realize is 10 million in drilling is NOTHING.  Them paying in shares to contractors who need $$$ now to feed their families is a good indication they are running dry in money.  NOT a good thing.  

The company obviously expects to sell or JV when the time comes. The issue is if your competitors KNOW you are running dry there is no leverage in your negotiations since they KNOW one option is not to go on your own and start the commercialization process.

Contractors and their boots on the ground workers are NOT Investors.  They have bills to pay and salaries to pay and shares that make money sometime in the future does not help them.

Because the Company’s stockholders did not approve an increase in authorized shares, without implementing a potential reverse stock split that would reduce the number of outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock and thereby increase the shares available for issuance, the Company may not have the ability to raise additional capital as needed to support development, regulatory approval and potential commercialization of its product candidates.""

Fossil fuels aren't going anywhere for decades and short term I believe will have a high demand ratio similar to 2008. Air travel, shipping, and plastics still make up the biggest portion of Oil usage and natural gas is a clean burning enery which is a large part of the trust. Natural gas infrastructure for homes and power plants would cost trillions to replace and will take decades.

However for the moral investor Permian Basin Royalty Trust is located mostly on the edge of Penwell, Tx to Crane County where the first natural gas to gasoline plant is being built soon. It's a $7B project and the first of it's kind to have clean burning gasoline for vehicles that will be directly located adacent to the facilities offices that manage Permian Basin Royalty Trust.

983,gzegdnw,2021-05-25,t1_gzeej4k,pennystocks,"I think another method would be to check my profile, see what my posts have been about, verify when I posted them and how stocks I liked have performed since.

You can check my other posts, which are way more detailed in terms of scientific knowledge translated into simple language. That's what I have to offer.

But, I have a different suggestion for you.
