They raised some additional funding, but the same forces that sent them to bankruptcy will send them back to bankruptcy. The entire business model is done. You fools don’t even realize the the estimated sales you’re purchasing at those prices. You’re paying more today than GameStop in its PRIME back in 2006, nearly DOUBLE, yet sales are nearly 50% less and profits are down 70%. 

They will drain cash and end up in bankruptcy again. People buy games from the console. People buy consoles from Walmart. fundamentals always play out in the long run.

2008,gzmyy6q,2021-05-27,t1_gzmxf17,wallstreetbets,"Yup. And with such a big name, the support and the funds, im sure they could make it right.

Id love some leagues hosted by gme , a bit like sports leagues, in every neighborhood,  than scaling up to city tournaments and national and so on. 

It could become the leagues for all introvert kids. Mixing physical , social interactions to the world of gaming. 

Would be a great way to set up peons all accross the board, to bring the next step, a revolution the esports by making them mainstream. 

Imagine, as a parent, finally having a place for your introvert kids to make friends while praticing a sport they like rather than forcing them into soccer even if they hate it. Then, imagine , at school, some rivalries between kids. It would become a greatly talked subject, would draw more attention, bring in more players. I see exponential growth going that way. 

And gme being gme, can then stream events, have subscription revenues from the league, partnerships, sponsorships from gaming companies.

They would have multiple revenue streams, and at the same time would be advertising of products they sell. 

In the long run, theyre known as the place where so many kids discovered this passion and lived so many émotions and made friends, which means, a lot of customers who trust the company. And they end up being the leaders of all of it. After all, once these kids grow up, lots of them are still going to be gamers and they will now have jobs and money and will need some hardware and software for their gaming purposes at home. Guess who sells all of this? Their beloved gme, where it all started.

If you *strongly* believe your meme is higher quality than all the memes currently on r/wallstreetbets/hot, then you may message the moderators.

So this is a legitimate stat - 100k SNDL $1 call options were bought yesterday by retail investors. Whoever was selling $1 strike options expiring this Friday for a penny, you are so greedy and there’s a good chance you’re about to get your face ripped off.  
  
Retail shorts have hopped on the bandwagon and when stocks move they tend to over shoot the upside and the downside.  
  
Sundial has over $1 billion in cash, no debt, positive operating profit, and many valuable passive investments.  
  
The manipulation that the stock received was absolutely insane. Institutional ownership was less than 2% when SNDL made it’s run in Feb and the big boys didn’t want to miss the party and they paid motley fool to write bash articles while they accumulate their position. This is just my assumption, which is never a good thing when valuing stocks, but as a former stock analyst I would bet that institutional ownership will be over 5% very soon and then 10%.  
  
SNDL is breaking out with insane call volume bought today expiring Friday. This company has the fundamentals to back it up and very good things could be coming. Not to mention it’s a prime acquisition target with its super strong balance sheet.",[],0

* Vote recall.  Similar to above.  It may reveal some naked shorting but I don't believe price goes to $10M.  However I gave myself 3 extra weeks after the shareholder meeting.  Even if price goes to $10M, it doesn't stay there for very long, if anything it will be insanely brief.  But yea I don't think it even ever goes there.

* Non-fungible tokens creates a new narrative.  This might also help but I don't think it is enough to keep convincing new investors to FOMO at higher and higher prices.",[],0

Cinedigm Corp. engages in the marketing and distribution of movie, television, and other short form content managing a library of distribution rights. It operates through the segments; Cinema Equipment Business, and Content and Entertainment Business (CEG). The Cinema Equipment Business segment consists of the non-recourse, financing vehicles, and administrators. The Content and Entertainment Business refers to ancillary market aggregation and distribution of entertainment content and, branded and over-the-top (OTT) digital network business providing entertainment channels and applications.

It’s not all about inflation, and the data shows that it’s actually not really a great hedge against inflation in the long run. Stocks actually provide the best hedge against inflation. Also people seeing crypto have 30% overnight collapses hurts its attempt at becoming the full fledged digital gold, which is part of the reason for the recent rally as you mentioned. At the very least I think we will see Gold hit all time highs before backing off if it can’t break the resistance.

5856,gzn4kx6,2021-05-27,t1_gzk7ked,wallstreetbets,"Noob as well, but (I think) he basically has option to buy 500 shares (5 option contracts) of AMC for $40/share. Cost of buying those options was 50 cents per share or $250 total. I don't think the OP wants or plans to buy it for 40 but the play seems to be that as the price goes up, the ""value"" (what he could sell it for/what it would cost someone else to buy it) of the option increases. As of the time of the post, the value per share went from $0.50 to $1.15 (so the options he paid $250 for, he could sell for $575, hence the $325 profit). The closer the AMC prices gets to 40 the more the options will be worth because the greater the chances it goes above 40 and ends up in the money for the call holder (e.g. a $40 call when stock is $35 is going to cost a lot more then when stock is $15 and a long shot to ever get to $40). If I understand this correctly, and noob here so just learning how options strategies work, the play is to sell it before it expires and take the profits from selling the call option, not to hope it gets above $40 and exercise the option.  Similarly, with the $15 call - which cost more than 3x to buy (i.e. 1.55 vs. 0.50), the ""value"" of the call option has already increased to $6.15 (an increase of $4.60 per share or $4,600 per option contract since 1 option is 100 shares). OP has 115 contracts (11,500 shares) and so the profit he could get right now from selling the option contracts is $4.60 x 11,500 (which is what the $52,900 represents).  In simpler terms, you buy a call option, hope the stock goes way up, thereby increasing the cost of the same call option, and sell that option before it expires and take the profit.

But I agree. This has dangerous rug pull written all over it. The thesis of a $100k floor is fundamentally wrong and a lot of the people counting on it are new. Anyone who bought in anywhere near $20 is in rough waters.

The sole redeeming piece of the $100k floor is that 80% of the shares are held by retail. I wouldn’t count on it, but this price could really climb if buying holds and selling from the holders stops. Again, your piece about the restricted selling certainly hurts that.

But the thing is, every time this happens.... this IS “a squeeze”. T You caan have a squeeze an infinite amount of times as long as there is enough interest behind a stock, but you don’t realize the squeeze happening right before your eyes lol. People here keep saying “to the moon” expecting not 1000 dollars (lol), but 100k or things like that etc.

There is not limit as for the amount of times something can squeeze if there is enough force behind the stock, but there is a limit on how high it can get, and you’ll be holding bags... again lol (and again). Unless, of course, you sell at its peak (a reasonable peak, not shit like 1000 dollars), which would be a good play, but something I think few will do due to “diamond hands”.

I am personally just confident that AMC will have a sustainable business model that can generate revenue and healthy growth.

Movie theaters are reopening now so money is going back into theaters.

I personally believe that AMC could reinvent itself and jump into the streaming platform business competing with Netflix, Amazon etc.

That's the most logical approach for me.

Movies aren't going anywhere or do you see a world where everyone watches nee movies form their tiny TV at home?

I really don't believe that.

That's just my take on that, that's why I bought it at the very low, before all the AMC and GME madness. Hope this helped","['GME', 'AMC']",0

GME squeezed only Tuesday and Wednesday.

You pay a fee which gives you an option.

The option you gain is whether you want to buy 100 shares or not.

You buy the 100 shares at a set price depending on which option you paid a fee for.

If you choose the option to not to buy the 100 shares, you're still out the fee.

If you choose the option to buy the 100 shares, you get to buy the 100 shares at the set price that you paid a fee for.

Then you turn around and sell the shares. Or not.

You can also sell your option to someone else. Like if you don't have the money to buy the 100 shares.

1) call option you are expecting the price to go up.
2) puts option you are expecting to go down.

long term options the price will be more but give you have longer time in market.
 short term options the price will be cheaper but you have less time in market.

Also the price depends on volatility of the stock.

Expiry time: the time your contract expires, before it expires you need to do either of these two.

1) sell your contract, don’t wait till the end you can only sell if there is some one to buy it. If you wait on the last day the chances are you won’t be able to sell it.

2) exercise the contract: which mean based on you contract you would have said I will buy the stock at $9 if it goes up $15. You can only do this if it’s goes above $15( which is your break even price)",[],1

Puts - pretty much the opposite of calls where you are expecting a stock price to fall and gives the option to sell (put) the stock a specific strike price. (Same ex: F is 14.99 but think it’s going to drop. You buy a put option to sell F at 12.99 at 2.00 per 100)... if the stock price drops below 10.99 (12.99-2.00) you make profit

I saw that it was trending down and bought a lot of options on the chance we'd get a turnaround so like when it was $10/share.  If you jump into Meme stocks right now you should expect to lose and have a $1000 lesson.  I would recommend starting with something safe and easy that you're not going to have these types of swings.  It will give you an opportunity to learn about the greets and what time decay is and IV.  Youtube learning options to get the basics and go onto /r/options to buy some safe ones at first.  I'd get into something like FCX or MT that are companies doing extremely well this year and most likely going to go up slowly and actually give you a higher probability of a win.  This $$ I invested was completely disposable income and I was willing to lose all of it.  Get an account on Fidelity, NOT ROBINHOOD, and apply for options and throw $1,000 into it and I can DM you and try to help you find some options that expire in like September which will give you a few months to see it go up and down.
