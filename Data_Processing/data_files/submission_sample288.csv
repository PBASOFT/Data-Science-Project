4,2021-05-23,investing,"SPACs might be dead (sorry Chamath), but this one merger has a cult-like following as the buzz around the name continues to grow. This SPAC is IPOE and the merger is with FinTech company SoFi. Brick and mortar banks and queuing in line for services is so 2019, in 2021 this process has become *digitized* and the goal is to have a bank in your *pocket*.

**Banks vs FinTech**

The expansion of financial services and cross-selling of them to existing customers has been a common strategy for traditional banks and finch companies alike. Traditional banks have a massive, already established customer base that they can easily cross sell other financial services to. In fact, the top 15 banks in the world control over 50% of all US bank accounts.

SoFi’s moat surrounds 3 different segments:

1. Lending: Personal/student loans and refinancing
2. Tech Platform: Galileo acquisition and payments infrastructure
3. Financial Services: Investing, credit cards, money transfers, etc

**Galileo**

I want to touch up on Galileo because SoFi’s acquisition of the company was highly strategic and has enabled them to integrate at a larger scale. Galileo is a B2B purchasing/payment platform that works with FinTech entities such as Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, and Revolut. With the Galileo platform, these companies can create complex financial payment processes and enable digital banking solutions. Think of Galileo as the infrastructure behind it all and they are growing by over 100% YoY.

**Trends & Growth**

So why don’t the banks just use their existing customer base to expand into the FinTech industry? Short answer: Because they are BOOMERS. The truth is their legacy infrastructure and IT costs do not help when transitioning into the FinTech space. As per Morgan Stanley, most FinTech startups can actually offer these services at nearly 50% cheaper than the traditional banks.

There are some tailwinds the industry is riding that ranges from more and more customers accessing banking services digitally (this number is even higher among millennials), rise in digital payments by over 20% from 2019 into 2020, and FinTech becoming increasingly popular among personal loans.

SoFi’s customer base has been growing at an average of 66% YoY with their last two quarters hitting 75% growth each. It is no doubt that the platform, the industry, and everything about the business is becoming increasingly popular. Management has noted by year-end 2021 they are expecting to hit over 3 million members (currently at 1.7 million).

**Conclusion**

What was mentioned above paints a picture that FinTech is disrupting traditional firms across all avenues of financial services (loans, investments, and banking). Traditional banks are failing to keep ahold of the new generation of customers coming into the market. SoFi is able to circumvent the inefficiencies in our current financial systems and provide unparalleled customer service for all their services.",njdcw5,[],0

46,2021-05-23,investing,"Hi all – I'm struggling to grasp exactly how shorting forex works. The material I've read seems to leave out critical info. Basically they say that shorting is selling a currency pair, where the you expect the ""base"" currency to fall in value. For example, this breakdown by IG: https://www.ig.com/us/trading-strategies/learn-how-to-short-a-currency-190712

But that's the end of their explanation. How does merely selling a currency pair result in a profit? Where and when are you realizing a profit?

Say you start with $10,000 USD, you short the USD, and you're right and it falls in value during the relevant period. Where's your profit coming from in this scenario? Tangibly, how do you end up having more than $10,000 in the bank when it's over? 

For stocks, shorting is supposed to involve ""borrowing"" shares of stock, selling them, waiting for the drop, and then buying and returning the shares to whomever lended them to you. (I have no idea how one borrows shares of stock, but apparently it's a thing.) The explanations for shorting forex don't mention any comparable process of borrowing, selling, and re-buying the currency. So how do you profit in the forex case?

Thanks.",njdwfk,[],0

Regarding RH PFOF -

I noticed after Q3 of last year RH stopped reporting venue-specific information in their [Held NMS Stocks and Options Order Routing Public Report](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q3%202020.pdf)

I'm not looking for any conspiracies I'm just wondering if there is some sort of loophole RH found in lack of necessity to list entity-specific execution services by using an umbrella company, or if SEC regulation changed.

It's a question purely out of curiosity, I was wondering since the [C&D](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2020/33-10906.pdf) settlement if it made public information specific toward particular stocks/assets with it's PFOF dependent on the service, i.e. if there were divisions dependent on certain assets/order types being directed or non-directed. (Directed meaning RH as customer as obviously it isn't wasn't necessarily a concern for it's actual customers until then).

730,2021-05-14,investing,"I posted some of this yesterday and didn't get much traction in daily questions of r/investing, so I'm going to rework it for this sub:

tldr, I'm having a crisis of confidence in buy-and-hold index investing strategy

**Backstory:**

I'm 38 and live in the USA. I'm employed, and I make the median national income. I want to accrue wealth over the long term. I don't know that I have an accurate understanding of my risk tolerance. I think generally I am very cautious. Before yesterday I was about 70% equities, 15 bonds, 15 cash. I just sold off a lot of my stock. I'm waiting for the account to settle to see my new allocation, but I'm certainly under 50% stocks at this time. I have no debts.

I have been a buy & hold index fund investor for the 20 years of my adult life. It always sort of bothered me that I didn't understand the underlying mechanisms of the markets I was investing in. At some point in the last decade I learned about the Schiller p/e index and thought ""hmm, this doesn't seem good..."" I read *Random Walk,* and I think I understood most of it.

**The Bug Out:**

Recently, I heard a Grantham interview and read some Hussman, and their gloomy prognostication really struck a chord with my natural inclination towards pessimism. They say current prices are unthethered from the underlying assets and and that this is true across all sectors of the market. My friends and the forums are full people  throwing money at speculative investments (crypto, SPAC, etc). My elders are telling me to blindly invest in an index fund and forget about it, because 'historic returns, don't miss the market's big days, it worked for them, etc.'

My armchair diagnosis is that there are a lot of people like me that are blindly investing in broad index funds that could care less about the underlying value of the assets as long as the price keeps going up. I suspect at some time in the future we'll look back and see that index funds were a craze like any other and laugh at the certainly we currently feel that these assets will return 6-8% on average until the end of time. Looking at you Vanguard (who recently told me that a 'normal asset allocation' was 90-95% stocks...hmm). I also think we'll look back and see that the last trick the boomers played on us was propping up their asset valuations with Fed policy and leaving us to hold the bag.

Worst of all, it doesn't seem like anyone I speak these concerns to (friends, family, investment advisors) is really taking them seriously or even hearing them. Am I turning into a flat-earther? Is the king wearing any clothes?

**What Now?**

I've been told you shouldn't try to time the market, and I've read the explainers about how I'm likely to mistime by selling below the peak, buying before the trough, and missing out on gains while out of the market. Frankly, I'm at a point where I don't believe in the market at all. Is not believing in the market at all the same as timing it?

I've heard that market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. I've also read that by definition there is never greater certainty in the market than the day before the bubble pops.

I'm not sure I can just put all of my money in an index fund and sleep at night.  I have the following questions. Have some of you had a bug-out like I'm having now and that led you to value investing? Do you still believe in index funds in this current market? The knowledge requirements to be a value investor seem much higher than for an index-fund investor. It's crazy intimidating. Do I just start reading your investment bibles and leave my money on the sidelines until I understand how make investment decisions in individual companies?
