&nbsp;

I opened a Fidelity account in late January to hop on the GME train. I gave them all my personal info, everything they asked for, all honestly. I trade for a month.

&nbsp;

Then one day I log in to make an important trade and it says my accounts have been closed. No notification, no warning, just closed my accounts out of nowhere. 

&nbsp;

I missed out on $10,000+ of profit on the RKT trade I was going to make. It doesn't even give a reason WHY they closed my accounts, and there is nothing you can do it address this issue on their website. YOU CAN'T EVEN WITHDRAW THE CASH YOU HAVE. THEY DISABLE THE CASH TRANSFER FEATURE, HOLDING YOUR MONEY HOSTAGE.

&nbsp;

I call (this is a month after the GME squeeze, everything should have calmed down) and I'm on hold for TWO FUCKING HOURS.

&nbsp;

I'm fucking livid. I demand to know why they closed my accounts, and they say they ""need more verification"" and they want me to fill out some IRS form or some shit with a bunch of personal info.

&nbsp;

What the fuck? I already gave them all my info, and I have an extremely unique name so it's not like my info conflicted with someone else. These shitbags closed my accounts out of nowhere without even bothering to send me an email about it, causing me to lose out of thousands of dollars. They've essentially stolen my money by making it impossible for me to withdraw, AND THEN they keep me on hold for two fucking hours. I demand they send my money back.

&nbsp;

Here's the best part. FIDELITY REFUSES TO GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY. They insist that I HAVE TO fill out a form with a bunch of info then wait an indeterminate amount of time before I'm even allowed to withdraw my own money.

&nbsp;

It's not until I start threatening to sue for theft and/or fraud that they send my money back to me.

&nbsp;

Fuck Fidelity. Shady, scumbag company. Don't use them.",['GME'],0

Last week, it was raised again to $16 after AMC tackled more of it's debt thanks to the sell off and they're financial outlook improved. The point is, analyst themselves are baffled and you miss the point of AMC and other stocks like it on WSB. The stocks value is whatever the investor thinks it's worth until it's not. Or until the suits cockblock like they did back in January. Plain and simple. Don't misunderstand. I don't have my life savings in this lol. I have a very small stake, but only to show support to WSB. 

If you're on here to ""own"" me or ""troll"" me. You're doing it to the wrong person. Much less, you're in the wrong thread. You seem to belong in the comments section on YouTube Mad Money channel or other channels like it. If you haven't figured it out. People on WSB don't care if they lose money. Shit. I don't care. My small stake is meaningless and won't leave me in the poor house. Not by a long shot Lmao. So, take your analysis elsewhere. WSB has heard it all and has proven everyone wrong. Will it last. Maybe. Maybe not. One thing is true though, WSB has stirred pot and has gotten under people's skin. Frankly, I enjoy watching the suits and their supporters squirm.",['AMC'],0

For instance, say I deposit funds sufficient to push account balance over $25 k (at least 2 business days) before I PDT over the course of a few weeks. After those weeks are over, I cash out, bringing my balance back below $25k, but I no longer PDT after doing so. 

In that scenario, would I still be flagged as a PDT and would the account become frozen for 90 days as soon as I took my money out, leaving me unable to make non PDT trades with any remaining funds? Basically what I’m getting at, is that once I’m flagged as a PDT must I always keep the account above $25k from there on to avoid a penalty, or could I go back below $25k, provided I did not PDT’d after doing so?",[],0

The vast majority of weeks with expiring options in a bull run have downtrends, where MMs try to kill the value of call contracts written. Typically we then resume the upturn the week afterwards. A few notable exceptions however, like February where the week after OpEx continued the bloodbath. I doubt we see volatility like that next week (and to be perfectly honest I think next week can go either way, I'm not really sure which), but it could very feasibly see a re-test of 400 on SPY and the NAS retracing another % or two. Think of it this way .. the market needs catalysts to run up or down. The weeks anticipating incredible ERs give reason to run up; a week where Options being ITM presents risk gives a reason to run down. A lot of the short term moves are psychology based.

If you were to take your certificate, your physical certificate and hand it to someone else, you would then have to report that to an A 000 D 000 Facility.

Congratulations, you have now made a dark pool trade. The the real issues of the lack of transparency into brokerage and market structures combined with sec's continual rolling back of rules that would harm short sellers. This allows short sellers to manipulate markets.

When you put your orders through to someone like Robin Hood they don't send your orders to the market. They send it to the market maker like sh-itadel where sh-itadel gives them a share from their store of reserves from off market and then they decide whether they want to create an Failing da deliver share, borrow a short share, or just sell off some of the stock that they're holding in their reserve. This causes the market to go down even though retail is buying because the buy order is go to sh-itadel and Sh-itadel fills them either with fake shares or off market shares.

When the price drops, retail gets scared and start selling their shares back at a loss allowing Sh-itadel to replenish the reserves and doing it all over again.",[],1

Well rocket up to like 280 and pause, probably for the rest of the day. Then WSB will fomo in and well see 450.

This is when the squeeze is on the launching pad. Almost anything below 450 is just retail buying up and naturally raising the price. Then margin calls go out and shorts have 5 days to cover. We'll see a few bursts of buying followed by a highly volatile 5 days.

OTM is also the place where savings can be destroyed.

With 10K I could buy roughly 50 calls for Sept @6, or I could buy 660  $20 calls.  If it rockets up to $25, the $6 calls would be worth $50 x19x100 =95,000, but the $20 calls would be worth $330,000.

Granted, I don't think that far out of the money is realistic for UWMC by September, but it's a higher torque bet, with a lambo payoff.  But, I could be wrong and have left lambo money on the table.

3504,gz059w2,2021-05-22,t3_nht2ep,wallstreetbets,"Just reading through the patent for the inertial drive there are some cringeworthy statements. 

It’s highly suspect. For the example they give of spinning a coulomb charge on a metal disk 1M in diameter. The capacitance of such a disk is on the order of micro farads which means the voltages need to be in the megavolts to get anywhere near a coulomb of charge on it. That’s some serious van de Graf generation going on, let alone arc insulation. 

They need to pick up orders of magnitude voltage enhancement to get anywhere near where any of these effects could possibly happen. 

As for competing tech. The worlds most intense laser fields are only now just attempting to reach >10^18 J/cm^2 in intensity and only on femtosecond timescales. 

If there’s anything that can reach these power levels it’s got to involve manipulation of inner shell atomic fields. Unlikely and hard to do in a macroscopic fashion without fields cancelling out between individual atoms. 

Otherwise there needs to be some magic trick that is not listed in the patent. Some kind of coherence previously undiscovered that enables high EM field generation at least locally within materials. 

All very dubious.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",[],0

Le fait que WSB ait tellement grandi en si peu de temps est pitoyable et idiot. Nous avons subi un afflux dur et préjudiciable de perdants qui dominent ce sous-marin et tentent de le forcer dans une direction qui ruinera la culture des wallstreetbets et, finalement, inaugurera une nouvelle ère de salopes. Je souhaite que je pourrais appuyer sur un bouton et revenir à une époque antérieure à GME; un âge d'or rempli de pipi martinis et de mèmes incroyables, ainsi que d'utilisateurs (auparavant) actifs tels que u / CasuallyExplained - qui, en particulier, ont publié certains des contenus de la plus haute qualité que ce sous-marin ait jamais vu. Heureusement, je vois un soulèvement contre les «singes» de Dipshit GME.

4227,gz085v7,2021-05-22,t3_ni1fw5,wallstreetbets,"""The problem is that technical analysis is a misnomer. Reading a chart is much more like playing piano than it is like running an analysis. Thus, we have entirely the wrong image for its study.  
  
Here’s what I mean: I’d bet that 90% of people who set out to play piano give up long before ever learning to play at a proficient level. An academic could argue, after a study of all people who have ever played piano, that playing piano is not statistically possible. In fact, it appears to be more about luck than skill—there are few variables that correlate to people who play piano well.  
  
What does correlate? Practice. People who practice piano everyday, for years, are the people who can play well. We can’t even really explain how—they just do. You can run all the linear regressions you want, all the mathematical analysis you want, it doesn’t help because you have approached the problem in entirely the wrong manner.  
  
Here is what we do know:  
  
1. The human mind is currently the most powerful pattern recognition software in the universe.  
a. Therefore, it recognizes nonexistent patterns in randomness.  
b. Therefore, it is capable of recognizing very subtle signals in noise.  
2. To recognize actual patterns, the mind must be trained.  
3. If something is profitable, people will do it.  
a. If something is not profitable, people will eventually stop doing it.  
4. People don’t like to work hard.  
  
Those facts combine to yield some interesting results. For example, combine 1a, 2, 3, and 4, and you have a recipe for crappy training programs (which we see a ton of). Combine 1a, 3a, and 4, and technical analysis ceases to exist.  
  
If you combine all of them, you get exactly what we see in the world: a TON of crappy training programs, a TON of people who put in little to no work then stop, and very few people who achieve any level of proficiency and reap hard-won profits.  
  
Which is exactly what you find with playing the piano.""

You seem quite logical actually. Your experience trading far outweighs mine. May I ask why you believe that was the major squeeze?

You're on the standpoint it seems that we should all understand that these HFs do this for a living 16 hours a day right? And to respect the opposition. And I do, this is chess not checkers. If I were a HF I would mask my plays to make it look like I covered, make my original SI% pre january pay off. I think they doubled down on a bluff with the coverings. I dont just buy into memes etc like a lot of GME holders I try to follow the logic, your logic is to respect what the HF are capable of, and I do. Im trying to think like them.

I don't think this falls under financial advice as I am not asking for any. But here is what I am getting at. In my quest for more knowledge, I am starting to see more and more analysts and actual business owners talk about an impending crash. Also, inflation due to the US's stimulus (which we needed, but that is political and not the goal of this comment). With all the growth we had in such a short amount of time, like well y'all earlier this year. I think we are headed to actual depression. Not recession but actual literal depression. I just saw the Bill Ackman interview and if what he is saying about inflation comes to fruition literally no one is going to be able to afford shit.

Then you know we kinda just said nah stocks only go up and injected a shit ton of money. The question is how much do we fear a healthy pullback. Because we feared it so much that time we really made it twice as bad when we finally do let it happen or run out of options to keep it going. We’ll get one but when we let it happen, that’s a lot harder to time I feel. Everything going back to normal in life is very positive news but the market obviously isn’t taking it as so positive. When it is a mostly normal again in a few months do we see stocks start to go up again and say we weathered the storm using policy and action, or do we see stocks return to “normal” preCOVID levels too? Right now it’s looking like the more positive news that comes out is taking those 2020-2021 gains from the companies that spiked during that time. I’m almost all in on VIAC right now after averaging down my 6/18 50c the last few weeks and at break even now. After hopefully taking some profit next week I don’t think I’m going to make any really big moves for awhile. It’s getting harder and harder this year to make the type of trades I make and longer horizons to potential profit. I don’t think I want to expose that much capital for a month at a time with all those questions above unanswered. Not going cash gang but maybe splitting it up and selling CC on a few things for awhile to see what happens.",[],0

Tell recently cleaned up their debt, diluted shares to position themselves for growth (this would be a bad sign if they didnt just pay off a bunch of loans), and essentially did a big PR event saying they're going to start making actual progress again soon.

I sure as hell wouldn’t park the account in cash, SPY, or SH (the short SPY). All three are looking too damn risky. Low PE long legacy companies with good books will be hit the least hard and start recovering faster if the drop did happen so I’m going to be piling it into those. 

I see things being choppy but holding on this path now until fall, the main concern I have personally is that we’ve exhausted all our options if another catalyst causes it to go down like COVID did. Can’t lower rates again that would not be met well by anyone, can’t stimulate the economy and beef up social welfare programs to get money into business and the market because then we would have major inflation problems. It’s just one thing away from really feeling like 08/09 again where we did too much to prop it up and ran out of things to do when a catalyst came along.

Is this your DD? We have already seen $420+ on the 1st week of this month and $405- during the 2nd week. Next week has 5 trading days and considering todays closing price of $515, it's a 1.02% uptrend to cross $420 or 2.41% downtrend. A fluctuation of 1-2.5% in 5 trading days is very normal for SPY and you do not need to eat crayon to say that.

You say W shape? There is no W shape in that chart. If you forcefully try to make a flat line between 14th, 17th and 18th to a point, it doesn't become a point!

>Current support at 60 SMMA   
>  
>Current resistance at 20 SMMA

This is idiotic at best. Do you even understand what a moving average filter is? The resulting value is moving along time. How can a moving point be either support or resistance? 

You say if the SP is above X price it's bullish and if it's below Y price it's bearish. There are bull call support and bear put support bla bla bla. Did you looks at the OI and volume of SPY contracts for the last month? It has always been on the bearish side yet SPY move upward. 

Give it up TA does not work. Do not get confused and make other's confused trying to be smarter. Instead of saying SPY can vary 2.5% in next 5 trading days clearly say what will be the price on Monday at open, at midday and at close. If you can't say that that admit TA doesn't work.",[],0

Can act as support or resistance

a 50-day, 100-day, 200-day, MA act as a support

Open your tool and then open 1 year SPY chart then plot 50-day, 100-day and 200-day MA and tell me what you see. Let me tell you what you will see-

200-day MA is never being touched in last 9 months

 100-day MA was touched twice and it dipped below that line once out of two times which means 50% probability.

50-day MA was touched 7 times and dipped below that line 3 times which means 42.8% times it did not bounced.

Now open the AMZN and do all over again. What you see? It almost never works. Instead of sharing that investopedia link if you could try to understand what a moving average is you would know why SP is above that line in a uptrend or below that line in a downtrend. It's not due to how stock market works, neither it's some TA magic. It's the definition of moving average itself. 

Look at other tickers as well you will see that claim fails miserably most times. Sometimes it might align with your claim but that's not due to some TA magic rather the nature of random number. You know coin flip!

I traded it during the initial big rush. I did not buy and hold. I didn't take it as a personal or emotional thing. I liked that retail traders stuck it to hedge funds. They didn't expect it. 

I did daily swing trades with GME and AMC, exploiting a clear pattern I saw in how it traded. 

Once the pattern didn't work, I sold off and didn't get involved in it again. 

I made a good amount of money thanks to the mania. 

The idea that hedge funds are still in a bad position in these stocks is nonsense. 

They got caught out once, learned and have shifted their approach to siphon off money from retail traders and other institutional traders.

These are MASSIVE institutions with the best and the brightest working for them. They can trade off market. They have computers trading for them.

The idea that they've just been getting hammered because of retail traders is silly. So is the amount of power retail traders think they have. They make up a tiny amount of the market relative to institutions.

Hedge funds own GME stock and they own short positions. They make money when it goes up and make money when it goes down.

Right now, all my positions (with a few exceptions) are based on the stock market crash which I believe 100% is on its way. I just don't know when exactly. Could be Monday, could be two years from now - but it's coming.

I saw the dip coming last week. I saw the one earlier in the year. I made money on both. I hope to make money on the next one.

Given that crypto just tanked today, it's likely the stock market is about to do the same. If you look at the charts for BTC and NDX, they are totally correlated lately.","['GME', 'AMC']",0

On May 8, PLTR was between $18.18-$19.30 and todays closing price was $20.75.

8922,gz0vt2f,2021-05-22,t3_ni23jp,wallstreetbets,"I see some big problems about why apes didn't get a gamma and short Squeeze today.
1- People buy because the hype and not because they like the company and the fundamentals. And when a bad or fake new comes they lose the faith and sell losing money.
2- I know that coordinate buys can be consider market manipulation, but short sellers have been doing it and maybe apes should do it in a way nobody get caught. Until now every ape bought anytime and many times it was not effective at all. Apes need a plan.
3- Apes try to Squeeze too many stocks at the same time. AMC, GME again...and many others. I remember that some apes were throwing shit on clover because they were trying to Squeeze another one. Apes don't have enough money and press power to Squeeze 5 or 10 companies at the same time.
This said...I am a long term investor and I just have clover stocks, not AMC, GME... And I don't have more money to invest. I am invested 100% and clover is just 4% of my portfolio.
But I like WSB movement and want to help with some ideas.
In my opinion, WSB should basically:
1- Find someone who can coordinate the timing and the target.  (Find a Cesar, like in the movie, apes strong together).
2- Coordinate the % of the shares that each ape is going to buy and distribute it on time to be effective on the price and the final profit. For example. Every ape buy now 20% of the total invest under 7 in the next 2 weeks. After this, push the price strategically to 8 or 9 with 30% of every ape investment and hold the like with 10% more. Finally use the other 40% in the final attack when a great new happen to clover (SEC clear the investigation, Biden down to 60 Medicare age...)(clover is just an example, can apply to any other stock trying to be Squeeze).
3- Chose just 1 target per time. When you get the Squeeze, sell every ape 5% a day to avoid some apes got trapped holding the bag. And with all the profits, when you finish one Squeeze start the next one with the extra funds. It will make a snowball effect and every Squeeze will be easier than the last one if you chose well due to bigger money amount to push.
I think with this method you could get to Squeeze any company with more than 30% SI and a market cap under 10B.

This literally just fucking happened 5 mins ago and my heart still racing. I live in a gated, hilly community decently upscale.

It’s pretty late and my windows rolled down, I hear the gate of the courts open behind my car. 

I was shocked frozen, with it being that late, not thinking someone would be there chilling too. But then someone in a creepy ass fucking voice I swear coming from behind like it was super close said “Hey” in this raspy ass creepy voice.

I’m a dumbass for having all my windows rolled the fuck down cuz I’m surprised the fucker didn’t jump in and try something.
