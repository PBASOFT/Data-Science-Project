You can see what all the insiders have been doing.  Also, sometimes you just need to keep your ear to the ground. Right when Blackberry was starting to meme, they issued a PR saying they didn't know why their stock was going up, and that their CEO (?) had recently sold all of his shares. Never a good sign. My historical favorite has been AEO, and I do whatever the CEO does. His family has been in the industry for a few generations IIRC, and he always seems to know exactly when to buy at the bottom. He often also knows when to sell at the top. So I just follow that stock long-term. Sometimes I go 2-3 years without investing in it, then when it drops, I'll hit it hard. But I keep my eye on news articles every month or 2.  
And watch out for high dividend yields; they look nice now, but that can indicate a problem with the stock. Example: if the share price goes down 50%, the dividend yield goes up 100%. The company is much more likely to cut it to conserve cash. If you like high dividends tho, I found HRZN last year. They are a ""business development company's and regularly pay out 7-10% per year. The stock might be a little pricey now; I last bought at $13 and haven't bought more, since all stocks seem a little high. I'm kinda getting my toes wet with them and they're earning more and more of my trust with each passing quarter.",,

There is a lot of rotation going on right now and you have many external factors such as the fed printer, worries about inflation and fears of increased capital tax gains affecting the current sentiment . Tech stocks and many of the big winners have lost their momentum. Why wouldn’t they? Stock market as a whole has gone up in a straight line since last March and smart money is taking profit at any chance they get. Bezos has been cashing in on his AMZN shares at any opportunity, and many companies offered secondaries when they were up earlier in the year.

Theoretically an FTD is anything that didnt clear, right? For a trade that is T+3 and an option contract its T+2. This info is generated by the SEC, but why isn't it generated by the clearinghouse?

Anyway here are some highlights so far for 2021: 
(taking price on report multiplied by shares FTD)
Nearly $306B in FTD securities value
*needs to be mentioned the SEC doesn't report sub penny
15,557 tickers had an FTD
21.9B shares are reported FTD

It surprises me to see ETFs, Spiders, and really this much volume. I am not new to the market, but new to this level of analysis. Is this normal? This just seems holistically inefficient. Would a real time, or near real time, clearing process resolve this mess? I believe it would.

Hwang makes a swap contract basically saying this underlying asset(stock) will go up. When it does, the banks keep some of the profit in fees and the rest goes to him. The banks buy the stock so that the underlying asset exists, which pumps the stock. This is why Hwang never shows up as a buyer, but banks do. Banks owned as much as 10% of Viacom. 

A downside to not owning the stock himself: the banks pulled the plug when the stock started trading sideways. Then the margin calls come.

""Sell in May and go away."" 

The whole market is indeed down. Stocks rose in May, so a lot of people are selling towards the end of May. 

Institutional investors might be doing some rotation and locking in profits. Couple that with retail investors possibly looking to put money into more speculative stocks, and this is what you get.

When everything is going down, a few anomalies may get propped up. 

To put things into perspective, the SP500 is still over 4000 points. Looking from the ATH, this isn't even a correction yet. 

To begin with, you shouldn't put faith into the market because you will inevitably lose that faith. Markets are what they are. If you own index funds, pullbacks just mean dollar cost averaging. If you own individual stocks that you liked at X price, then, provided you have liquidity, you should absolutely adore that stock at 0.8X. My personal favorite stock has dipped below my previous average price and I've been buying that dip for almost a week now. It just keeps dipping and I'm running out of liquidity, but I honestly don't care because I've read zero news about why it's going down - so this is just an opportunity for me.",,

But I think that pharmaceutical companies don't have nearly as much of an incentive to discover new antibiotics or antivirals . . . when they could be developing antidepressants or anti-hypertensive medication which requires the patient to take a pill every day for basically the rest of their life. 

For example, this one pharmaceutical company discovered a revolutionary new antibiotic that was a versatile tool against resistant strains of bacteria like MRSA and VRE . . . and the CDC basically reviewed their data and said ""Wow, this is a great new drug you got there. But you aren't allowed to put it on the market. Because the bacteria are adapting to every antibiotic we got so far, so we need at least one ace up our sleeve. So if a super-resistant bacterial strain goes around trying to kill everyone, we'll have one weapon that they ain't never seen yet""

302,,2021-05-20 06:05:50,t3_ngsgcn,,stocks," Frontline Ltd., a shipping company, engages in the seaborne transportation of crude oil and oil products worldwide. It owns and operates oil and product tankers. As of December 31, 2020, the company operated a fleet of 68 vessels. It is also involved in the charter, purchase, and sale of vessels.

Starting with a PE ratio of 4 and a PB ratio of 1 is always a good start. But then again most taker companies are now trading at a low PE ratio. Their net income, revenue and profit margin were increasing in the last 3 years which is a really good sign. One not so good sign is their debt which has increased from 1.8 to 2.2 billion in the last 4 years.

You could consider that shipping oil is not a good business anymore because renewables but changing to renewables cannot be done in an instant so the transition will be slow. For example the Chinese oil consumption reached an all time high in December 2020. In the same time a lot of companies have reduced their number of shipping vessels due to the low demand in last year. 

To take something from their SEC filling regarding risk:

“The demand for our oil tankers derives primarily from demand for Arabian Gulf, West African, North Sea, Caribbean, Russian and US Shale crude oil, which, in turn, primarily depends on the economies of the world's industrial countries and competition from alternative energy sources. Any decrease in shipments of crude oil or change in trade patterns from the above mentioned geographical areas would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Among the factors which could lead to such a decrease are:

• increased crude oil production from other areas;

• increased refining capacity in the Arabian Gulf or West Africa;

• increased use of existing and future crude oil pipelines in the Arabian Gulf or West Africa;

• a decision by oil-producing nations to increase their crude oil prices or to further decrease or limit their crude oil production;

• armed conflict in the Arabian Gulf and West Africa and political or other factors; and

• the development, availability and the costs of nuclear power, natural gas, coal and other alternative sources of energy. In addition, volatile economic conditions affecting world economies may result in reduced consumption of oil products and a decreased demand for our vessels and lower charter rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and our ability to pay dividends. “

I don’t really know how to evaluate these so I will let you evaluate them. They also say that “If the tanker industry, which historically has been cyclical and volatile, declines in the future, our revenues, earnings and available cash flow may be adversely affected.“ which basically means the earnings might go up or they might go down. The same is with the stock price.

Personally I think they will do well at least the next year because the demand for oil is still high, China is running on all cylinders because they need more and more energy, the airlines will start having more airplanes in the sky which will kickstart refineries and until “green solutions“ kick in we will need something.

This is just for information purposes, it is not investment advice, I am not an investing professional. Do your own due diligence before investing.

Have a good week!

It did dive during Covid, but has since recovered, which led me to nice gains (200%) on the last purchase. But usually I just sell it immediately for the 15% gain they let us purchase for 15% off. 

But I’m thinking, is this really that great of a deal? 

I put in 10% of my paycheck. So this is post tax money. 

I’m in about the 15% avg tax rate. 

So say I make $100,000 a year. (Married we make around $220,000 after deductions)

I am taxed $15,000 annually. (15%) 

I put in $8500 of post tax money into the ESPP. ($85,000*10%). 

Company lets me buy at 15% discount. So I get let’s say $9,775. So I spent $8,500 to get $9,775. Nice! 

Then I pay short term capital gains tax of $195. So that’s a net of $9584. 

But I was taxed on that initial $8500. 15% is my avg bracket. So that pre tax money was $9775. So now I’m losing money. I earned $10,000 to make $9584. 

Why not just put this directly into my 401k where I am not taxed on it (obviously until I retire) and my $10,000 (10%) is a real $10,000 into my account?

In the context of trading, imagine everyone is super hyped about the new Tesla model. A bunch of newbie investors buy stock ahead of its release. The release comes, and the reception is lukewarm. Some of these newbie investors get nervous and sell their stock. Other newbie investors see this and panic sell.

Suddenly, the price tanks and smarter investors see the long term potential and snatch up cheap stocks. The newbies see the price climbing again and buy back in hoping to make some money up from their panic selling. One of the newbies gets nervous again and cashes out, causing another dip from panic selling, leading to *more* stocks being bought for cheap.

When it's people, there's a lot of ""what ifs"" involved because of human nature and the inherent slowness of not being computers.

He had Tesla buy ‘coins, whose price is largely influenced by his tweets. If tweeting is fun, I can imagine tweeting and watching an asset price move in response has to be even more! Owning said asset probably entitles to some additional giggles.

Then last quarter Tesla sold some of the bitthings to “prove liquidity”. I’m not sure if anyone felt the need of such proof, but by lucky coincidence this had the totally unintended side effect to allow Tesla to post a profit for the quarter. Cheers!

How could this story become even more amusing?
Here is a possibility: if the coins price falls below the estimated $3,700 buying price and Tesla still HODL it next quarter, it will have to immediately report a loss on it.

Given Elon’s loving care for Tesla’s share price, if ‘coin price keeps slumping as Earnings approach he may take the first chance to dump it at break-even or better price.
Probably claiming the reason to Save the Earth from coin’s carbon footprint or something, maybe after some semi related tweet pumping in a plausibly-deniable way.

That would be good for Tesla, maybe. But most likely bad for both ‘coins price and Elon’s reputation.

Anyway, if ‘coins price goes down there is potential for some new Musk-related drama.

Meanwhile a student that went from a D to a B quadrupled its value.

The reason why the price is kept low is their bad profit margins, which deserves a whole DD post by itself. I’ll try to summarize.

Maxeon spun off from its parent company, Sunpower. Sunpower had a contract signed more than 10 years ago, where they had to buy polysilicone at a fixed price. Right now, this price from the contract is much higher than the market price, and the contract was transferred to Maxeon. So until the end of 2022, they basically have to pay triple or smth like that the market price of this material.

When adjusting for the losses caused by this contract, MAXN should be profitable. I’m planning to accumulate stock until 2022. When the burden of this out-of-market polysilicone contract phases out, they will probably shoot up.

What does it mean?  It means the economy as a relation to money stock, is shrinking.  The economy is not shrinking, we know.  It's not really growing either.  Kinda stagnant.  Money stock is growing incredibly and at unprecedented rates.   Fairly obvious.  This is the great MMT experiment.  

But what does it mean for asset valuations?  If the economy is shrinking to money stock, do earnings matter?  Earnings being the profit on the relatively shrinking economy.  Earnings are becoming less and less relevant.   Isn't it more about who controls the money stock?  If that's the case, isn't a casino mentality a better mindset than worrying about what few cents on the dollar X company made this quarter?  It is better to attempt to manipulate asset pricing to garner more share of the ever growing money stock, than it is to worry about earnings in an economy that is shrinking in relation. 

This chart shows no sign of reversing and we have no reason to believe it will.  If you want to see how clueless the Fed is about the situation, read this [article.](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2016/04/a-plodding-dollar-the-recent-decrease-in-the-velocity-of-money/?utm_source=series_page&utm_medium=related_content&utm_term=related_resources&utm_campaign=fredblog)  You don't need to read it all, just look at the date and the last sentence. 

Maybe some don't understand the importance of money stock.  Why does it matter?  Sure, the economy is shrinking relatively, but not nominally.  Why do more dollars, that are clearly not entering into this economy, matter?  They matter because money stock could also be called political power.  Especially in the US where buying politicians is legalized, money represents political capital.  

The economy has no power as it shrinks.  The economy is what the government taxes.  It too will shrink as a result.  The people who have the money are rising in power.  He who controls it, controls all.",,

The study tracked emissions upstream. So, when you burn gasoline in your car or natural gas in your house, the oil company that extracted it is considered ""responsible"" for the emissions. Because of this upstream tracing, the entire top 50 (listed on page 14) is coal and oil producers.

What's more, not all entities in the top 100 were corporations. For example, the number 1 spot is held by China's *entire coal industry as a whole*.

LifeMD appears to use unlicensed doctors to dispense OTC medications, has implemented an autoshipping/autobilling scheme, failed to honor guarantees, and put in place abusive telemarketing practices.  
So what does the stock do in response to this? Of course, it jumps 12%.

  
I understand your frustration on the general market OP, but perhaps I can defend the LFMD stock because of my personal DD and holding positions in the stock itself since April.  
The lawsuits are based on a short report by Culper Research, with claims that have unfounded evidence against LifeMD. The company have since issued statements to refute the claims, and additionally SUED the institution! 

  
The company itself posted spectacular earnings for Q1 recently, with revenue up 323% YOY, and have increased revenue guidance for AY2021. 

  
With LifeMD's fundamentals getting better, having good catalysts lining up (news of endorsement from celebrities Kate del Castillo and Bellamy Young, receiving grants, information of INSIDER BUYING, and institutional holdings increasing to 34%), and having the current consensus from 2 analyst of a 12-month PT of $37.50, it is IMO a reasonable justification for its performance in the past few days. Granted, I was also surprised by the huge jump in such a short frame of time, but nonetheless it is expected.

  
I do agree that this market seems to be more and more driven by ""memes"" and WSB gambles, but I believe that there are still good companies that will give back to their investors in the long run, regardless of the noise and the hype in the short-term

Got into trading last year, was unemployed, don't have trader tax status

So my question is regarding deducting a large capital loss last year against a large capital gain this year and if there is a 3k cap on that if i don't have trader tax status?

for example, if last year (2020), let's say i had 20k in capital loss from stocks. Now this year (2021), let's say i have 100k in capital gains.  CAn i deduct the full 20k capital loss from last year to this year's 100k capital loss, making my taxable capital gain income essentially 80k?   OR since i just a regular trader with no trader tax status with the IRS, i can only deduct 3k of that capital loss this each and the remainder carries over each year, making this year's taxable capital gain income 97k?

I'm reading online and there is so many conflicting info.  Some say that it's 3k max each year, and you will only be able to deduct 3k until you deduct the full capital loss through the years, every year.  Others say that only up to 3k of the 20k loss is deductible  if it is against ""Regular income"", but if you have a huge capital gain this year (like 100k in this example), you can deduct the full 20k for this year.

I know, before you guys say go to speak to an expert cpa and etc...yes yes i know, i will.. But i am still also wanting to hear advice or answer of anyone who's been in this situation before.

521,gyst7jo,2021-05-20 08:23:43,t1_gyst7jo,t3_ngcedr,stocks,"From first principles:

So first, there was stuff. Gourds, food, cool rocks, mountains, whatever. But there wasn't quite enough stuff for everybody at some point, and also fuck Steve, because Steve's a dick and he can't have any of these cool rocks I found or food from that cool tree I know about.

So, ownership isn't, like, an inherent physical trait of a thing. It's a matter of agreement, and frequently when this agreement can't be established, it's solved with pointy sticks/bioweapons/icbm's or whatever. It's cool; Steve was a dick and nobody misses him, and also he died back in the mists of prehistory and probably wasn't named that, but we don't respect him enough to think about it too hard.

From ownership we get trade, the transfer of ownership, the agreement that ""I used to own this and you now own this and for whatever reason , that changed without either of us stabbing/nuking one another"", probably because Steve wasn't involved, so if anyone says that thing is mine because they were out of town when we agreed, I'll correct em! Because I'm not Steve.

and from trade we get money, an abstraction a bunch of people agreed on, because bartering is fucking tedious. Like steve. But what *is* money? It's..  just another agreement, right? But this one is less about trust in your neighbors about what goes where, and more like a religion. But a religion about people. It's faith that people will still think the thing is cool tomorrow. For a while, some of the first money was just barter goods that everybody always wanted, like salt or something else that keeps well and is necessary for life. But those things Cary from place to place, so if I from my prairie hut try to trade with some desert nomads and they try to pay me in salt, I'm gonna be fucking pissed. So instead it was based on bullshit arbitrary things; lies a bunch of people bought into. Maybe that thing is shiny rocks, or the us government, or crappy math that draws more power than a mid sized nation. Whatever. But part of what makes a thing cool is other people liking it, right? So money is kind of also a popularity contest. And a religion. But it's convenient, so instead of getting rid of it we mostly just argue over which thing is cool instead of if this stuff is cool.

Stocks are... Okay so originally, they came with a percentage of the corporate income and stuff. But at some point that mostly stopped. Some stocks still pay dividends? But mostly not, and those are nothing compared to the potential profits from the natural churn, so most people don't really care. So it's mostly just money, but instead of dead ~~imperialist warlords and slavers~~ presidents, we get our favorite brands in the pieces of paper our numbers represent! Lowes! Nvidia! Enron! And also if you try to buy a pizza with it, it probably won't work.

So. At this point, the stock market is *a few* layers of abstraction outside of literally anything, right? And you've got a thousand kinds of money that can only buy other money. And you're just getting things against-

So yes it's a casino. It's literally just a casino. It's poker, not roulette, there's skill involved, but it's a casino. No value is being created, and it blows up every couple years and causes a recession.",,

Regardless of where they are at as companies they are popular, highly talked about momentum stocks. The trick is knowing when to sell. I have no loyalty to a stock and once it gets caught up in the hype and exuberance of the market I'm taking profit.

I bought GME at $10 and sold at an average of $200. I believed it was undervalued at $10 and fair value, given the turn around possibilities, was $40-$60 max. Once it ran past that I started to take profits and set stops.

I bought PLTR on DPO day for $9.50 and sold at $27, it's a long term stock and will have a good run but it ran too hot too fast as got way ahead of it's valuation. I bought in again recently. 

I bought RKT at $20 and sold at $34. It had consolidated at $20 for months but still had a lot of chatter about it. Once they accounted a special dividends it skyrocketed and I was out.

712,gyt3r61,2021-05-20 11:01:51,t1_gyt3r61,t3_ngcedr,stocks,"I can explain from the very uneducated and objective mind:

The market is a human creation. Not an autonomous network. It's an idea that was created and cultivated by the richest and most influential people in the world. All concepts and practices that are created or performed at designed to expand, sell and distribute the wealth of the world's richest.

Sometime in the past 40 years the market opened up to small traders, the average joe, and the middle class sunk their hungry teeth into what was being sold as ""part of the American dream"". This market helped expand the wealth of the world's even further.

The idea that small money can be successful in the stock market is entirely dependent on that small money developing an incredibly narcissistic view on finance. After all, the entire system was designed by narcissists and sociopaths.

It's like playing poker at a casino now. The house will always make money, and out of the 100 people being dealt cards, only 5 or 6 will walk away will full pockets. The system isn't objective, fair, regulated, unbiased, or 'on the level'. It's designed to exploit compassion, fair play, and cooperation.

And it's not a conspiracy. It's animal nature. There are so many people who want it this way they collectively work towards it without needing to have a spoken understanding. Greed is a sin for a reason. And no it's not because it's bad for society (altho it is). It's a sin because just like now, the rich tried to convince the poor that trying too hard to be like them is wrong or bad and will lead to self destruction. It's not self destruction. It's the rich trying to crush possible competition. Which again, is just animal nature.

The more you understand the nature of what people are in any walk of life, the more you understand why anything happens.",,

Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SPCE) (""Virgin Galactic"" or the ""Company""), a vertically integrated aerospace and space travel company, today confirmed that the next rocket-powered test flight of SpaceShipTwo Unity will be conducted on May 22, pending weather and technical checks. This follows the completion of a maintenance review of VMS Eve, the mothership jet aircraft designed to carry SpaceShipTwo to an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet.

""Following a detailed inspection and thorough analysis of our mothership, Eve, we have cleared our Spaceflight System for our upcoming flight. I want to thank our incredibly talented team of engineers, maintenance crew, quality inspectors and support staff for their diligence and hard work, which is testament to our commitment to safety and the integrity of our flight test program,"" said Michael Colglazier, Chief Executive Officer of Virgin Galactic.

Virgin Galactic regularly monitors its vehicles to verify their condition and inform timing of future upgrades and modifications that can improve performance or reduce future maintenance work. A post-flight inspection of VMS Eve in early May called for further engineering analysis to assess a known maintenance item in the tail of the vehicle, which was scheduled to be addressed during the next maintenance period. This analysis has been completed with the Company determining structures healthy, clearing Eve for flight.

The upcoming VSS Unity test flight will be crewed by two pilots and will carry research payloads as part of the NASA Flight Opportunities program. A key objective of the upcoming flight will be to test the remedial work that has been completed on VSS Unity to lower the EMI levels experienced on the December 12, 2020 flight when the onboard computer halted ignition of the rocket motor. The flight will also incorporate all original test objectives, including assessment of the upgraded horizontal stabilizers and flight controls during the boost phase of the flight, evaluating elements of the customer cabin, and testing the live stream capability from the spaceship to the ground.

Following this May flight, and in line with normal procedures, the team will complete an extensive data review, which will inform the next steps in the test flight program.

If you are long congrats. However if you are gonna tell me about their amazing tech & innovation fuck off!  UPST is just another overvalued, Ai, SaaS, Payment High-flyer who forgot it’s 2021 but IPO’ed late last year under the shadow of ABNB & DASH however just like the ladder two GOLDMAN is also their Godfather (took all 3 public) and GS takes care of it’s babies.  Compared to it’s more celebrated peers UPST was of to a slow start. IPO’ed at $20 (the low end of the range $20 - $24), hardly drew any buzz and post IPO sat around for a few days kinda lost. 

GOLDMAN TO THE RESCUE: Once Goldman shoved a stupidly high valuation which the market accepted for ABNB & DASH then it focused it’s attention on poor little UPST and started to drive interest for the shares (part of the GS starter kit when you select them to run your IPO which founders & round investors love.  They need to make sure to pump the price hard before lock-up expiration *THIS IS KEY.

RECAP: UPST, went public at $20 in Dec the week after the other two and once public had a $1.8 Billion valuation and already trading at a rich valuation (just earlier in 2020 it has been valued around $800MM).  

TODAY’s VALUATIONS: Fast forward; today UPST is valued over $10 Billion trading at a whopping $135 per share Est PE: 200X PS: 40X PB: 30X (regardless of future potential growth these are disgustingly high valuations) oh JUST OVER 40% OF THE SHARES ARE STILL LOCKED!  

TRADE / LOCKUP EXPIRATION / JULY: Lock you for UPST is scheduled for early July which will increase the float by 40% and this event will trigger pressure on the shares (round investors selling, in creasing the supply) and mixed with a higher interest rate environment and stupid high valuations WILL CUT THE CURRENT PRICE BY AT LEAST 50%. (You know very well every single 2020 high flyer was cut in half this year. UPST is no exception just delayed). 

PROOF:  Goldman was the investment bank for several other similar IPO’s and applied the same formula.  Check to procure movements, IPO, ramp up, expiration lockup followed by substantial decrease of share prices.  SNOW, DASH, ABNB, BIGC, FROG, PLTR.  

BY AUG THE PRICE WILL BE $50-$60 AND I’LL BE UP 200% ON MY SHORTS",,

MGM owns a major film library, with interests in the long-running James Bond franchise as well as other well-known titles such as Rocky and Pink Panther. It also owns the Epix cable channel and makes TV shows, including The Handmaid’s Tale and Fargo, and reality shows such as Shark Tank and Survivor. An acquisition would beef up Amazon’s film studio and streaming services Prime Video and IMDB. A deal could cost between $7 billion and $10 billion.

So from my basic understanding. The fraud dude will post a large buying order of stocks of X. This would be done through HFT algorithms to ensure a large order in a small amount of time, which will task the system a lot of processing time to deal with it. When the price goes up as a result, the fraud dude will cancel their buying order and sell whatever X stocks they've got at that price, making profit.

My questions are: 

* In what form is this Large buy order executed? Are we talking about a high number of consecutive micro buys, or a single big order of an insane number of stocks.
* If, it's a successsion of micro orders, what's the appropriate time interval, from the first fake order to the last, for this to be considered a Quote Stuffing attempt. e.i a 1000 orders in 2 seconds? Can the system detect orders from other traders in between the fraudulant orders?
* does the time of cancelling and amount of canceled orders matter? If so, how long would it take for the fraud dude to cancel, and how much would they have to cancel (100%, 80%, etc)?",nffv8t,I have a few questions about the idea of Quote Stuffing

Unpopular opinion part:

Thought experiment: Sure you can pay every worker out there 5$ per hour more - but what will happen? A dollar ""lives"" off of the difference a worker can achieve with it. Higher risk jobs will demand not just 5$ but an additional bonus on top for their riskier work until you end up with the same pay ratio as before. This takes ages however, which is why you can get away with it. Money can only work in a system with limited supply - as soon as you can create it from thin air it makes no sense.

It could be as simple as, ""Gold due to kick off major gains due to inflation fears.""  You then buy manipulated paper gold or gold stocks and they short it, make money when it goes down due to unlimited phony shares, people sell and they profit.

As far as efficient capital allocation and price discovery, that's an interesting, ongoint (and probably will be ever going) argument between active vs passive. In the end, both are necessary. Active investors subject themselves to alpha (both the good and bad side of alpha) while providing price discovery, and passive investors strengthen the beta and provide stability and steady inflows.

There were many ropes attached to the wrist but they were far enough away that No Single Person could control or coordinate them all because they were too far away - sometimes on opposite walls. 

You would think that with dozens of people just randomly pulling the ropes, the marionette would just move about jerkily. Instead this thing moved about gracefully - dancing with a mind of its own. 

Your comments about a Mega Bot made me think of this thing. That art piece was called The Corporate Mind because with a company being controlled by so many disparate managers in a market buffeted by so many external forces, how could we expected anything to be controlled how we expect it. At least that was my takeaway.",,

Who goes first is going to be whose broker has the best software and the fastest connection to the market.  If there are no buyers the market will instantly drop the 30% and everyone will get that price or probably lower in your scenario where everyone is selling at the exact same time.  A stop limit is the same concept but you set a limit on the sell in which case your sell order will not trigger and I guess you are bag holder as you are still holding the stock.  However in your scenario unless there was some huge accounting scandal like Enron, odds are the market orders will probably get a worse price as the stock will probably bounce back off the lows.  Essentially your scenario would cause a flash crash where the computers all started selling at the same time and eventually the buyers will see value and bring it back up (not all the way but above the lows all the market orders sold at)",,

Last week it was -1.52% but the average for the month +11%. 
Look at the line for the year if it’s going up more than it’s going down that’s good, if its going down more than it going up that’s a bad thing.

AAPL is worth $100. It drops down to $70 all of a sudden.

Stop loss: It triggers a market sell order when the stock drops below $95. Since it dropped so quickly and everyone's market order for a sell order is trying to activate.. your order might actually sell at the bottom of the dip. You've now sold the shares for $70 each. Or possibly, anywhere from $70 to $95.

Stop limit: It triggers a sell order for EXACTLY $95. Since the stock dropped to $70 so quickly, no one is interested in your sell order of $95 as everyone else is selling it for $70 - $71. Congrats you are now a bagholder as you still have the stock.",,

These things are not natural, they only happen if an earthquake destroys the factory, or the CEO dies in a plane crash...

Then you have the whole shady thing around GME and AMC.

Dark Pool trades of GME are around 50%. And inspite of repeated good news - debt free, new chairman, excellent, team, no debts, the stock just moves down or sideways.
