A common misconception that science continues at the same pace. You can't just ""*buy*"" inventions. You can't ""order"" a new technology that hasn't yet been invented. The last century was a great leap in innovation, all the electronics and computers and all other great things. But we may have reached a plateau - it may be temporary, it may be long term, but it's obvious to everyone who isn't afraid to open their eyes that the speed of innovation has slowed down considerably. Not to mention all the headwinds to our growth in the form of falling EROI and all the ecological problems.

Also despite AMD flashing good tech, they were never able to penetrate enterprise in the past. Athlon had major thermal issues. This time they did. In fact they are a big player in servers today. I find that my servers on GC running Ryzen outperform their Xeon counterparts dollar for dollar. This is bad news for Intel because their position in enterprise was thought to be unshakable.

Dont get me wrong, I think Intel can do a lot of things to get back on track. All I am saying is when investing, you should wait to see the plan first. There is really no rush. Its not like they are going to magically find new market share to grow exponentially in the next 5 years.",,

Amazon's main businesses are e-commerce (consumer facing) and AWS cloud services (business facing). Apple may get a ton of money from their iDevices, but they also bring in a lot of money from stuff like their app stores, and other hardware. A lot of businesses buy plenty of their devices to.

They’re well positioned to meet the impending rise in demand for battery grade lithium carbonate in terms of their Argentinian project. Production will begin in 2022, they have a partnership with Gangfeng for a large amount of the product (70%) to be bought at market price insuring the company will have a off supply. Gangfeng just made moves to open a lithium battery operation in the same town as the Argentina mine. LAC other operation is a bit more tenuous in terms of funding (they still need a major partner) but they have gotten a groundbreaking environmental document. I work in environmental regulations, the ROD they got for Thacker Pass puts them in a trajectory to meet the upcoming demand in 5-10 years. 

The lower price point should make it an easy stock to pick up, I’ll bet you’ll see a rise this year when they obtain their water rights and land rights for Thacker pass and in quarter one of 2022 when they announce production in Argentina. 

I’ve spent a good amount of time researching LAC, the lithium market, mining techniques as well as my background in environmental regulations.

no it isn't.  
  
>real unemployment is sky high  
  
What're you using for ""real unemployment""? U-6? Currently, U-6, which measures underemployment, is 10.4% and trending downwards. That's...where it was in 2015? And above 10.4% from July '08 until June '15. We've been above that for nearly an entire decade before.  
   
>stock valuations are completely bonkers trading several more times forward earnings than we historically have seen  
   
Huh? For some stocks, sure. Recent IPOs and memes like TSLA. But, could it simply be that companies are doing well? For example, nearly every one of the top 10 companies in the SP500 posted absolute monster years in 2020, record profits and revenue.   
   
> The market likes predictability, of which there is almost none present nowadays.  
  
The [VIX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EVIX/) exists to measure volatility, and while it's up 11% today, it's still down from a 52 week high of 36. Not like this is something we haven't seen.  
    
>it is a completely fair take to not see any end in sight  
  
You should take a deep breath and go outside, and I'm being honest. The CDC just removed the mask mandate for vaccinated persons. Unemployment is falling. Inflation, as of now, is exactly what we've expected. A short, transitory rise, followed by a flattening. We're in that rise right now, and it's not ""out of control"". We haven't even looked at raising interest rates as an option because we aren't concerned yet.  
   
There is absolutely an end in sight, this is a wild thing to say as a result of *checks notes* a 4% drop in the sp500 since an all-time high we literally hit on May 7 (which was just 12 days ago!!)

A gross oversimplification is that call option prices go up when the underlying goes up and put option prices go up when the underlying goes down. But that's ignoring theta, or time, decay as the option's expiration date gets closer and closer.

If I follow you correctly, it's impossible to answer because no one can predict the future with certainty.

* Estimate how many Tesla's you expect to be on the road in 2030. They are expecting 50% annual growth, with much higher growth in 2021 and 2022 and lower near the end of the decade.
* Estimate how many people will buy a FSD subscription if the software is truly autonomous and allows individuals and companies to deploy their Teslas as robotaxis for almost 1/10th the price of Uber/Lyft
* Multiply that number by $400 (conservative estimate for what an FSD subscription would cost when the software is perfect)
* Multiply that number by 12 for annual revenue
* Multiply that number by 0.9 for operating margins (almost pure margins)
* Multiply that number by 0.8 to get Net Income
* Multiply that number by a realistic PE multiple to get the Market Cap by 2030

I got to a market cap of $6,5T. Obviously this would only apply if they do solve full autonomy without anyone else solving it around the same time, but it goes to show how absolutely astronomic the market opportunity for autonomous driving software is.",,

Once full autonomy and robotaxis become reality, it will be a $4-8T market opportunity. Part of Tesla's valuation is the believe that they will capture a large part of this market. If they don't manage that, I do agree that it will take a while for them to start generating a return vs the current stock price.

That said, they still have a serious opportunity to generate high margin software sales even if they don't solve full autonomy. For example, they already make about $1000-1500 per car from software sales and they haven't even launched their app store yet. Meanwhile VW is spending billions to build a software system that delayed the ID3 release and then forced them to recall all ID3s because of more software issues, while it's earning them $0.

As for their production growth, they've already secured the factories to grow to 3-5 million cars per year and they're doing it at a much lower cost per installed production capacity than other automakers. There's still some opportunity just in their production expertise. Things like the way their factories are built, their material scientists, stamping presses, etc.",,

 SANTA CLARA, Calif., May 19, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [AMD](https://www.amd.com/) (NASDAQ: AMD) today announced that its Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program. Under this program, the company intends to repurchase up to $4 billion of outstanding AMD common stock. AMD expects to fund repurchases through cash generated from operations which have been strengthened by the company’s strong operational results.  


“Today’s announcement reflects our confidence in AMD’s business and the successful execution of our multi-year growth strategy,” said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD president and CEO. “Our strong financial results and growing cash generation enable us to invest in the business and begin returning capital to our shareholders.”

Under this program, which is designed to return value to AMD stockholders, offset dilution from stock issuances, and reduce share count over time, the company will repurchase stock in the open market. This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.",ngaugk,AMD Announces $4 Billion Share Repurchase Program

Gross merchandise volume was  $327 million , also up 27%. On a non-GAAP basis, the company lost  49 cents  a share, in line with the Street consensus.
For the second quarter, the company sees GMV about flat sequentially in the  $320 million  to  $330 million  range, but up 75% to 80% from a year earlier -- an easy comparison given the deep decline in the business during the pandemic last spring.

AMD servers are 80% of the existing same-specification server fee, freeing up high-performance computing resources at an affordable price for enterprise customers.
AMD servers can be applied to a variety of business applications, including the general web, middleware, as well as databases and big data analytics.
Existing systems can also be easily migrated to industry-standard x86 architectures, making them suitable for customers who need better performance for the price.  KT's self-validation shows that AMD servers perform at the same level as Intel server CPU cascades operating on the KT Cloud D1 platform. As a result, enterprise customers preparing for large-scale deployments are expected to significantly reduce their total cost of ownership (TCO) by utilizing AMD servers.  AMD servers are available on the D1 platform in the KT Cloud, which is more secure and flexible than regular public cloud zone. After launch, the company plans to continue to expand not only the D1 platform, but also kt G-Cloud and F-Cloud.  The D1 platform is built with physical security equipment such as IPS, firewalls, and VPNs for excellent security stability.  In addition, up to 15 DMZ and private networks can be flexibly created, and all network and firewall policies can be easily set up within the cloud console. In addition to servers of the same specifications as previous servers, they also offer high-spec servers with up to 128vCore x 256GB of memory.

Don't make investing choices on your consumer tastes. I buy from failing retailers all the time and I invest in stores with a good strategy that I'd never use.

The retail market, besides adjusting to E-commerce competitors, is also adjusting to shifting changes in income distribution int he country. Long term, we live in a society where 25-30% of society has more wealth than in the past and the bottom 70% has stagnant or wealth decreases.

This means retail markets are forced to adjust one way or another. They have to attract higher tier, but fewer shoppers (fewer locations) or they have to attract attract masses that are more budget conscious. 

They never made a large of a move into grocery super centers, as Wal-Mart did. However, they have made a large move into clothing, on top of their existing home goods. They've created a line up that is less like Wal-Mart, but competes better with cheaper clothes retails, such as Kohl's.

This is important, because they can grab market share from that 70% that can no longer afford to go to a typical Mall-based anchor or a specialty clothing store. However, they have to create better clothes and brand identities to attract them. This means they have some traction doing that.

That is partly why Mall chains and anchors, except for a few, have done so poorly. The business model is dependent on a stronger middle and lower-middle class. While e-commerce is certainly played a larger role, there are spots in the market for some retailers to take market share from others failing to adjust or unable to adjust to the new market.

&#x200B;

This same effect is why Bed Bath & Beyond is struggling, but higher tier stores with fewer locations, like Williams Sonoma are doing well. On the lower 70% of the market, Wal-Mart, Target, and Amazon are able to take market share from stores that use to cater in the middle of these two different price tiers.",,

They facilitate communication in anyway that companies would like to communicate with their users. SMS is 43% of revenue because that is their flagship product. They also have an email API (revenue from that grows by 30% a year) and people have been saying the same thing about email going away for 20 years. But you are missing the broader strategy, they are using their own infrastructure to fund the buildout of applications that will eventually provide a wholistic solution for enterprise companies. Flex uses all of their messaging APIs to bring support center infrastructure into the cloud. My prediction is that they will build or buy a CRM to facilitate sales communication with users. And to tie it all together they have Segment which will bring all of your communication data and usage data into a single warehouse. They have the infrastructure and will keep expanding both the API platform and services platforms with no end for their potential growth in sight.",,

All the time now, a company performs well and the stock price drops because of it. Take Lowe's today for example. It blasted earnings. It literally doubled them. 8th earnings in a row it has smashed, and today it's down. Literally, you have a company coining it in, and the share price is dropping. (I dont own it btw, so this isn't a rant on that basis)

I know the argument is ""ThE WhoLE MaRkEt Is DoWn"". Sorry, no, I don't buy this bullshit.

Let's look at todays winners;

Advaxis is the 2nd biggest gainer today and is up 21%. It's a garbage fucking pennystock that trades at 0.58 cents. Even worse, it's a bullshit pharma stock. Normal volume is 6 million. Volume today - 166 million. There is no news to justify this interest

Mosys is the big winner so far, up 33%. Another bullshit $5 stock. Normal volume is 2 mil. No news, but today the volume is 30x the norm.

LifeMD has had lawsuits filed against it today, about claims its directors have comitted fraud. Even better;

**LifeMD appears to use unlicensed doctors to dispense OTC medications, has implemented an autoshipping/autobilling scheme, failed to honor guarantees, and put in place abusive telemarketing practices.**

So what does the stock do in response to this? Of course, it jumps 12%.

To end my rant, the 3rd placed highest today is another bullshit company, a Chinese medical company called Lianluo Smart. There's one single news article linking it to a takeover by newegg or something, the news article made little sense. Low and behold, normal volume is 400k, today it's 9 million. Even if the news is to be believed, this one single article was posted 1 hour ago, yet the price suddenly spiked 2 hours ago.

So, why do companies that do well, make money, smash earnings lose their stock value, and bullshit, nonsense companies get P&D so much. This is a daily occurance. Every single day I see a new company increasing its share price by 50%+ and it's nonsense. I thought P&D's were illegal.

The problem IMO is deeply structural (inequality, etc.) and the pandemic just brought that out.  Trying to fix it by throwing buckets of money at it without much rhyme or reason, and with questionable political motives, IMO was not the solution.

I don't believe the doomsayers saying we're headed for Weimar Republic---that's a bit extreme and if it were the case, we're sort of screwed no matter what we do. No point to brood over that remote idea.

As far as blame is concerned, to place it on any one person is short-sighted. Keep in mind that a majority of the COVID stimulus, if one wanted to point to that as the impetus for excess inflation, was rolled out by the *previous* administration. And, keep in mind also, that no one at the time seemed to have a problem with it, because we were dealing with the type of crisis that we haven't confronted in over a century. Assigning blame is silly and ignores the fact that the position we find ourselves in is a hole we've dug since the 2000's.

We have people that don't want to trust a vaccine in the middle of a deadly pandemic. Tons of people are afraid of flying, even thought statistically it's far safer than driving. People want to feel in control, people don't trust technology (especially with their lives), and people especially don't want to trust stuff like AI, we have an entire movie subgenera dedicated to the idea of AI/robots rebelling and killing people. 

Aside from plenty of totally reasonable reasons to not buy a Tesla (can't afford a new car, want a feature Tesla doesn't offer, just prefer manual driving, want to access areas not well serviced by Tesla's charging network, want to take long road trips that would be hindered by Tesla's slow charge speeds, brand loyalty to other manufacturers, etc.) there are tons of less reasonable/rational reasons that people will be against autonomous driving because people are not rational creatures. 

>Even after other companies solve autonomy, there would still be some brand loyalty to Telsa, much like the brand loyalty to Apple.

Most people who are going to give their brand loyalty to a car brand already have, and the kind of deep running auto brand loyalty that is out there isn't going to be swayed to Tesla by getting FSD a few years before everyone else. Apple's brand loyalty isn't predicated on doing something first, it's predicated on the fact that Apple consistently produces products that merit it. Tesla has definitely generated some strong brand loyalty for itself over the past few years, but most people either don't hold strong brand loyalties, are already have a car brand that they're loyal too. 

>They might launch a robotaxi network. If they cannot scale fast enough they could lease the autonomous driving software to other companies as SaaS.

Which would still require Tesla's hardware, which in this scenario isn't being produced fast enough. Also, while SaaS is great for a company's bottom line, as a consumer it's a gross practice. I would never buy a vehicle that tries to exploit my wallet further through SaaS or subscription models, and I'll never understand why Tesla fanboys are so excited about this from a consumer perspective. 

>There is also there energy product, insurance, battery technology, and artificial intelligence innovations, which could have big potential.

All of which are predicated on Tesla's success with cars. 

>They have the most data, so they will probably be first to solve it

That's not how AI advancements work. Data is one component, but there is so much more. I keep seeing this line parroted around, but it simply isn't the case. There's no doubt that Tesla is *one of* the industry leaders in this area, but they aren't alone and their moat isn't as big as most people think. 

>The stock price has been so high recently because a lot of people are betting that they will solve it within 5 years.

If the bet is that we will have fully working FSD tech being relatively accessible in all 50 states with no more regulatory hurdles to clear by 2025 (seeing as Tesla's price took off in 2020), I wouldn't touch those odds with someone else's money. 


I'm not trying to shit too hard on Tesla here, I think they're an exciting company with a ton of future potential. However, many posts about Tesla's future are like this, where they hand wave away a lot of valid concerns, casually make assumptions that they probably shouldn't, and tend to seriously overstate Tesla's moat while underestimating their competition and the complexity of the problems that they're trying to solve, and just in general being overly optimistic to an unreasonable degree.",,

And because the sector is hot, they pushed good companies to overpriced territory too including Apple, MSFT, GOOG, Oracle, etc. I might make an exception for AMZN and we can also say that MSFT is fair due to safety but for the most part. We can also say stuff like NFLX, FB, QCOM, CSCO and a few others are probably fair priced.

For instance, PAVE calls itself an infrastructure ETF, but includes a bunch of railroad operators. Infrastructure to them is a cost and the thing they operate, not what they generate as a business. They're transport companies, so putting them in a builders group is mixing up concepts.

So I was looking at Exon, or another oil company, they had a great dividend, something like 7%, but the company had basically been staircasing down the charts. What do you make of that? As in, I can buy it but it feels like it's stagnating, the SP is moving down, and the div is likely holding that steady to some extent. Are you loading up? Or are you simply hawking waiting for the dip. I am building a div part of my ISA to hold long, but I'm just not sure what to make of it, sure I can get 7% dividend, but that's no good if the shares are worthless (unless I have massive piles of money, which I don't 🤔).

Given the hype around it and its 50%(was 100%) runup following IPO and how historically most IPOs crash within a year this puts it at what I view as a technical premium, regardless of any fundamentals behind it.

I don't really think that the peripherals market or ""gaming"" is a sector worth exploring due to what I presume to be low margins, slow growth and high competition, and while they do seem to offer components like RAM and PSUs I don't think that gives them a significant enough moat in the computing space. If I wanted to tackle computing and consumer hardware I'd prefer my money be in NVidia, AMD, or Microsoft as I think they have significantly better moats and the semiconductor industry is always booming.

Home improvement stocks have been rising for a while. Week after week of bull run up to the second earnings. This happened because people were expecting them to smash earnings. So when the news came that they did, profits were taken because in place of high expectations, there's no further momentum.

The hedge funds & institutional investors know that - they realize that reporting earnings is like blowing your load, all that excitement gets released & then the stock goes flat because people don't have anything to look forward to until the next earnings. This is why there's always a run up before earnings - or a run down when the expectation is the other way. It's about momentum.

But the trick is that, *because they know a profit taking is coming*, they're going to try and get out before other investors do. Buy low, sell high, right? That's what everyone's trying to do. Yet because everyone's trying to do it, it becomes a classic game theory problem. If you sell at the top first, you win. If the other guy sells at the top first, he wins. But if you sell too early, you lose. Same goes for him. So how do you ensure you sell first but not too early? Answer is - well, the answer is complicated because it involves all sorts of advanced mathematics involving Nash equilibrium equations, min-max optimization, etc. 

But at the end of the day, how it appears to your random retail trader who's got a college degree at best is that it seems totally random, or that it's all manipulated.

But that's only because you don't know the rules of the game. You can't see the mechanics. Sufficiently advanced technology looks like magic. Sufficiently advanced trading looks like bull ****.",,

> Tesla is going to lose market share. 

No one expects Tesla to maintain 80%+ market share for very long. Even ARK projects that Tesla will only be able to maintain about 25% of global market share in the long term. The point is that the EV sector will grow exponentially, so that anyone who survives the growth period will come out on top. I would rather Tesla be 25% of a $100 billion industry than to be 80% of a $100 million dollar industry.

As other have said long term investment/planning - these short term moves may not make since all the time (mainly I believe because we do not look far enough out)

Specifically to Lowes - Lumber appears it might be hitting a bubble (futures off 27% from highes); housing starts are way off due to high costs; Inflation concerns might lead to an interest rate hike - all of which leads to less spending on building materials going forward. SO while they had a report the future is looking pretty sketchy. 

ALSO keep in mind a lot of HD/Lowes spending is from people stuck at home last year. The money that was spent last year on renovations will be moved back to paying for travel and many are expecting it to be a big swing to travel to the point of taking the renovation businesses to point lower than pre-pandemic. 

As for the other companies you listed - sorry none of them would even be on my radar to invest in - call me to conservative - just too many good solid companies (long term) to look at.

Bottom line a lot of factors always at play AND most are not obvious or even revealed until it is too late for some investors.",,

Things were looking up from 2016-2020.  They had bought out their direct competitor and owned a majority share in Canadian Oilsands.  With Trump in office it looked as though the Keystone XL was going to be built which would be a new major route for the company to ship its oil. On top of this the Canadian government bought the Trans Mountain Pipeline from Kinder Morgan with hopes of expanding it to further increase the company's exports.  It had amazing growth potential.

That's simply not the case anymore.  Keystone XL is dead and Trans Mountain is in some very long term construction delays that means it won't be operational for at least a couple more years.  Worse yet Michigan is considering ending export permits for the Line 5 pipeline would mean severe cuts in sales to Ontario.

I'm sure Suncor will be worth a very short term gain coming up as the US economy starts rolling again (and right now it's at an insanely discounted price after a lot of dumping).  I think Berkshire Hathaway's divesting is more about what happens 5-10 years from now.",,

I refuse to follow the philosophy of generalizations: ""historically most IPOs crash within a year this puts it at what I view as a technical premium, regardless of any fundamentals behind it."" Not saying that you are wrong in that statement, but I prefer to base my decisions off the specifics of a company rather than a broad generalization. It's something to still consider, but should be a small factor in the decision process. 

I'm just going to sound like a salesperson for their products if I fully address your second point, but I will say that they will MAYBE expand their operations as they have historically done in the past by going into console controllers, prebuilt pcs/laptops, etc. I don't disagree that NVida, AMD, or Microsoft are bad investments. I think they are excellent investments for the long term, but I think Corsair still have significant room for growth with only a 3 billion market cap. Obviously there are other factors to consider, but I would like to keep the point concise unless there is something else you want to bring up.

Their financials are top tier with very conservative estimates for their earnings for next quarter. They've knocking it out of the park every quarter. I don't think with COVID receding that their sales will diminish at all. In fact, I think with people staying home from COVID has spread awareness about CRSR. With more people transitioning to working from home, their sales will probably continue to rise.

*Lack of debt* is most certainly a moat. If you are a legacy automaker and cannot pivot efficiently, then that is a huge handicap. Every dollar spent to repay bondholders and to pay dividends to shareholders is a dollar not spent on EV and battery research.

> Tesla is going to lose market share. 

No one expects Tesla to maintain 80%+ market share for very long. Even ARK projects that Tesla will only be able to maintain about 25% of global market share in the long term. The point is that the EV sector will grow exponentially, so that anyone who survives the growth period will come out on top. I would rather Tesla be 25% of a $100 billion industry than to be 80% of a $100 million dollar industry. Just like the industrial revolution of the early 1900s, only maybe 3 EV manufacturers will survive and they will share all of the profits. Tesla will be one of them of course.

> And Ford has a new salesman.

Ford also announced that they are cutting production by half next quarter, whereas Tesla's sales increased YoY despite the chip shortage. It is also telling that I can find neither the price nor the range of the F-150 Lightning anywhere on the Internet.

Concerning Lowes: A lot of time, investors will take profit on good news, and the price will come down temporarily. Also, the earnings (backwards looking) might mean a lot less than future guidance. The price of Loews has run up from 66 to 188 since the height of the pandemic. Sure enough, guidance from the CEO has made many investors question whether such strong sales trends can continue for Lowes as we exit the pandemic and labor costs increase.

I don't know why the other stocks have made runs, but there might be an answer. The answer might have to do with something technical, or a broader segment trend. At any rate, despite what people tell you, the market is not based on fundamentals. Fundamentals are a part of the equation, but if every stock was fairly priced all the time, there would never be any big gainers or losers. Think of it this way: There aren't enough analysts on earth to price every equity fairly based on fundamentals. They simply don't know.

Many new investors simply don't even know what valuations are, since they've been fed growth and hype since they started investing. 

A company can kill earnings and still be overvalued, a company can double earnings and still be overvalued  – just because a company is worth 100USD today doesn't mean it's worth 200USD tomorrow if it doubles its business.

It's brutally simple. The market is forward looking and unless something comes in like a curveball out of the blue; it's also pretty efficient  most of the time. That earnings beat has been priced in months ago. That new product has been priced in months ago. That sector rotation was priced in months ago. Once those new financials are confirmed, the smart money has already moved on, the people who gambled to squeeze the last few dollars are dumping, and only the people who never bother to look at other numbers than share price are holding the bag – only to sell low later and the cycle begins anew.

You can absolutely make good deals, but you do it when companies are out of favour and cheap, or, you buy the rumor and sell before the news. Other than that, longterm investing in solid companies and holding through ups and downs is the only way to go.",,

There is no fee, you wait tops 2 hours for your order to be ready and it always comes out under 5 minutes, even when it’s busy. I barely wait 3 minutes when I go. I’ve tried 3 other places where one of them (Hannaford - a grocery store) you have to pick a time slot and it’s always next day or 2 days depending on when you order, you have to call when you get there, and I’m always waiting 5-10 minutes. There is also a $5 fee unless you order over $200. 
Lowe’s I’m always waiting 10 minutes for someone to bring my stuff.
I don’t know, Target set the bar very high for me.  I love them.",,

You want to know what’s going on? In 2020, Citadel and other hedge funds, operating on unlimited credit from the Fed, decided to short a bunch of companies into bankruptcy. They did this so recklessly they severely overleveraged themselves. They also created a retail trading app that routes buy orders through dark pools, which they use to suppress and spike the price at will. 
 
Basically, the market is a sham, and it always has been — and especially since the pandemic, it is totally detached from reality. As for the mechanics of how that’s happening, well, some folks on other subs have discovered some very specific, undeniable evidence of market manipulation, which you should definitely read — unless you’re one of those people who thinks all short stock plays are a “meme scam,” in which case  I’ll see you in a month with another post wondering why the market’s fucking us over even more.",,
