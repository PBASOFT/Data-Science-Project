> ‚ÄúI think there will come a time when we can talk more about changing the parameters of monetary policy, **I don‚Äôt think we should do it when we‚Äôre still in the pandemic,‚Äù** Bullard said.

It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals¬Æ (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

¬∑ IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

¬∑ Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

¬∑ Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

¬∑ Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

¬∑ Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

¬∑ *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

¬∑ *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.‚Äù

It‚Äôs obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration ‚Äì Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION‚ÄôS EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here‚Äôs how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here‚Äôs how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) ‚Äì Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here‚Äôs how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, ‚ÄúManufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here‚Äôs how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) ‚Äì Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

First off, if you've been living under a rock and don't know what Alibaba is, here's a video about what the company does from CNN Business. [https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness)

Alibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 6 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I took notice when these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that environmentally sustainable (basically they just monitor their carbon footprint), something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yen (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, roughly 10% off it's 52 week low.

Now what REALLY turned my head was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO. For Munger, one of THE most risk-adverse investors in history, to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

Since Munger's position was revealed, Reddit users took notice and has become the most talked about undervalued stock on Reddit.

In short, there are times when investing seems easy. As Buffett says ""We simply attempt to be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.""",niwxaz,Buffet's Right Hand Man Buys $BABA. $BABA Becomes the Top Undervalued Stock to Buy Now on Reddit.
327,,2021-05-23 01:31:33,t3_nix3nq,,wallstreetbets,"This asshat started tolling on my post (my perspective): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i\_spy\_521\_recap\_and\_524\_outlook/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i_spy_521_recap_and_524_outlook/)

And then called me out in a post - without calling me out. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical\_analysis\_on\_smoothed\_moving\_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical_analysis_on_smoothed_moving_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3)

So id just like to give my perspective on what I'm seeing on the charts. Its all in the eye of the beholder so take it as a grain of salt. This TA has helped me make money and, I believe, gives me an edge. But to each his own. If you are making money with your own method then congratulations. Not gonna poo all over you if it doesn't align with my method and strategies.

From the [5/21 read post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhrou0/i_spy_521_read/)

A few things in TA my notes:

* called support and resistance levels.
* Called small moves
* Called that bulls need to break 418 and test 418 as support. As you can see we failed bulls.
* But bears did not break 414.
* Also called out a 20 SMMA test. Which we tested and failed.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/vhi7x1l5or071.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b7f89491be4eb7f6ab15b0c4e8149d803ada9f0)

From the spot gamma notes:

* look at abs gamma strike and look what was said.

I'd like to address this chart and comment:

""Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.""

[ To express what I see I'll provide my chart:](https://preview.redd.it/0ghkrgvhkr071.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99e69494648928d9891cb025a1da6b33f94835f)

Let's go back to the 20th first.

* 20 SMMA acted as support and was tested three times throughout the day on the 20th.
* The 20 SMMA would have played as a great indicator to BTFD for Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/1dnhk0s0lr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0dc044b41db5df168ee01cf164486e120281a5

Now lets focus on friday:

* Still have the 20 smma as support in the morning
* broke through 418 with blow-off top but failed to establish support.
* Tested 20 SMMA support at around 8 AM and failed but found support at top of gap (pretty common).
* Tested 20 SMMA as support at 9 AM but failed
* 20 SMMA now acted as resistance from about 9:15 - 11:30 (two fucking hours) Scalpers delight! Easily a 1x-3x bagger on an O'Hare.
* As you can see we bounced off the 120 SMMA and found support.
* The essentially consolidated for the rest of the day. ""*Consolidation* is the term for a *stock* or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. *Consolidated stocks* typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few *trading* opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

https://preview.redd.it/7y89c2awqr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=83d8c18d5dcf4bd08b12a1ac9e0cb00c0ee9d107

Taking this comment into account: ""Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen.""

Let's look at the RSI at the blow off top.  If you started buying O'Hare calls here then you belong in this sub.

TLDR - use basic ta for support and resistance. Use more than one indicator to confirm trends. Read my posts as conditional statements. If you have questions - ask - BUT don't be a dick. I provide bullish and bearish pts because like everyone else I don't know where the market is going to go in the future. SMMAs are a great tool but not good used by themselves. Use them to determine strength of trends IMO. Use them for shorting and buying opportunities off of bounces and rejections.

I had the revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector.  Increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I sobered up.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report.  However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  Many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.

They only count publicly tradeable shares for the market cap. This would bring UWMC's market cap down to an adjusted $830 M or so, which will significantly drop the weighting. From [this list](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/fund/1506575576011.ajax?fileType=csv&fileName=WSML_holdings&dataType=fund) of the iShares MSCI holdings, this will give UWMC a weighting of just **0.02%** rather than 0.16% as I had originally indicated. I am editing my OP below to reflect this correction. Apologies for not being diligent enough before writing this, and thanks to the additional diligence of those who pointed out the mistake!

One piece of news about United Wholesale Mortgage that has mostly gone under the radar is that UWMC will be included in the **MSCI World Small-Cap Index** starting on May 27. This has potential to be a significant catalyst next week, and I will lay out the reasons why here.

The list of new additions/deletions to this index can be found in the link to ‚ÄúMSCI Small Cap Indexes List of Additions/Deletions‚Äù on [this page](https://www.msci.com/index-review). UWMC appears on page 12 of this document as **‚ÄúUWM HLDGS A‚Äù**.

There is understandably some skepticism involved in regards to UWM and indexes after the fiasco with the Russell 1000 inclusion back in March. The blame for that mistake rests fully with FTSE Russell, as individual companies have no say on their inclusion or exclusion from the published lists. FTSE mistakenly added UWMC to the Q1 *preliminary* IPO addition list, and then later did not include it in the final list after realizing that by their own rules they do not include SPACs and a SPAC merger does not count as an IPO. But some key differences exist here with the MSCI Index.

First, the list published by MSCI is already the *final* list. It‚Äôs a done deal that UWMC will be in the MSCI index, it simply has to go into effect officially at the close of market on May 27. The other key difference, and **one which could potentially make this MSCI index inclusion a** ***~~meaningfully~~*** **~~greater catalyst~~** (update: not as significant as originally thought) than UWMC‚Äôs June inclusion in the Russell 1000 index (for real this time), is the fact that UWMC is being listed in the *small-cap index*.

Why is it beneficial for UWMC to go in the *small-cap* index? It has to do with relative weighting within the index. Companies are ranked and weighted based on their relative market cap sizes within the index. The higher ranked companies get a higher weighting and thus make up a relatively larger percentage of the index. For example, the top holding in the MSCI World Small Cap Index is CZR which has a weight of 0.23% of the index. This means that any funds that track this index would have to purchase enough shares of CZR such that the stock makes up 0.23% of the total assets of the fund.

~~So how is this bullish for UWMC? Because when UWMC is added to the index, it will likely be one of the~~ **~~top ten in ranking~~** ~~(or just outside the top ten) based on its current market cap.~~ [~~This page~~](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) ~~from BlackRock‚Äôs iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF shows the top ten ranked holdings. TPR is the 9th company in this list (top is cash) as of May 20, 2021, with a relative weighting of 0.16%. As of the close of market Friday, TPR has a market cap of just under $12 Billion. In comparison, UWMC closed Friday with a higher market cap of $12.95 Billion. So this means that upon official inclusion, UWMC should be ranked right around the 10th place position, which should~~ **~~give it a weighting of approximately 0.16%~~**~~.~~

**(Update: Free float adjustment gives UWMC a market cap of around $830 M, giving it approximately a 0.02% weighting in the index)** 

This allows us to then calculate the approximate number of shares of UWMC that funds tracking the MSCI World Small-Cap Index will need to purchase when it is officially added. I found three main ETFs that track this index. There are likely other funds, but these three are sufficient I believe to make the case for why this is a meaningful catalyst.

In comparison, when UWMC is added to the Russell 1000, it will be ranked right around 550th place based on its current market cap, giving it a weighting of 0.03%. It‚Äôs inclusion in the Russell will still be a positive thing, given that there are many more funds that track the Russell than the MSCI index. ~~But because of the 5.3x higher weighting that UWMC will have in the MSCI index, this gives its inclusion some significant OOMPH (legitimate financial term)~~ (update: not as much OOMPH as originally thought). [Studies have shown](https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion) that when a stock moves from the Russell 1000 down to the Russell 2000 due to a reduction in its market cap, the share price tends to move *up* shortly thereafter, because now it is one of the top companies in its respective index (with a higher respective weighting) rather than one of the smallest.

TL;DR: it is better to be a BIG fish in a ^(small) (cap) index than to be a small fish in a large index. Thus, I believe we can anticipate good things ahead with UWMC‚Äôs inclusion in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index.",nj0cj6,Detailed analysis on why UWMC‚Äôs addition to the MSCI World Small-Cap Index can be a significant catalyst

They supply semiconductor and display drivers to laptops, smartphones, tv's and cars. They also develop their own technology, such as a proprietary 3D Sensor technology for facial recognition used in security applications, and their WiseEye technology for motion detection in AI applications.

THE BASICS

$HIMX is one of the few stocks in the tech / semiconductor sector that offers Value & Growth, with a potential near term window for a short squeeze.

$HIMX is currently trading at $10.36 / share 

They crushed their last earnings report with an EPS of $.38 , outperforming their guidance of $.30 - $.34 . Their gross margin was 40%, also outperforming their 38% guidance.

[https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX\_1Q21\_Earnings\_PR\_Final.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX_1Q21_Earnings_PR_Final.pdf)

Additionally, their Q2 guidance is very positive. The are estimating at EPS of between $.54 and $.60 , and an even better gross margin of 45% - 47%

INSANLELY UNDERVALUED at $10.36 / share

If you can find a better value in the tech/semiconductor sector, let me know. But these numbers are getting to be a little insane.

The stock saw a pop up to $15/share after a pre-earnings announcement in April. But since then it's been the target of a short campaign, and been forced down by general market feelings toward the tech sector, as well as inflation fears. But look at these numbers:

Trailing P/E is 16.09

Forward P/E is 5.41

Market Cap is  $1.8 Billion

Trailing revenue is $1 billion 

Cash heavy with d $245.8 million in cash in Q1, and only $57 million in loan debt

This company has a healthy balance sheet, plenty of cash, and it's yearly revenue 55% of it's market cap.

Here's the thing. Institutional ownership is relatively low, which makes this stock an easy target for manipulation. As of this quarter, institutions own 19.25% of the company, but that's up from 12% from the previous quarter, with about $60 positive inflows from filings this quarter. These were all trades made in Q1 that were reported this quarter.

&#x200B;

But since their last earnings release earlier this month, the price has tanked. There's been insane Put volume, and it seems someone with a lot of buying power is manipulating this stock downward, perhaps in an attempt to exercise puts.

June 18th is particularly interesting. Take a look at Put open interest for June 18th. 41,664 OI on a $9/put.

There was similar Put interest this past week at the $10.50 strike price . . . and low and behold, the stock closed at $10.36 on this past Friday.

I'm no options expert, but I think it's clear we have some manipulation, perhaps with the intent to for MM's or hedges to drive price down and exercise cheap puts to pick this stock up even cheaper.

But how far can the stock get driven down?

There's a few things to take into consideration on the downside.

1. Taiwan Drought - Drought in Taiwan has effected chip industry. So far it hasn't effected Himax though, and the claim to have secured supply chain growth for the remaining of the year.
2. Taiwan Covid - There's been an outbreak of Covid cases. This could disrupt production, but  Taiwan seems to be working quick to curtail the issue. This is definitely an unknown at this point.
3. Past Fraud Allegations: in 2017 Citron Research accused Himax of providing false information on forward guidance statments. No official charges were levied though. [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/12/08/1250159/0/en/Himax-Technologies-Strongly-Denies-Citron-Research-Allegations-of-Fraud.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/12/08/1250159/0/en/Himax-Technologies-Strongly-Denies-Citron-Research-Allegations-of-Fraud.html)
4. Bollinger bands analysis suggest further downside to single digits before a rebound. THis is without future catalyst, or renewed interest in the stock [https://stockinvest.us/stock/HIMX](https://stockinvest.us/stock/HIMX)

Now, some recent Catalysts to the upside. 

1. A new product line of Phase Modulation platforms was released last week that could disrupt automotive/EV display technology  .

2.

3. DIVIDEND ANOUNCEMENT: Himax suspended dividends last year because of Covid, but many speculate a dividend is coming soon. Taiwan companies are incentivized to pay out dividends though very large tax breaks. A dividend announcement would surely bring in further institutional investors. 

So there you have it. This is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. Just a heads up that HIMX seems to have some short term short interest, but could be ready to kick off. I'll let you decide.",nj6x5e,"$HIMX DD , Value AND Growth in Tech sector??"

You can find the last week's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nds2vh/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/rc961bm4hv071.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4701a99fd4471a560552f895ebcc817e72e334d3

GME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \[Redacted\] as a payment option.

Newcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.¬†We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \[redacted\], a new \[redacted\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.

**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker‚Äôs Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it‚Äôs slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.

**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford‚Äôs CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

**DraftKings** is an American daily fantasy sports contest (dfs), sports betting operator (sportsbook), and virtual casino platform (igaming). Essentially it's a fucking money pit for retards who have gambling addictions, and according to a [Harvard Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230631/#:~:text=Based%20on%20its%20analysis%20of,activities%20in%20the%20past%20year) conducted in fucking 1997, approximately 1% of adults have gambling addictions, I'm sure with todays ease of access, it's more like 2%, so, \~6.6 million retards are at severe risk to giving DraftKings their bank accounts. Like I said, this shit is a money pit, they provide a service that results in LITERAL FREE MONEY. Instead of driving to a casino, these geniuses at DraftKings are allowing some individuals to gamble from the comfort of their couch, it's amazing. Also, when I say retards, take that lightly last Saturday, I gambled away, and streamed myself in an undisclosed off-brand WSB discord, $500 in an online casino, and gamble on sports, daily, hell, last NFL season I finished first in the r/sportsbook betting contest. [PROOF (i love gambling)](https://imgur.com/gallery/woD8Vpu). With that said, if you like something buy it, if you love something invest in it. I love gambling, and will invest in the BEST *legal* sports book out there, DKNG, aka Donkey Kong, aka Donkey Dick, aka Dick Kings. :kek:

**SWOT ANALYSIS of Dick Kings**

**STRENGTHS:**

* Industry leaders: currently DKNG is legal in more [states](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/help/sports-betting/where-is-sports-betting-legal?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2Fhelp%2Fsports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal&wpcn=help&wpscn=sports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal) than any other sportsbook platform, they're legal in 11, with 2 on the brink of legalization, and a window of opportunity by eoy for the remaining 11 states where it is legal.
* Marketing/Advertising: if you're a sports guy, you'll noticed DKNG is fucking everywhere, you cant escape it. They're all over social media and are on every fucking commercial.  They spent 77% OF THEIR [REVENUE ON MARKETING PLATFORMS LMAO](https://www.actionnetwork.com/legal-online-sports-betting/draftkings-reports-increased-revenue-marketing-2020-earnings).
* Partnerships: They currently have a partnership with the NFL, UFC, MLB, three [NBA teams](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/02/draftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F&wpcn=about&wpscn=news%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F), and they own a [Nascar](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2021/05/20/draftkings-joins-nascar-star-bubba-wallace-23xi-racing/). Not only that, but Disney (ESPN) has a 6% stake in their company, yeah the largest sports network in America owns a [6% stake of DKNG.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17950769) (dont fuck with the mouse). They also have upcoming partnerships with Dish Network, and I'm sure they have a fuck ton of other promotions on the way.
* Ease of access: you literally type it in the browser, or download an app. Deposit you wage cuck check through paypal or via debit card and within 1 hour your entire check could be gone, it's that easy.
* UI: You know how everyone says, ""oh don't use robinhood, it's bad, it's so cancer, they sell your data."" Shut the fuck up, you know that UI is fucking sexy and that's why you keep buying FDs that's the same shit with DKNG. I've used hundreds of online casinos and sportsbook, personally bovada is my go to, but for legal books, DraftKings is by far the best, no question. That platform is sexy, look how clean this is compared to fanduel.

**WEAKNESSES:**

* They care too much, and try to hard to make as much money as possible? wtf? you thought imma drop actual weaknesses, imma straight shill. No thanks LMAO. Fan Duel, Barstool sportsbook is straight trash. dafuq.

**OPPORTUNITIES:**

* State Legalizations, currently there are only 24 states where sportsbooks, igaming is legal, but it's expected to be legal nationwide in the next 1-3 years. Maryland, Nevada, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and New York are on the brink of having DKNG in their states. I know a few of those states legalize literally just last week.
* Partnerships, with the amount of money DraftKings is spending, they're going to have deals with the NHL, NBA and possibly even some college ball in the next few months. I wouldn't be surprised to see DKNG become the official sportsbook of the NFL in the future. I know a few [stadiums](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.giants.com/news/draftkings-and-new-york-giants-announce-official-exclusive-sports-betting-deal) offer DKNG sportsbook in stadium, and I think this will become the norm in the next few years. You'll be able to go to a ballpark, stadium and place your bet directly there right next to your $40 beer (cause inflation).
* Social Media. I think where it stands right now, if you google DraftKings, their social media platform is okay, but in the next few months, especially near NFL season, it'll absolutely explode. They obviously have a facebook, twitter accounts, instagram and they are extremely interactive, they have daily podcasts and shit, but that's all so new. Their accounts are all growing, and I know as their social media presence becomes established, their brand name will grow as well.
* Buyouts, again, as a I said above Disney has a 6% stake in DKNG, I wouldn't be surprised to see Disney too onto their ownership and possible even buyout Draft Kings, I mean, imagine that. Disney, ESPN and DraftKings, all under the same parent company. That would be insane. You don't see Barstool (Penn), or Fanduel with that kind of opportunity.
* Igaming, I think this platform is so slept on. Virtual casinos are the fucking future, let me tell you, I've been doing this shit for years and once you legal bros get into this shit, you'll be hooked. There's absolutely nothing better than sitting your fat ass on the couch and blowing through hundreds of dollars betting martingale on black 7 times in a row. SHIT IS FUCKING GREAT. If they can develop a strong Igaming presence, they'll be loaded. Igaming is \~$[250 billion industry](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/gaming-market-2020-2025-size-share-trends-growth-value-and-research-report-2021-03-03?tesla=y#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,Mobile)

**THREATS:**

* Their only threat is competition, which is actually a strength because their competition is dog water. Barstool Sports can't get a partnership with the largest revenue sport, the NFL, because the NFL commish Roger Goodell absolutely hates the face of Barstool, aka Portnoy. I love Portnoy, but guy is a week away from some fucked up-cocaine induced canceling, I'm telling you. Barstool will entertain the stoolies, but they'll never become the Mcdonalds of fastfood, they'll always be the fucking nasty ass trash Burger King that you have to go to because the Mcdonalds line is too long. Fanduel is owned by a UK company, what do they know about American sports. WHAT COMPETITION.

Their revenue has absolutely gone bananas in Q1, which is fucking insane, because there were some rumors that DKNG lost a fuck ton of money from the [superbowl](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nhbr.com/the-brady-effect-new-hampshire-lottery-sacked-in-super-bowl-betting/#:~:text=State%20takes%20a%20%243%20million,the%20Bucs%20and%20their%20QB&text=While%20New%20Englanders%20bet%20heavily,hole%20on%20Super%20Bowl%20Sunday). Anyway, as you can see their revenue grew a dick-ton. The big scary here is their net is horrible, why, the big no no? Sales and Marketing. I was worried about that too, but that's their game plan, to a spend a fuck ton of money to game market dominance early on, retention rate is key to this industry. Jason Robbins their CEO said it on a [podcast the other day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93aGVyZXRoZW1vbmV5aXMubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/Nzg3ZDM1Y2QtMTgxYS00ODBhLTllZGMtMzFmZDdlNWNlMTIx?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwisjdvGtt7wAhWKUt8KHVAoCCkQjrkEegQIBBAI&ep=6), they're in preseason, training camp in this market. They're still warming up to the full opportunity.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/draftkings-reports-first-quarter-2021-results-and-raises-2021](https://preview.redd.it/4w1istie3w071.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=6116ae4857dac73c83688feb1796471896cdaac8)

So to touch upon their spending again, as you can see their spending is working. They gained new degens at a rate of 114% compared to the first quarter of 2020. INSANE GROWTH. They're growing and retaining rates at a crazy level.

[more good. less bad.](https://preview.redd.it/ezqljieg3w071.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=690df56ebd62a93b9ec73feaad69223f02f07997)

tl;dr REVENUE PUMP. They're expected to blow revenue out of the water, shit is going full parabolic. Raising revenue guidance to $1.15 billion,

DKNG only has access to 25% of the U.S. population as of right now, and the stock is at what $45, what till this shit nation wide.

DKNG is sitting pretty right above their low price target at $42.00, and you aint buying? Look at these price targets, a ceiling of $105.

Look at the dates of filing and values. A lot of the media is shitting on Cathie Woods for buying DKNG religiously, but nobody is shitting on BlackRock for owning over 8million shares. As a wise man once told man, BlackRock is the United States testicles, they are the balls of this country. If they buy something, you know that shit is going to cum to the moon. It's insane how many of these big names are buying right now.

**Technical Analysis** so I hate to be the guy, but this is the [only stock I've traded all year](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/).

SHORT TERM(1-3 months):

[wedge, no vol.](https://preview.redd.it/ueoiofxw3w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=0806df6ce5521a17081b3a632be2b02361c355e4)

As you can see from the chart above, we're currently trading in between the 7d sma and 50d sma on the 2hr. This is most likely complete confirmation bias, but I backed tested when DKNG has a daily closed inbetween this same crunch since it drooped the spac name, and whenever it has this same set up, these are the next day, and or two day returns.

02/10 +10.48% , 03/04 +13.89% , 03/25 +1.62% , 07/16 +9.46% , 09/09 +9.11% , 11/05 +9.05% , 1/08/21 +4.48% ,3/10/21 +11.48% , 04/26/21 +1.91%

Try it yourself. This is actually the reason why I bought weeklies eod friday. Check my positions at the top. I think in the next few weeks, DKNG will go to that top level resistance line at \~49.5, and then it could trade sideways for a bit longer to fill that volume gap from 44.5 to 49.5, but I do think a pump day is coming nonetheless.

&#x200B;

LONG TERM(3-12 months):

[Support \/ Meme Line](https://preview.redd.it/014ln9o04w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=845d45afafea0c86a25b60729e5039fb328d1c45)

So, longterm (3-12 month window), referring to the chart at the top, it looks like DKNG has found support off the 35.5 bottom it hit in September, there's massive volume support at the 42.5 line, and that looks to be the new floor (god forbid a market crash happens soon, plz no fomc june 18th taper tantrum). It looks like the next major test for DKNG is at the 200d SMA or 51.52. If you look at RSI, it's leaving oversold territory, and MACD is flashing a reversal. I think we're due for a next wave of highs on DKNG. I could see this popping to \~49.5-51.5 -> \~60 -> all time highs. TA is looking dumb bullish you fucking idiots. Buy this shit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**CONCLUSION**

in conclusion, I fucking love the stock. Technical and Fundamentals showing a strong buy. Dick Kings is about to cum, and be sure you're there to catch the cum, because once this thing is near it's edge, it's going to absolute nut. I know I wont want to miss suc.. am I gay? anyway. buy dkng.

It's rather shocking to me that most people have never heard of ImmunityBio - IBRX in the biotech space.  They have this new drug called Anktiva could be a new cancer drug for a wide range of cancers. Not just one type but looks to be for mutliple types of cancers based on the study.  Seems like the side-effects are minimal.  Only downside I see from the study is that it's only a phase 2 trial of 140 patients so it's not as wide-ranging as a phase 3 study.  Although, Anktiva got a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in another phase 3 study.  So FDA approval could be on the horizon since a phase 3 was done for bladder cancer. 

But apparently according to the phase 2 study, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. . Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda).  Could be hope for those who have failed previous treatments for various solid tumors.   If you know of anyone that has cancer and has failed or is failing treatment(s), I would call up IBRX and try to get in a study.

I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I've consumed lately.
&nbsp;


##Let‚Äôs start with a look at overall market performance by sector

I like to use this to establish a point of reference - _what_ kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly?

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/cV2n4du)

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD](https://imgur.com/LrgETAx)

I‚Äôm using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that‚Äôs a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year‚Äôs growth trade has lagged and given back.

##Now let‚Äôs look at index performance:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/eaDWp9s)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/iGGKKee)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/57uD3Ue)

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.   
**Take-Aways**  

- Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce, seemingly fueled by panic-buying at the Thursday open.  
- The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces; for SPY the 50DMA has held, QQQ support at 316.  
- Despite the recent volatility, we have no had a significant drawdown; we're still close to ATHs on these indices, and specifically I look at QQQ's chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year.
- IWM appears to have formed a range, which I‚Äôd say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March. This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value (shown below) that started around this time. This chart is something to watch - if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run. 

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected ETFs 1y](https://imgur.com/kkdbTmk)

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

**Conjecture**  

- You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop: we‚Äôve held some established support and bounced nicely so hard to see us really breaking down further, alternatively we‚Äôve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between, which could be a sign of weakening  and indication of possible further downside.
- Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets. With the growing proliferation of the latter, we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on/with equities (or other) markets. If a bubble is bursting here, does it signal a growing risk-off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well? 


##Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year

I'm just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading; this is what I have in mind _right now_, but all of this can change in an instant of course: 

**Summer -** expecting the reflation trade (financials, energy, industrials, value) to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform.

**June FOMC -** There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here‚Ä¶ or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting.

**August Jackson Hole Meetup -** If we haven‚Äôt heard anything regarding tapering prior, speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change, as that‚Äôs what happened last year with inflation targeting. With fear of a taper tantrum, we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this.

**Late Summer -** If we haven‚Äôt had one by now, I‚Äôd expect a meaningful (10%) pullback. 

**Inflation Data -** June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes, but if we continue to get high prints into July, August, and later this year, inflation will become a real issue.

**Fall -** We start to get murky here. I‚Äôd look for a late-year rally to follow any pullback, but it‚Äôs hard to say; too many unknowns. 

**EOY Targets -** CNBC‚Äôs median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800. Consider we‚Äôre already +11%, +%12, +4% YTD on SPY, IWM, and QQQ respectively, and +86%, +119%, +92% since the March 2020 lows, is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near-term?

**Considerations**
- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Consider seasonality. We‚Äôre entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It‚Äôs something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- Have long exposure, but be careful with positioning and time horizons. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit, but there is no way you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&nbsp;

I think right now if you‚Äôre long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them. 

## Bonus Charts

**Commodities Performance**

I thought it would be interesting to look at the recent performance of certain commodities in comparison with major indices:

[Select Commodities vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/fRAUEyt)

[Select Commodities ETFs vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/jH48XtQ)

Lumber‚Äôs performance slightly skews the first chart, but in both we can see well enough that a divergence starting to occur in early-mid April - something to continue to watch as it‚Äôs a correlation with the inflation narrative but more specifically the supply chain issues we‚Äôve had. 

**Comparing Recent and (Recently) Historical Index Performance**

When considering the EOY Target data and the recent performance of equities, I thought it would be interesting to scale back a little further and do some historical comparisons:

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I‚Äôm big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I‚Äôve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I‚Äôve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE‚Äôs float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE‚Äôs 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled ‚ÄúHindenburg MVIS‚Äù and the second article that popped up was titled ‚ÄúTechnically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.‚Äù This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE‚Äôs pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg‚Äôs attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM‚Äôs investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that ‚ÄúTimeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.‚Äù

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio‚Äôs Endorsement of LMC:** üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn‚Äôt mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it ‚Äú‚Äòbull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don‚Äôt get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.‚Äù

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): ‚ÄúI think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area ‚Äî Voltage Valley as we like to call it ‚Äî but all over Ohio.‚Äù

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) ‚ÄúReally, this is the future,‚Äù DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. ‚ÄúI think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.‚Äù

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he‚Äôs visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he‚Äôs seen the company‚Äôs robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he‚Äôs seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre way way way far along,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.‚Äù

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE‚ÄôS**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced ‚ÄúLordstown Week‚Äù](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.

* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you‚Äôd be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I‚Äôm planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20‚Äôs. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

[$UWMC 20 Day 2 Hour](https://preview.redd.it/titkhs0fmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=142a5763bf0da2864af7776d8e7cdb488607f00a)

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

355,,2021-05-23 21:04:15,t3_njh8a7,,wallstreetbets,"Money¬†is used as a¬†medium of exchange, and as a¬†store of value.

In money supply statistics, central bank money is¬†MB¬†while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3¬†components. Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of¬†M1,¬†while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as¬†M2¬†and¬†M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of¬†currency in circulation¬†and¬†checking account¬†balances.
M2: M1 + most¬†savings accounts,¬†money market accounts, retail¬†money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit¬†of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other¬†CDs¬†(large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of¬†eurodollars¬†and¬†repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 +¬†Commercial Paper
M4: M4- +¬†T-Bills¬†(or M3 + Commercial Paper +¬†T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States¬†Federal Reserve¬†published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people‚Äôs saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People‚Äôs deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

356,,2021-05-23 21:05:18,t3_njh97r,,wallstreetbets,"Alright retards, I'm in here with a little bit of weekend DD. ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.
357,,2021-05-23 22:13:52,t3_njipr1,,wallstreetbets,"Liquified natural gas, LNG, is one of the world's fastest growing fuel sources. Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

I believe that with the back drop of a very positive earnings report, raised guidance, and a non dilutive secondary offering that there is significant catalyst to propel PRPL back to the mid to high 30's and potentially all time high of low 40s. I expect a steep climb over the next few weeks.

Just a regular investor trying to figure out the value of KT Corporation. I am currently long via shares and July 2021 12.50 and 15.00 call options.

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth?

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding.

366,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals¬Æ (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

¬∑ IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

¬∑ Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

¬∑ Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

¬∑ Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

¬∑ Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

¬∑ *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

¬∑ *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.‚Äù

It‚Äôs obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration ‚Äì Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION‚ÄôS EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage.

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, ‚ÄúManufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

First off, if you've been living under a rock and don't know what Alibaba is, here's a video about what the company does from CNN Business. [https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness)

Alibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 6 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I took notice when these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that environmentally sustainable (basically they just monitor their carbon footprint), something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yen (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, roughly 10% off it's 52 week low.

Now what REALLY turned my head was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO. For Munger, one of THE most risk-adverse investors in history, to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

Since Munger's position was revealed, Reddit users took notice and has become the most talked about undervalued stock on Reddit.

In short, there are times when investing seems easy. As Buffett says ""We simply attempt to be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.""",niwxaz,Buffet's Right Hand Man Buys $BABA. $BABA Becomes the Top Undervalued Stock to Buy Now on Reddit.
746,,2021-05-23 01:31:33,t3_nix3nq,,wallstreetbets,"This asshat started tolling on my post (my perspective): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i\_spy\_521\_recap\_and\_524\_outlook/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i_spy_521_recap_and_524_outlook/)

And then called me out in a post - without calling me out. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical\_analysis\_on\_smoothed\_moving\_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical_analysis_on_smoothed_moving_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3)

So id just like to give my perspective on what I'm seeing on the charts. Its all in the eye of the beholder so take it as a grain of salt. This TA has helped me make money and, I believe, gives me an edge. But to each his own. If you are making money with your own method then congratulations. Not gonna poo all over you if it doesn't align with my method and strategies.

From the [5/21 read post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhrou0/i_spy_521_read/)

A few things in TA my notes:

* called support and resistance levels.
* Called small moves
* Called that bulls need to break 418 and test 418 as support. As you can see we failed bulls.
* But bears did not break 414.
* Also called out a 20 SMMA test. Which we tested and failed.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/vhi7x1l5or071.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b7f89491be4eb7f6ab15b0c4e8149d803ada9f0)

From the spot gamma notes:

* look at abs gamma strike and look what was said.

I'd like to address this chart and comment:

""Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.""

[ To express what I see I'll provide my chart:](https://preview.redd.it/0ghkrgvhkr071.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99e69494648928d9891cb025a1da6b33f94835f)

Let's go back to the 20th first.

* 20 SMMA acted as support and was tested three times throughout the day on the 20th.
* The 20 SMMA would have played as a great indicator to BTFD for Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/1dnhk0s0lr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0dc044b41db5df168ee01cf164486e120281a5

Now lets focus on friday:

* Still have the 20 smma as support in the morning
* broke through 418 with blow-off top but failed to establish support.
* Tested 20 SMMA support at around 8 AM and failed but found support at top of gap (pretty common).
* Tested 20 SMMA as support at 9 AM but failed
* 20 SMMA now acted as resistance from about 9:15 - 11:30 (two fucking hours) Scalpers delight! Easily a 1x-3x bagger on an O'Hare.
* As you can see we bounced off the 120 SMMA and found support.
* The essentially consolidated for the rest of the day. ""*Consolidation* is the term for a *stock* or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. *Consolidated stocks* typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few *trading* opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

https://preview.redd.it/7y89c2awqr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=83d8c18d5dcf4bd08b12a1ac9e0cb00c0ee9d107

Taking this comment into account: ""Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen.""

Let's look at the RSI at the blow off top.  If you started buying O'Hare calls here then you belong in this sub.

TLDR - use basic ta for support and resistance. Use more than one indicator to confirm trends. Read my posts as conditional statements. If you have questions - ask - BUT don't be a dick. I provide bullish and bearish pts because like everyone else I don't know where the market is going to go in the future. SMMAs are a great tool but not good used by themselves. Use them to determine strength of trends IMO. Use them for shorting and buying opportunities off of bounces and rejections.

I had the revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector.  Increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I sobered up.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report.  However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  Many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.

They only count publicly tradeable shares for the market cap. This would bring UWMC's market cap down to an adjusted $830 M or so, which will significantly drop the weighting. From [this list](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/fund/1506575576011.ajax?fileType=csv&fileName=WSML_holdings&dataType=fund) of the iShares MSCI holdings, this will give UWMC a weighting of just **0.02%** rather than 0.16% as I had originally indicated. I am editing my OP below to reflect this correction. Apologies for not being diligent enough before writing this, and thanks to the additional diligence of those who pointed out the mistake!

One piece of news about United Wholesale Mortgage that has mostly gone under the radar is that UWMC will be included in the **MSCI World Small-Cap Index** starting on May 27. This has potential to be a significant catalyst next week, and I will lay out the reasons why here.

The list of new additions/deletions to this index can be found in the link to ‚ÄúMSCI Small Cap Indexes List of Additions/Deletions‚Äù on [this page](https://www.msci.com/index-review). UWMC appears on page 12 of this document as **‚ÄúUWM HLDGS A‚Äù**.

There is understandably some skepticism involved in regards to UWM and indexes after the fiasco with the Russell 1000 inclusion back in March. The blame for that mistake rests fully with FTSE Russell, as individual companies have no say on their inclusion or exclusion from the published lists. FTSE mistakenly added UWMC to the Q1 *preliminary* IPO addition list, and then later did not include it in the final list after realizing that by their own rules they do not include SPACs and a SPAC merger does not count as an IPO. But some key differences exist here with the MSCI Index.

First, the list published by MSCI is already the *final* list. It‚Äôs a done deal that UWMC will be in the MSCI index, it simply has to go into effect officially at the close of market on May 27. The other key difference, and **one which could potentially make this MSCI index inclusion a** ***~~meaningfully~~*** **~~greater catalyst~~** (update: not as significant as originally thought) than UWMC‚Äôs June inclusion in the Russell 1000 index (for real this time), is the fact that UWMC is being listed in the *small-cap index*.

Why is it beneficial for UWMC to go in the *small-cap* index? It has to do with relative weighting within the index. Companies are ranked and weighted based on their relative market cap sizes within the index. The higher ranked companies get a higher weighting and thus make up a relatively larger percentage of the index. For example, the top holding in the MSCI World Small Cap Index is CZR which has a weight of 0.23% of the index. This means that any funds that track this index would have to purchase enough shares of CZR such that the stock makes up 0.23% of the total assets of the fund.

~~So how is this bullish for UWMC? Because when UWMC is added to the index, it will likely be one of the~~ **~~top ten in ranking~~** ~~(or just outside the top ten) based on its current market cap.~~ [~~This page~~](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) ~~from BlackRock‚Äôs iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF shows the top ten ranked holdings. TPR is the 9th company in this list (top is cash) as of May 20, 2021, with a relative weighting of 0.16%. As of the close of market Friday, TPR has a market cap of just under $12 Billion. In comparison, UWMC closed Friday with a higher market cap of $12.95 Billion. So this means that upon official inclusion, UWMC should be ranked right around the 10th place position, which should~~ **~~give it a weighting of approximately 0.16%~~**~~.~~

**(Update: Free float adjustment gives UWMC a market cap of around $830 M, giving it approximately a 0.02% weighting in the index)** 

This allows us to then calculate the approximate number of shares of UWMC that funds tracking the MSCI World Small-Cap Index will need to purchase when it is officially added. I found three main ETFs that track this index. There are likely other funds, but these three are sufficient I believe to make the case for why this is a meaningful catalyst.

In comparison, when UWMC is added to the Russell 1000, it will be ranked right around 550th place based on its current market cap, giving it a weighting of 0.03%. It‚Äôs inclusion in the Russell will still be a positive thing, given that there are many more funds that track the Russell than the MSCI index. ~~But because of the 5.3x higher weighting that UWMC will have in the MSCI index, this gives its inclusion some significant OOMPH (legitimate financial term)~~ (update: not as much OOMPH as originally thought). [Studies have shown](https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion) that when a stock moves from the Russell 1000 down to the Russell 2000 due to a reduction in its market cap, the share price tends to move *up* shortly thereafter, because now it is one of the top companies in its respective index (with a higher respective weighting) rather than one of the smallest.

TL;DR: it is better to be a BIG fish in a ^(small) (cap) index than to be a small fish in a large index. Thus, I believe we can anticipate good things ahead with UWMC‚Äôs inclusion in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index.",nj0cj6,Detailed analysis on why UWMC‚Äôs addition to the MSCI World Small-Cap Index can be a significant catalyst

They supply semiconductor and display drivers to laptops, smartphones, tv's and cars. They also develop their own technology, such as a proprietary 3D Sensor technology for facial recognition used in security applications, and their WiseEye technology for motion detection in AI applications.

THE BASICS

$HIMX is one of the few stocks in the tech / semiconductor sector that offers Value & Growth, with a potential near term window for a short squeeze.

$HIMX is currently trading at $10.36 / share 

They crushed their last earnings report with an EPS of $.38 , outperforming their guidance of $.30 - $.34 . Their gross margin was 40%, also outperforming their 38% guidance.

[https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX\_1Q21\_Earnings\_PR\_Final.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX_1Q21_Earnings_PR_Final.pdf)

Additionally, their Q2 guidance is very positive. The are estimating at EPS of between $.54 and $.60 , and an even better gross margin of 45% - 47%

INSANLELY UNDERVALUED at $10.36 / share

If you can find a better value in the tech/semiconductor sector, let me know. But these numbers are getting to be a little insane.

The stock saw a pop up to $15/share after a pre-earnings announcement in April. But since then it's been the target of a short campaign, and been forced down by general market feelings toward the tech sector, as well as inflation fears. But look at these numbers:

Trailing P/E is 16.09

Forward P/E is 5.41

Market Cap is  $1.8 Billion

Trailing revenue is $1 billion 

Cash heavy with d $245.8 million in cash in Q1, and only $57 million in loan debt

This company has a healthy balance sheet, plenty of cash, and it's yearly revenue 55% of it's market cap.

Here's the thing. Institutional ownership is relatively low, which makes this stock an easy target for manipulation. As of this quarter, institutions own 19.25% of the company, but that's up from 12% from the previous quarter, with about $60 positive inflows from filings this quarter. These were all trades made in Q1 that were reported this quarter.

&#x200B;

But since their last earnings release earlier this month, the price has tanked. There's been insane Put volume, and it seems someone with a lot of buying power is manipulating this stock downward, perhaps in an attempt to exercise puts.

June 18th is particularly interesting. Take a look at Put open interest for June 18th. 41,664 OI on a $9/put.

There was similar Put interest this past week at the $10.50 strike price . . . and low and behold, the stock closed at $10.36 on this past Friday.

I'm no options expert, but I think it's clear we have some manipulation, perhaps with the intent to for MM's or hedges to drive price down and exercise cheap puts to pick this stock up even cheaper.

But how far can the stock get driven down?

There's a few things to take into consideration on the downside.

1. Taiwan Drought - Drought in Taiwan has effected chip industry. So far it hasn't effected Himax though, and the claim to have secured supply chain growth for the remaining of the year.
2. Taiwan Covid - There's been an outbreak of Covid cases. This could disrupt production, but  Taiwan seems to be working quick to curtail the issue. This is definitely an unknown at this point.
3. Past Fraud Allegations: in 2017 Citron Research accused Himax of providing false information on forward guidance statments. No official charges were levied though. [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/12/08/1250159/0/en/Himax-Technologies-Strongly-Denies-Citron-Research-Allegations-of-Fraud.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/12/08/1250159/0/en/Himax-Technologies-Strongly-Denies-Citron-Research-Allegations-of-Fraud.html)
4. Bollinger bands analysis suggest further downside to single digits before a rebound. THis is without future catalyst, or renewed interest in the stock [https://stockinvest.us/stock/HIMX](https://stockinvest.us/stock/HIMX)

Now, some recent Catalysts to the upside. 

1. A new product line of Phase Modulation platforms was released last week that could disrupt automotive/EV display technology  .

2.

3. DIVIDEND ANOUNCEMENT: Himax suspended dividends last year because of Covid, but many speculate a dividend is coming soon. Taiwan companies are incentivized to pay out dividends though very large tax breaks. A dividend announcement would surely bring in further institutional investors. 

So there you have it. This is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. Just a heads up that HIMX seems to have some short term short interest, but could be ready to kick off. I'll let you decide.",nj6x5e,"$HIMX DD , Value AND Growth in Tech sector??"

You can find the last week's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nds2vh/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/rc961bm4hv071.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4701a99fd4471a560552f895ebcc817e72e334d3

GME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \[Redacted\] as a payment option.

Newcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.¬†We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \[redacted\], a new \[redacted\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.

**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker‚Äôs Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it‚Äôs slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.

**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford‚Äôs CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

**DraftKings** is an American daily fantasy sports contest (dfs), sports betting operator (sportsbook), and virtual casino platform (igaming). Essentially it's a fucking money pit for retards who have gambling addictions, and according to a [Harvard Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230631/#:~:text=Based%20on%20its%20analysis%20of,activities%20in%20the%20past%20year) conducted in fucking 1997, approximately 1% of adults have gambling addictions, I'm sure with todays ease of access, it's more like 2%, so, \~6.6 million retards are at severe risk to giving DraftKings their bank accounts. Like I said, this shit is a money pit, they provide a service that results in LITERAL FREE MONEY. Instead of driving to a casino, these geniuses at DraftKings are allowing some individuals to gamble from the comfort of their couch, it's amazing. Also, when I say retards, take that lightly last Saturday, I gambled away, and streamed myself in an undisclosed off-brand WSB discord, $500 in an online casino, and gamble on sports, daily, hell, last NFL season I finished first in the r/sportsbook betting contest. [PROOF (i love gambling)](https://imgur.com/gallery/woD8Vpu). With that said, if you like something buy it, if you love something invest in it. I love gambling, and will invest in the BEST *legal* sports book out there, DKNG, aka Donkey Kong, aka Donkey Dick, aka Dick Kings. :kek:

**SWOT ANALYSIS of Dick Kings**

**STRENGTHS:**

* Industry leaders: currently DKNG is legal in more [states](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/help/sports-betting/where-is-sports-betting-legal?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2Fhelp%2Fsports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal&wpcn=help&wpscn=sports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal) than any other sportsbook platform, they're legal in 11, with 2 on the brink of legalization, and a window of opportunity by eoy for the remaining 11 states where it is legal.
* Marketing/Advertising: if you're a sports guy, you'll noticed DKNG is fucking everywhere, you cant escape it. They're all over social media and are on every fucking commercial.  They spent 77% OF THEIR [REVENUE ON MARKETING PLATFORMS LMAO](https://www.actionnetwork.com/legal-online-sports-betting/draftkings-reports-increased-revenue-marketing-2020-earnings).
* Partnerships: They currently have a partnership with the NFL, UFC, MLB, three [NBA teams](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/02/draftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F&wpcn=about&wpscn=news%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F), and they own a [Nascar](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2021/05/20/draftkings-joins-nascar-star-bubba-wallace-23xi-racing/). Not only that, but Disney (ESPN) has a 6% stake in their company, yeah the largest sports network in America owns a [6% stake of DKNG.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17950769) (dont fuck with the mouse). They also have upcoming partnerships with Dish Network, and I'm sure they have a fuck ton of other promotions on the way.
* Ease of access: you literally type it in the browser, or download an app. Deposit you wage cuck check through paypal or via debit card and within 1 hour your entire check could be gone, it's that easy.
* UI: You know how everyone says, ""oh don't use robinhood, it's bad, it's so cancer, they sell your data."" Shut the fuck up, you know that UI is fucking sexy and that's why you keep buying FDs that's the same shit with DKNG. I've used hundreds of online casinos and sportsbook, personally bovada is my go to, but for legal books, DraftKings is by far the best, no question. That platform is sexy, look how clean this is compared to fanduel.

**WEAKNESSES:**

* They care too much, and try to hard to make as much money as possible? wtf? you thought imma drop actual weaknesses, imma straight shill. No thanks LMAO. Fan Duel, Barstool sportsbook is straight trash. dafuq.

**OPPORTUNITIES:**

* State Legalizations, currently there are only 24 states where sportsbooks, igaming is legal, but it's expected to be legal nationwide in the next 1-3 years. Maryland, Nevada, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and New York are on the brink of having DKNG in their states. I know a few of those states legalize literally just last week.
* Partnerships, with the amount of money DraftKings is spending, they're going to have deals with the NHL, NBA and possibly even some college ball in the next few months. I wouldn't be surprised to see DKNG become the official sportsbook of the NFL in the future. I know a few [stadiums](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.giants.com/news/draftkings-and-new-york-giants-announce-official-exclusive-sports-betting-deal) offer DKNG sportsbook in stadium, and I think this will become the norm in the next few years. You'll be able to go to a ballpark, stadium and place your bet directly there right next to your $40 beer (cause inflation).
* Social Media. I think where it stands right now, if you google DraftKings, their social media platform is okay, but in the next few months, especially near NFL season, it'll absolutely explode. They obviously have a facebook, twitter accounts, instagram and they are extremely interactive, they have daily podcasts and shit, but that's all so new. Their accounts are all growing, and I know as their social media presence becomes established, their brand name will grow as well.
* Buyouts, again, as a I said above Disney has a 6% stake in DKNG, I wouldn't be surprised to see Disney too onto their ownership and possible even buyout Draft Kings, I mean, imagine that. Disney, ESPN and DraftKings, all under the same parent company. That would be insane. You don't see Barstool (Penn), or Fanduel with that kind of opportunity.
* Igaming, I think this platform is so slept on. Virtual casinos are the fucking future, let me tell you, I've been doing this shit for years and once you legal bros get into this shit, you'll be hooked. There's absolutely nothing better than sitting your fat ass on the couch and blowing through hundreds of dollars betting martingale on black 7 times in a row. SHIT IS FUCKING GREAT. If they can develop a strong Igaming presence, they'll be loaded. Igaming is \~$[250 billion industry](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/gaming-market-2020-2025-size-share-trends-growth-value-and-research-report-2021-03-03?tesla=y#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,Mobile)

**THREATS:**

* Their only threat is competition, which is actually a strength because their competition is dog water. Barstool Sports can't get a partnership with the largest revenue sport, the NFL, because the NFL commish Roger Goodell absolutely hates the face of Barstool, aka Portnoy. I love Portnoy, but guy is a week away from some fucked up-cocaine induced canceling, I'm telling you. Barstool will entertain the stoolies, but they'll never become the Mcdonalds of fastfood, they'll always be the fucking nasty ass trash Burger King that you have to go to because the Mcdonalds line is too long. Fanduel is owned by a UK company, what do they know about American sports. WHAT COMPETITION.

Their revenue has absolutely gone bananas in Q1, which is fucking insane, because there were some rumors that DKNG lost a fuck ton of money from the [superbowl](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nhbr.com/the-brady-effect-new-hampshire-lottery-sacked-in-super-bowl-betting/#:~:text=State%20takes%20a%20%243%20million,the%20Bucs%20and%20their%20QB&text=While%20New%20Englanders%20bet%20heavily,hole%20on%20Super%20Bowl%20Sunday). Anyway, as you can see their revenue grew a dick-ton. The big scary here is their net is horrible, why, the big no no? Sales and Marketing. I was worried about that too, but that's their game plan, to a spend a fuck ton of money to game market dominance early on, retention rate is key to this industry. Jason Robbins their CEO said it on a [podcast the other day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93aGVyZXRoZW1vbmV5aXMubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/Nzg3ZDM1Y2QtMTgxYS00ODBhLTllZGMtMzFmZDdlNWNlMTIx?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwisjdvGtt7wAhWKUt8KHVAoCCkQjrkEegQIBBAI&ep=6), they're in preseason, training camp in this market. They're still warming up to the full opportunity.

So to touch upon their spending again, as you can see their spending is working. They gained new degens at a rate of 114% compared to the first quarter of 2020. INSANE GROWTH. They're growing and retaining rates at a crazy level.

[more good. less bad.](https://preview.redd.it/ezqljieg3w071.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=690df56ebd62a93b9ec73feaad69223f02f07997)

tl;dr REVENUE PUMP. They're expected to blow revenue out of the water, shit is going full parabolic. Raising revenue guidance to $1.15 billion,

DKNG is sitting pretty right above their low price target at $42.00, and you aint buying? Look at these price targets, a ceiling of $105.

Look at the dates of filing and values. A lot of the media is shitting on Cathie Woods for buying DKNG religiously, but nobody is shitting on BlackRock for owning over 8million shares. As a wise man once told man, BlackRock is the United States testicles, they are the balls of this country. If they buy something, you know that shit is going to cum to the moon. It's insane how many of these big names are buying right now.

**Technical Analysis** so I hate to be the guy, but this is the [only stock I've traded all year](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/).

SHORT TERM(1-3 months):

[wedge, no vol.](https://preview.redd.it/ueoiofxw3w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=0806df6ce5521a17081b3a632be2b02361c355e4)

As you can see from the chart above, we're currently trading in between the 7d sma and 50d sma on the 2hr. This is most likely complete confirmation bias, but I backed tested when DKNG has a daily closed inbetween this same crunch since it drooped the spac name, and whenever it has this same set up, these are the next day, and or two day returns.

02/10 +10.48% , 03/04 +13.89% , 03/25 +1.62% , 07/16 +9.46% , 09/09 +9.11% , 11/05 +9.05% , 1/08/21 +4.48% ,3/10/21 +11.48% , 04/26/21 +1.91%

Try it yourself. This is actually the reason why I bought weeklies eod friday. Check my positions at the top. I think in the next few weeks, DKNG will go to that top level resistance line at \~49.5, and then it could trade sideways for a bit longer to fill that volume gap from 44.5 to 49.5, but I do think a pump day is coming nonetheless.

&#x200B;

LONG TERM(3-12 months):

[Support \/ Meme Line](https://preview.redd.it/014ln9o04w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=845d45afafea0c86a25b60729e5039fb328d1c45)

So, longterm (3-12 month window), referring to the chart at the top, it looks like DKNG has found support off the 35.5 bottom it hit in September, there's massive volume support at the 42.5 line, and that looks to be the new floor (god forbid a market crash happens soon, plz no fomc june 18th taper tantrum). It looks like the next major test for DKNG is at the 200d SMA or 51.52. If you look at RSI, it's leaving oversold territory, and MACD is flashing a reversal. I think we're due for a next wave of highs on DKNG. I could see this popping to \~49.5-51.5 -> \~60 -> all time highs. TA is looking dumb bullish you fucking idiots. Buy this shit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**CONCLUSION**

in conclusion, I fucking love the stock. Technical and Fundamentals showing a strong buy. Dick Kings is about to cum, and be sure you're there to catch the cum, because once this thing is near it's edge, it's going to absolute nut. I know I wont want to miss suc.. am I gay? anyway. buy dkng.

TL;DR I might be gay now, but buy DKNG, Shit looks like an absolute steal. Later nerds **$DKNG 100c 1/21/22** [POSITIONS HERE I AM AUTISTIC](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://imgur.com/gallery/7ZK85CN)",njaa8g,Why I'm Large and in Charge for Dick Kings (DKNG)

It's rather shocking to me that most people have never heard of ImmunityBio - IBRX in the biotech space.  They have this new drug called Anktiva could be a new cancer drug for a wide range of cancers. Not just one type but looks to be for mutliple types of cancers based on the study.  Seems like the side-effects are minimal.  Only downside I see from the study is that it's only a phase 2 trial of 140 patients so it's not as wide-ranging as a phase 3 study.  Although, Anktiva got a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in another phase 3 study.  So FDA approval could be on the horizon since a phase 3 was done for bladder cancer. 

But apparently according to the phase 2 study, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. . Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda).  Could be hope for those who have failed previous treatments for various solid tumors.   If you know of anyone that has cancer and has failed or is failing treatment(s), I would call up IBRX and try to get in a study.

I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I've consumed lately.
&nbsp;


##Let‚Äôs start with a look at overall market performance by sector

I like to use this to establish a point of reference - _what_ kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly?

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/cV2n4du)

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD](https://imgur.com/LrgETAx)

I‚Äôm using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that‚Äôs a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year‚Äôs growth trade has lagged and given back.

##Now let‚Äôs look at index performance:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/eaDWp9s)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/iGGKKee)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/57uD3Ue)

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.   
**Take-Aways**  

- Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce, seemingly fueled by panic-buying at the Thursday open.  
- The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces; for SPY the 50DMA has held, QQQ support at 316.  
- Despite the recent volatility, we have no had a significant drawdown; we're still close to ATHs on these indices, and specifically I look at QQQ's chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year.
- IWM appears to have formed a range, which I‚Äôd say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March. This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value (shown below) that started around this time. This chart is something to watch - if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run. 

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected ETFs 1y](https://imgur.com/kkdbTmk)

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

**Conjecture**  

- You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop: we‚Äôve held some established support and bounced nicely so hard to see us really breaking down further, alternatively we‚Äôve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between, which could be a sign of weakening  and indication of possible further downside.
- Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets. With the growing proliferation of the latter, we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on/with equities (or other) markets. If a bubble is bursting here, does it signal a growing risk-off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well? 


##Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year

I'm just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading; this is what I have in mind _right now_, but all of this can change in an instant of course: 

**Summer -** expecting the reflation trade (financials, energy, industrials, value) to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform.

**June FOMC -** There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here‚Ä¶ or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting.

**August Jackson Hole Meetup -** If we haven‚Äôt heard anything regarding tapering prior, speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change, as that‚Äôs what happened last year with inflation targeting. With fear of a taper tantrum, we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this.

**Late Summer -** If we haven‚Äôt had one by now, I‚Äôd expect a meaningful (10%) pullback. 

**Inflation Data -** June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes, but if we continue to get high prints into July, August, and later this year, inflation will become a real issue.

**Fall -** We start to get murky here. I‚Äôd look for a late-year rally to follow any pullback, but it‚Äôs hard to say; too many unknowns. 

**EOY Targets -** CNBC‚Äôs median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800. Consider we‚Äôre already +11%, +%12, +4% YTD on SPY, IWM, and QQQ respectively, and +86%, +119%, +92% since the March 2020 lows, is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near-term?

**Considerations**
- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Consider seasonality. We‚Äôre entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It‚Äôs something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- Have long exposure, but be careful with positioning and time horizons. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit, but there is no way you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&nbsp;

I think right now if you‚Äôre long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them. 

## Bonus Charts

**Commodities Performance**

I thought it would be interesting to look at the recent performance of certain commodities in comparison with major indices:

[Select Commodities vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/fRAUEyt)

[Select Commodities ETFs vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/jH48XtQ)

Lumber‚Äôs performance slightly skews the first chart, but in both we can see well enough that a divergence starting to occur in early-mid April - something to continue to watch as it‚Äôs a correlation with the inflation narrative but more specifically the supply chain issues we‚Äôve had. 

**Comparing Recent and (Recently) Historical Index Performance**

When considering the EOY Target data and the recent performance of equities, I thought it would be interesting to scale back a little further and do some historical comparisons:

[SPY 5y](https://imgur.com/NL0qgBn)

[QQQ 5y](https://imgur.com/aMIv0Xc)

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I‚Äôm big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I‚Äôve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I‚Äôve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE‚Äôs float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE‚Äôs 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled ‚ÄúHindenburg MVIS‚Äù and the second article that popped up was titled ‚ÄúTechnically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.‚Äù This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE‚Äôs pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg‚Äôs attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM‚Äôs investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that ‚ÄúTimeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.‚Äù

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio‚Äôs Endorsement of LMC:** üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn‚Äôt mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it ‚Äú‚Äòbull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don‚Äôt get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.‚Äù

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): ‚ÄúI think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area ‚Äî Voltage Valley as we like to call it ‚Äî but all over Ohio.‚Äù

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) ‚ÄúReally, this is the future,‚Äù DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. ‚ÄúI think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.‚Äù

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he‚Äôs visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he‚Äôs seen the company‚Äôs robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he‚Äôs seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre way way way far along,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.‚Äù

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE‚ÄôS**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced ‚ÄúLordstown Week‚Äù](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.
* [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now).
* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you‚Äôd be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I‚Äôm planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20‚Äôs. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

[$UWMC 20 Day 2 Hour](https://preview.redd.it/titkhs0fmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=142a5763bf0da2864af7776d8e7cdb488607f00a)

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

774,,2021-05-23 21:04:15,t3_njh8a7,,wallstreetbets,"Money¬†is used as a¬†medium of exchange, and as a¬†store of value.

In money supply statistics, central bank money is¬†MB¬†while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3¬†components. Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of¬†M1,¬†while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as¬†M2¬†and¬†M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of¬†currency in circulation¬†and¬†checking account¬†balances.
M2: M1 + most¬†savings accounts,¬†money market accounts, retail¬†money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit¬†of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other¬†CDs¬†(large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of¬†eurodollars¬†and¬†repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 +¬†Commercial Paper
M4: M4- +¬†T-Bills¬†(or M3 + Commercial Paper +¬†T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States¬†Federal Reserve¬†published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people‚Äôs saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People‚Äôs deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

775,,2021-05-23 21:05:18,t3_njh97r,,wallstreetbets,"Alright retards, I'm in here with a little bit of weekend DD. ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.
776,,2021-05-23 22:13:52,t3_njipr1,,wallstreetbets,"Liquified natural gas, LNG, is one of the world's fastest growing fuel sources. Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares.

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth? This new product is quite impressive and going to be a key thing to keep an eye on because [they want to spin-off Kbank and the current estimated value is about $7 billion dollars](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html).

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding.

785,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

797,,2021-05-24 13:22:58,t3_njxv95,,wallstreetbets,"**Preamble:** The current jump in US consumer prices has understandably spooked investors. The current CPI numbers stand at 4.2 percent which is the highest they have been since Sep 2008 (the increase was almost 4x of what was expected). 

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

People talk about how toxic the great pacific garbage patch is but fail to consider how beneficial a great pacific energy system could be. Using techniques pioneered in the construction of Asfluidijk in the Netherlands, we can map energy output as a function of dam geometry, ocean floor bathymetry, and tidal patterns. It‚Äôs called dynamic tidal power (DTP) and my project I‚Äôve been (kinda putting off since I started trading) working on is creating an engine that can explore and refine these distributions using real current velocity data. Basically I want to build a Microsoft Flight Simulator meets rollercoaster tycoon but for renewable energy structures. Once the engine is out there, and if it works, well have a starting point to compare DTP to traditional hydro, solar, and nuclear.

First off, if you've been living under a rock and don't know what Alibaba is, here's a video about what the company does from CNN Business. [https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness)

Alibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 6 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I took notice when these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that environmentally sustainable (basically they just monitor their carbon footprint), something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yen (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, roughly 10% off it's 52 week low.

Now what REALLY turned my head was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO. For Munger, one of THE most risk-adverse investors in history, to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

Since Munger's position was revealed, Reddit users took notice and has become the most talked about undervalued stock on Reddit.

In short, there are times when investing seems easy. As Buffett says ""We simply attempt to be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.""",niwxaz,Buffet's Right Hand Man Buys $BABA. $BABA Becomes the Top Undervalued Stock to Buy Now on Reddit.
1354,,2021-05-23 01:31:33,t3_nix3nq,,wallstreetbets,"This asshat started tolling on my post (my perspective): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i\_spy\_521\_recap\_and\_524\_outlook/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i_spy_521_recap_and_524_outlook/)

And then called me out in a post - without calling me out. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical\_analysis\_on\_smoothed\_moving\_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical_analysis_on_smoothed_moving_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3)

So id just like to give my perspective on what I'm seeing on the charts. Its all in the eye of the beholder so take it as a grain of salt. This TA has helped me make money and, I believe, gives me an edge. But to each his own. If you are making money with your own method then congratulations. Not gonna poo all over you if it doesn't align with my method and strategies.

From the [5/21 read post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhrou0/i_spy_521_read/)

A few things in TA my notes:

* called support and resistance levels.
* Called small moves
* Called that bulls need to break 418 and test 418 as support. As you can see we failed bulls.
* But bears did not break 414.
* Also called out a 20 SMMA test. Which we tested and failed.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/vhi7x1l5or071.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b7f89491be4eb7f6ab15b0c4e8149d803ada9f0)

From the spot gamma notes:

* look at abs gamma strike and look what was said.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/j6xkdqb9pr071.png?width=1398&format=png&auto=webp&s=df15d5b87b146ca6cdf391dbc9fada46db89a1b2)

I'd like to address this chart and comment:

""Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.""

[ To express what I see I'll provide my chart:](https://preview.redd.it/0ghkrgvhkr071.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99e69494648928d9891cb025a1da6b33f94835f)

Let's go back to the 20th first.

* 20 SMMA acted as support and was tested three times throughout the day on the 20th.
* The 20 SMMA would have played as a great indicator to BTFD for Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/1dnhk0s0lr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0dc044b41db5df168ee01cf164486e120281a5

Now lets focus on friday:

* Still have the 20 smma as support in the morning
* broke through 418 with blow-off top but failed to establish support.
* Tested 20 SMMA support at around 8 AM and failed but found support at top of gap (pretty common).
* Tested 20 SMMA as support at 9 AM but failed
* 20 SMMA now acted as resistance from about 9:15 - 11:30 (two fucking hours) Scalpers delight! Easily a 1x-3x bagger on an O'Hare.
* As you can see we bounced off the 120 SMMA and found support.
* The essentially consolidated for the rest of the day. ""*Consolidation* is the term for a *stock* or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. *Consolidated stocks* typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few *trading* opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

https://preview.redd.it/7y89c2awqr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=83d8c18d5dcf4bd08b12a1ac9e0cb00c0ee9d107

Taking this comment into account: ""Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen.""

Let's look at the RSI at the blow off top.  If you started buying O'Hare calls here then you belong in this sub.

https://preview.redd.it/s2vvxf86vr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=eca2606d4187b2ff947c6d1cfbd713101b2d9d01

TLDR - use basic ta for support and resistance. Use more than one indicator to confirm trends. Read my posts as conditional statements. If you have questions - ask - BUT don't be a dick. I provide bullish and bearish pts because like everyone else I don't know where the market is going to go in the future. SMMAs are a great tool but not good used by themselves. Use them to determine strength of trends IMO. Use them for shorting and buying opportunities off of bounces and rejections.

[Or just trade like this guy does with his ""ears to the ground"" and ""eyes open""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-qa7N-GJ-c)

And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I sobered up.  My first thought was that if the government doesn‚Äôt release the report then I‚Äôm fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report.  However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it‚Äôs another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  Many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  So does this sound logical or am I a retarded ape?",niz6qn,UFO ARKX options

1357,,2021-05-23 04:52:57,t3_nj0cj6,,wallstreetbets,"**UPDATE:** /u/5349 made a critical observation (with a confirming follow-up source from /u/33zombee) that the market cap ranking for MSCI is ***free-float adjusted***. They only count publicly tradeable shares for the market cap. This would bring UWMC's market cap down to an adjusted $830 M or so, which will significantly drop the weighting. From [this list](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/fund/1506575576011.ajax?fileType=csv&fileName=WSML_holdings&dataType=fund) of the iShares MSCI holdings, this will give UWMC a weighting of just **0.02%** rather than 0.16% as I had originally indicated. I am editing my OP below to reflect this correction. Apologies for not being diligent enough before writing this, and thanks to the additional diligence of those who pointed out the mistake!

One piece of news about United Wholesale Mortgage that has mostly gone under the radar is that UWMC will be included in the **MSCI World Small-Cap Index** starting on May 27. This has potential to be a significant catalyst next week, and I will lay out the reasons why here.

The list of new additions/deletions to this index can be found in the link to ‚ÄúMSCI Small Cap Indexes List of Additions/Deletions‚Äù on [this page](https://www.msci.com/index-review). UWMC appears on page 12 of this document as **‚ÄúUWM HLDGS A‚Äù**.

There is understandably some skepticism involved in regards to UWM and indexes after the fiasco with the Russell 1000 inclusion back in March. The blame for that mistake rests fully with FTSE Russell, as individual companies have no say on their inclusion or exclusion from the published lists. FTSE mistakenly added UWMC to the Q1 *preliminary* IPO addition list, and then later did not include it in the final list after realizing that by their own rules they do not include SPACs and a SPAC merger does not count as an IPO. But some key differences exist here with the MSCI Index.

First, the list published by MSCI is already the *final* list. It‚Äôs a done deal that UWMC will be in the MSCI index, it simply has to go into effect officially at the close of market on May 27. The other key difference, and **one which could potentially make this MSCI index inclusion a** ***~~meaningfully~~*** **~~greater catalyst~~** (update: not as significant as originally thought) than UWMC‚Äôs June inclusion in the Russell 1000 index (for real this time), is the fact that UWMC is being listed in the *small-cap index*.

Why is it beneficial for UWMC to go in the *small-cap* index? It has to do with relative weighting within the index. Companies are ranked and weighted based on their relative market cap sizes within the index. The higher ranked companies get a higher weighting and thus make up a relatively larger percentage of the index. For example, the top holding in the MSCI World Small Cap Index is CZR which has a weight of 0.23% of the index. This means that any funds that track this index would have to purchase enough shares of CZR such that the stock makes up 0.23% of the total assets of the fund.

~~So how is this bullish for UWMC? Because when UWMC is added to the index, it will likely be one of the~~ **~~top ten in ranking~~** ~~(or just outside the top ten) based on its current market cap.~~ [~~This page~~](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) ~~from BlackRock‚Äôs iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF shows the top ten ranked holdings. TPR is the 9th company in this list (top is cash) as of May 20, 2021, with a relative weighting of 0.16%. As of the close of market Friday, TPR has a market cap of just under $12 Billion. In comparison, UWMC closed Friday with a higher market cap of $12.95 Billion. So this means that upon official inclusion, UWMC should be ranked right around the 10th place position, which should~~ **~~give it a weighting of approximately 0.16%~~**~~.~~

**(Update: Free float adjustment gives UWMC a market cap of around $830 M, giving it approximately a 0.02% weighting in the index)** 

This allows us to then calculate the approximate number of shares of UWMC that funds tracking the MSCI World Small-Cap Index will need to purchase when it is officially added. I found three main ETFs that track this index. There are likely other funds, but these three are sufficient I believe to make the case for why this is a meaningful catalyst.

In comparison, when UWMC is added to the Russell 1000, it will be ranked right around 550th place based on its current market cap, giving it a weighting of 0.03%. It‚Äôs inclusion in the Russell will still be a positive thing, given that there are many more funds that track the Russell than the MSCI index. ~~But because of the 5.3x higher weighting that UWMC will have in the MSCI index, this gives its inclusion some significant OOMPH (legitimate financial term)~~ (update: not as much OOMPH as originally thought). [Studies have shown](https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion) that when a stock moves from the Russell 1000 down to the Russell 2000 due to a reduction in its market cap, the share price tends to move *up* shortly thereafter, because now it is one of the top companies in its respective index (with a higher respective weighting) rather than one of the smallest.

TL;DR: it is better to be a BIG fish in a ^(small) (cap) index than to be a small fish in a large index. Thus, I believe we can anticipate good things ahead with UWMC‚Äôs inclusion in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index.",nj0cj6,Detailed analysis on why UWMC‚Äôs addition to the MSCI World Small-Cap Index can be a significant catalyst

They supply semiconductor and display drivers to laptops, smartphones, tv's and cars. They also develop their own technology, such as a proprietary 3D Sensor technology for facial recognition used in security applications, and their WiseEye technology for motion detection in AI applications.

THE BASICS

$HIMX is one of the few stocks in the tech / semiconductor sector that offers Value & Growth, with a potential near term window for a short squeeze.

$HIMX is currently trading at $10.36 / share 

They crushed their last earnings report with an EPS of $.38 , outperforming their guidance of $.30 - $.34 . Their gross margin was 40%, also outperforming their 38% guidance.

[https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX\_1Q21\_Earnings\_PR\_Final.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX_1Q21_Earnings_PR_Final.pdf)

Additionally, their Q2 guidance is very positive. The are estimating at EPS of between $.54 and $.60 , and an even better gross margin of 45% - 47%

INSANLELY UNDERVALUED at $10.36 / share

If you can find a better value in the tech/semiconductor sector, let me know. But these numbers are getting to be a little insane.

The stock saw a pop up to $15/share after a pre-earnings announcement in April. But since then it's been the target of a short campaign, and been forced down by general market feelings toward the tech sector, as well as inflation fears. But look at these numbers:

Trailing P/E is 16.09

Forward P/E is 5.41

Market Cap is  $1.8 Billion

Trailing revenue is $1 billion 

Cash heavy with d $245.8 million in cash in Q1, and only $57 million in loan debt

This company has a healthy balance sheet, plenty of cash, and it's yearly revenue 55% of it's market cap.

Here's the thing. Institutional ownership is relatively low, which makes this stock an easy target for manipulation. As of this quarter, institutions own 19.25% of the company, but that's up from 12% from the previous quarter, with about $60 positive inflows from filings this quarter. These were all trades made in Q1 that were reported this quarter.

&#x200B;

But since their last earnings release earlier this month, the price has tanked. There's been insane Put volume, and it seems someone with a lot of buying power is manipulating this stock downward, perhaps in an attempt to exercise puts.

June 18th is particularly interesting. Take a look at Put open interest for June 18th. 41,664 OI on a $9/put.

There was similar Put interest this past week at the $10.50 strike price . . . and low and behold, the stock closed at $10.36 on this past Friday.

I'm no options expert, but I think it's clear we have some manipulation, perhaps with the intent to for MM's or hedges to drive price down and exercise cheap puts to pick this stock up even cheaper.

But how far can the stock get driven down?

There's a few things to take into consideration on the downside.

1. Taiwan Drought - Drought in Taiwan has effected chip industry. So far it hasn't effected Himax though, and the claim to have secured supply chain growth for the remaining of the year.
2. Taiwan Covid - There's been an outbreak of Covid cases. This could disrupt production, but  Taiwan seems to be working quick to curtail the issue. This is definitely an unknown at this point.
3. Past Fraud Allegations: in 2017 Citron Research accused Himax of providing false information on forward guidance statments. No official charges were levied though.

4. Bollinger bands analysis suggest further downside to single digits before a rebound. THis is without future catalyst, or renewed interest in the stock [https://stockinvest.us/stock/HIMX](https://stockinvest.us/stock/HIMX)

Now, some recent Catalysts to the upside.

3. DIVIDEND ANOUNCEMENT: Himax suspended dividends last year because of Covid, but many speculate a dividend is coming soon. Taiwan companies are incentivized to pay out dividends though very large tax breaks. A dividend announcement would surely bring in further institutional investors. 

So there you have it. This is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. Just a heads up that HIMX seems to have some short term short interest, but could be ready to kick off. I'll let you decide.",nj6x5e,"$HIMX DD , Value AND Growth in Tech sector??"

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/rc961bm4hv071.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4701a99fd4471a560552f895ebcc817e72e334d3

GME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \[Redacted\] as a payment option.

Newcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.¬†We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \[redacted\], a new \[redacted\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.

**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker‚Äôs Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it‚Äôs slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.

**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford‚Äôs CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

* Partnerships, with the amount of money DraftKings is spending, they're going to have deals with the NHL, NBA and possibly even some college ball in the next few months. I wouldn't be surprised to see DKNG become the official sportsbook of the NFL in the future. I know a few [stadiums](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.giants.com/news/draftkings-and-new-york-giants-announce-official-exclusive-sports-betting-deal) offer DKNG sportsbook in stadium, and I think this will become the norm in the next few years. You'll be able to go to a ballpark, stadium and place your bet directly there right next to your $40 beer (cause inflation).
* Social Media. I think where it stands right now, if you google DraftKings, their social media platform is okay, but in the next few months, especially near NFL season, it'll absolutely explode. They obviously have a facebook, twitter accounts, instagram and they are extremely interactive, they have daily podcasts and shit, but that's all so new. Their accounts are all growing, and I know as their social media presence becomes established, their brand name will grow as well.
* Buyouts, again, as a I said above Disney has a 6% stake in DKNG, I wouldn't be surprised to see Disney too onto their ownership and possible even buyout Draft Kings, I mean, imagine that. Disney, ESPN and DraftKings, all under the same parent company. That would be insane. You don't see Barstool (Penn), or Fanduel with that kind of opportunity.
* Igaming, I think this platform is so slept on. Virtual casinos are the fucking future, let me tell you, I've been doing this shit for years and once you legal bros get into this shit, you'll be hooked. There's absolutely nothing better than sitting your fat ass on the couch and blowing through hundreds of dollars betting martingale on black 7 times in a row. SHIT IS FUCKING GREAT. If they can develop a strong Igaming presence, they'll be loaded. Igaming is \~$[250 billion industry](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/gaming-market-2020-2025-size-share-trends-growth-value-and-research-report-2021-03-03?tesla=y#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,Mobile)

**THREATS:**

* Their only threat is competition, which is actually a strength because their competition is dog water. Barstool Sports can't get a partnership with the largest revenue sport, the NFL, because the NFL commish Roger Goodell absolutely hates the face of Barstool, aka Portnoy. I love Portnoy, but guy is a week away from some fucked up-cocaine induced canceling, I'm telling you. Barstool will entertain the stoolies, but they'll never become the Mcdonalds of fastfood, they'll always be the fucking nasty ass trash Burger King that you have to go to because the Mcdonalds line is too long. Fanduel is owned by a UK company, what do they know about American sports. WHAT COMPETITION.

Their revenue has absolutely gone bananas in Q1, which is fucking insane, because there were some rumors that DKNG lost a fuck ton of money from the [superbowl](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nhbr.com/the-brady-effect-new-hampshire-lottery-sacked-in-super-bowl-betting/#:~:text=State%20takes%20a%20%243%20million,the%20Bucs%20and%20their%20QB&text=While%20New%20Englanders%20bet%20heavily,hole%20on%20Super%20Bowl%20Sunday). Anyway, as you can see their revenue grew a dick-ton. The big scary here is their net is horrible, why, the big no no? Sales and Marketing. I was worried about that too, but that's their game plan, to a spend a fuck ton of money to game market dominance early on, retention rate is key to this industry. Jason Robbins their CEO said it on a [podcast the other day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93aGVyZXRoZW1vbmV5aXMubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/Nzg3ZDM1Y2QtMTgxYS00ODBhLTllZGMtMzFmZDdlNWNlMTIx?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwisjdvGtt7wAhWKUt8KHVAoCCkQjrkEegQIBBAI&ep=6), they're in preseason, training camp in this market. They're still warming up to the full opportunity.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/draftkings-reports-first-quarter-2021-results-and-raises-2021](https://preview.redd.it/4w1istie3w071.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=6116ae4857dac73c83688feb1796471896cdaac8)

So to touch upon their spending again, as you can see their spending is working. They gained new degens at a rate of 114% compared to the first quarter of 2020. INSANE GROWTH. They're growing and retaining rates at a crazy level.

[more good. less bad.](https://preview.redd.it/ezqljieg3w071.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=690df56ebd62a93b9ec73feaad69223f02f07997)

tl;dr REVENUE PUMP. They're expected to blow revenue out of the water, shit is going full parabolic. Raising revenue guidance to $1.15 billion,

DKNG only has access to 25% of the U.S. population as of right now, and the stock is at what $45, what till this shit nation wide.

No dilution until $135 a share, and you aren't buying this absolute diamond right now? wtf.

**Price Targets**

DKNG is sitting pretty right above their low price target at $42.00, and you aint buying? Look at these price targets, a ceiling of $105.

&#x200B;

**Institutional Ownership**

Look at the dates of filing and values. A lot of the media is shitting on Cathie Woods for buying DKNG religiously, but nobody is shitting on BlackRock for owning over 8million shares. As a wise man once told man, BlackRock is the United States testicles, they are the balls of this country. If they buy something, you know that shit is going to cum to the moon. It's insane how many of these big names are buying right now.

**Technical Analysis** so I hate to be the guy, but this is the [only stock I've traded all year](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/).

SHORT TERM(1-3 months):

[wedge, no vol.](https://preview.redd.it/ueoiofxw3w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=0806df6ce5521a17081b3a632be2b02361c355e4)

As you can see from the chart above, we're currently trading in between the 7d sma and 50d sma on the 2hr. This is most likely complete confirmation bias, but I backed tested when DKNG has a daily closed inbetween this same crunch since it drooped the spac name, and whenever it has this same set up, these are the next day, and or two day returns.

02/10 +10.48% , 03/04 +13.89% , 03/25 +1.62% , 07/16 +9.46% , 09/09 +9.11% , 11/05 +9.05% , 1/08/21 +4.48% ,3/10/21 +11.48% , 04/26/21 +1.91%

Try it yourself. This is actually the reason why I bought weeklies eod friday. Check my positions at the top. I think in the next few weeks, DKNG will go to that top level resistance line at \~49.5, and then it could trade sideways for a bit longer to fill that volume gap from 44.5 to 49.5, but I do think a pump day is coming nonetheless.

&#x200B;

LONG TERM(3-12 months):

[Support \/ Meme Line](https://preview.redd.it/014ln9o04w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=845d45afafea0c86a25b60729e5039fb328d1c45)

[RSI oversold](https://preview.redd.it/lsnl6oo34w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=f843db525edb8cac78c82849e727b6dac367a342)

So, longterm (3-12 month window), referring to the chart at the top, it looks like DKNG has found support off the 35.5 bottom it hit in September, there's massive volume support at the 42.5 line, and that looks to be the new floor (god forbid a market crash happens soon, plz no fomc june 18th taper tantrum). It looks like the next major test for DKNG is at the 200d SMA or 51.52. If you look at RSI, it's leaving oversold territory, and MACD is flashing a reversal. I think we're due for a next wave of highs on DKNG. I could see this popping to \~49.5-51.5 -> \~60 -> all time highs. TA is looking dumb bullish you fucking idiots. Buy this shit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**CONCLUSION**

in conclusion, I fucking love the stock. Technical and Fundamentals showing a strong buy. Dick Kings is about to cum, and be sure you're there to catch the cum, because once this thing is near it's edge, it's going to absolute nut. I know I wont want to miss suc.. am I gay? anyway. buy dkng.

It's rather shocking to me that most people have never heard of ImmunityBio - IBRX in the biotech space.  They have this new drug called Anktiva could be a new cancer drug for a wide range of cancers. Not just one type but looks to be for mutliple types of cancers based on the study.  Seems like the side-effects are minimal.  Only downside I see from the study is that it's only a phase 2 trial of 140 patients so it's not as wide-ranging as a phase 3 study.  Although, Anktiva got a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in another phase 3 study.  So FDA approval could be on the horizon since a phase 3 was done for bladder cancer. 

But apparently according to the phase 2 study, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. . Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda).  Could be hope for those who have failed previous treatments for various solid tumors.   If you know of anyone that has cancer and has failed or is failing treatment(s), I would call up IBRX and try to get in a study.

I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I've consumed lately.
&nbsp;


##Let‚Äôs start with a look at overall market performance by sector

I like to use this to establish a point of reference - _what_ kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly?

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/cV2n4du)

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD](https://imgur.com/LrgETAx)

I‚Äôm using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that‚Äôs a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year‚Äôs growth trade has lagged and given back.

##Now let‚Äôs look at index performance:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/eaDWp9s)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/iGGKKee)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/57uD3Ue)

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.   
**Take-Aways**  

- Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce, seemingly fueled by panic-buying at the Thursday open.  
- The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces; for SPY the 50DMA has held, QQQ support at 316.  
- Despite the recent volatility, we have no had a significant drawdown; we're still close to ATHs on these indices, and specifically I look at QQQ's chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year.
- IWM appears to have formed a range, which I‚Äôd say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March. This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value (shown below) that started around this time. This chart is something to watch - if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run. 

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected ETFs 1y](https://imgur.com/kkdbTmk)

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

**Conjecture**  

- You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop: we‚Äôve held some established support and bounced nicely so hard to see us really breaking down further, alternatively we‚Äôve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between, which could be a sign of weakening  and indication of possible further downside.
- Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets. With the growing proliferation of the latter, we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on/with equities (or other) markets. If a bubble is bursting here, does it signal a growing risk-off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well? 


##Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year

I'm just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading; this is what I have in mind _right now_, but all of this can change in an instant of course: 

**Summer -** expecting the reflation trade (financials, energy, industrials, value) to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform.

**June FOMC -** There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here‚Ä¶ or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting.

**August Jackson Hole Meetup -** If we haven‚Äôt heard anything regarding tapering prior, speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change, as that‚Äôs what happened last year with inflation targeting. With fear of a taper tantrum, we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this.

**Late Summer -** If we haven‚Äôt had one by now, I‚Äôd expect a meaningful (10%) pullback. 

**Inflation Data -** June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes, but if we continue to get high prints into July, August, and later this year, inflation will become a real issue.

**Fall -** We start to get murky here. I‚Äôd look for a late-year rally to follow any pullback, but it‚Äôs hard to say; too many unknowns. 

**EOY Targets -** CNBC‚Äôs median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800. Consider we‚Äôre already +11%, +%12, +4% YTD on SPY, IWM, and QQQ respectively, and +86%, +119%, +92% since the March 2020 lows, is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near-term?

**Considerations**
- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Consider seasonality. We‚Äôre entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It‚Äôs something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- Have long exposure, but be careful with positioning and time horizons. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit, but there is no way you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&nbsp;

I think right now if you‚Äôre long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them. 

## Bonus Charts

**Commodities Performance**

I thought it would be interesting to look at the recent performance of certain commodities in comparison with major indices:

[Select Commodities vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/fRAUEyt)

[Select Commodities ETFs vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/jH48XtQ)

Lumber‚Äôs performance slightly skews the first chart, but in both we can see well enough that a divergence starting to occur in early-mid April - something to continue to watch as it‚Äôs a correlation with the inflation narrative but more specifically the supply chain issues we‚Äôve had. 

**Comparing Recent and (Recently) Historical Index Performance**

When considering the EOY Target data and the recent performance of equities, I thought it would be interesting to scale back a little further and do some historical comparisons:

From a low of 198.65 on 28 Jun 2016 to the pre-covid high of 338.12 on 10 Feb 2020, the SPY went up ~70%.  
We can look at the yearly breakdown:

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I‚Äôm big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I‚Äôve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I‚Äôve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE‚Äôs float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE‚Äôs 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled ‚ÄúHindenburg MVIS‚Äù and the second article that popped up was titled ‚ÄúTechnically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.‚Äù This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE‚Äôs pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg‚Äôs attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM‚Äôs investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that ‚ÄúTimeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.‚Äù

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio‚Äôs Endorsement of LMC:** üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn‚Äôt mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it ‚Äú‚Äòbull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don‚Äôt get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.‚Äù

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): ‚ÄúI think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area ‚Äî Voltage Valley as we like to call it ‚Äî but all over Ohio.‚Äù

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) ‚ÄúReally, this is the future,‚Äù DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. ‚ÄúI think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.‚Äù

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he‚Äôs visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he‚Äôs seen the company‚Äôs robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he‚Äôs seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre way way way far along,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.‚Äù

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE‚ÄôS**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced ‚ÄúLordstown Week‚Äù](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.
* [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now).
* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you‚Äôd be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I‚Äôm planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20‚Äôs. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

[$UWMC 20 Day 2 Hour](https://preview.redd.it/titkhs0fmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=142a5763bf0da2864af7776d8e7cdb488607f00a)

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

1382,,2021-05-23 21:04:15,t3_njh8a7,,wallstreetbets,"Money¬†is used as a¬†medium of exchange, and as a¬†store of value.

In money supply statistics, central bank money is¬†MB¬†while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3¬†components. Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of¬†M1,¬†while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as¬†M2¬†and¬†M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of¬†currency in circulation¬†and¬†checking account¬†balances.
M2: M1 + most¬†savings accounts,¬†money market accounts, retail¬†money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit¬†of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other¬†CDs¬†(large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of¬†eurodollars¬†and¬†repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 +¬†Commercial Paper
M4: M4- +¬†T-Bills¬†(or M3 + Commercial Paper +¬†T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States¬†Federal Reserve¬†published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people‚Äôs saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People‚Äôs deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.

Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares. There has been several secondaries over the past 18 month and the price action has generally been a significant pullback then an aggressive rebound. We are at the bottom of the pullback right now.  See chart link below from the mattress king indicating previous secondaries and subsequent recoveries.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth?

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

1393,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Don't think I need to say anything here. It's pretty obvious that there could be a very sharp rebound from the trendline soon enough

Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

I didnt oversimplify it. You asked what would one use. And i gave two solutions. I understand VLOOKUP is not an elegant solution as it searches right to left or left to right. Im sure its right to left lol.

The two solutions provided. Either using a VM db setup, cleaner, shareable. And allows anyone to access it anywhere vs using the array formula from within excel itself was a pretty simple IMO and far better than VLOOKUP. was just trying to help. You see what i did there? Help.

You can't eat it, you can't multiply it and you can't even make fire with it. Golden comets fly through space, rare metals are not as much defined by scarcity these days and the era of physical evaluation is sending it's regards. So I wouldn't be so sure.

But you will always be able to buy food and wood for the fire. Mining in space will certainly be very expensive and someday maybe even a reality when there are no more resources on earth. Everyone should do it as he thinks, I know what I do and so far very satisfied. I have hedged myself and therefore completely independent of crypto or fiat currencies. So this is absolutely perfect. Physical precious metals like gold and silver, commodities and mines with substance and still PSLV that is my way.  
No investment advice, everyone should think for himself what he does.

https://preview.redd.it/rc961bm4hv071.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4701a99fd4471a560552f895ebcc817e72e334d3

GME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \[Redacted\] as a payment option.

Newcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.¬†We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \[redacted\], a new \[redacted\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.

**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker‚Äôs Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it‚Äôs slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.

**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford‚Äôs CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

Thank you for reading!

Before I start, he's my [track record](https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:TheHappyItalianMan), you can obviously check my post history too.

My DD's generally end up in the right direct, but this current one will be my largest bet to date. So here we fucking go my fellow autists. You ready to learn about Dick Kings?  Whats the fucking play? It's DraftKings (DKNG). **$DKNG 100c 1/21/22**

**DraftKings** is an American daily fantasy sports contest (dfs), sports betting operator (sportsbook), and virtual casino platform (igaming). Essentially it's a fucking money pit for retards who have gambling addictions, and according to a [Harvard Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230631/#:~:text=Based%20on%20its%20analysis%20of,activities%20in%20the%20past%20year) conducted in fucking 1997, approximately 1% of adults have gambling addictions, I'm sure with todays ease of access, it's more like 2%, so, \~6.6 million retards are at severe risk to giving DraftKings their bank accounts. Like I said, this shit is a money pit, they provide a service that results in LITERAL FREE MONEY. Instead of driving to a casino, these geniuses at DraftKings are allowing some individuals to gamble from the comfort of their couch, it's amazing. Also, when I say retards, take that lightly last Saturday, I gambled away, and streamed myself in an undisclosed off-brand WSB discord, $500 in an online casino, and gamble on sports, daily, hell, last NFL season I finished first in the r/sportsbook betting contest. [PROOF (i love gambling)](https://imgur.com/gallery/woD8Vpu). With that said, if you like something buy it, if you love something invest in it. I love gambling, and will invest in the BEST *legal* sports book out there, DKNG, aka Donkey Kong, aka Donkey Dick, aka Dick Kings. :kek:

**SWOT ANALYSIS of Dick Kings**

**STRENGTHS:**

* Industry leaders: currently DKNG is legal in more [states](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/help/sports-betting/where-is-sports-betting-legal?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2Fhelp%2Fsports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal&wpcn=help&wpscn=sports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal) than any other sportsbook platform, they're legal in 11, with 2 on the brink of legalization, and a window of opportunity by eoy for the remaining 11 states where it is legal.
* Marketing/Advertising: if you're a sports guy, you'll noticed DKNG is fucking everywhere, you cant escape it. They're all over social media and are on every fucking commercial.  They spent 77% OF THEIR [REVENUE ON MARKETING PLATFORMS LMAO](https://www.actionnetwork.com/legal-online-sports-betting/draftkings-reports-increased-revenue-marketing-2020-earnings).
* Partnerships: They currently have a partnership with the NFL, UFC, MLB, three [NBA teams](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/02/draftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F&wpcn=about&wpscn=news%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F), and they own a [Nascar](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2021/05/20/draftkings-joins-nascar-star-bubba-wallace-23xi-racing/). Not only that, but Disney (ESPN) has a 6% stake in their company, yeah the largest sports network in America owns a [6% stake of DKNG.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17950769) (dont fuck with the mouse). They also have upcoming partnerships with Dish Network, and I'm sure they have a fuck ton of other promotions on the way.
* Ease of access: you literally type it in the browser, or download an app. Deposit you wage cuck check through paypal or via debit card and within 1 hour your entire check could be gone, it's that easy.
* UI: You know how everyone says, ""oh don't use robinhood, it's bad, it's so cancer, they sell your data."" Shut the fuck up, you know that UI is fucking sexy and that's why you keep buying FDs that's the same shit with DKNG. I've used hundreds of online casinos and sportsbook, personally bovada is my go to, but for legal books, DraftKings is by far the best, no question. That platform is sexy, look how clean this is compared to fanduel.

[dark mode. NICE COCK](https://preview.redd.it/izc1z4433w071.jpg?width=994&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb103c557913ee7284b132ddabaa2254c62518fc)

[disgusting light mode??? wtf is this trash LMAO. srs?](https://preview.redd.it/o1b0ydg43w071.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d690151a2c8518715623b5e8770eaf2b99d1aa2)

**WEAKNESSES:**

* They care too much, and try to hard to make as much money as possible? wtf? you thought imma drop actual weaknesses, imma straight shill. No thanks LMAO. Fan Duel, Barstool sportsbook is straight trash. dafuq.

**OPPORTUNITIES:**

* State Legalizations, currently there are only 24 states where sportsbooks, igaming is legal, but it's expected to be legal nationwide in the next 1-3 years. Maryland, Nevada, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and New York are on the brink of having DKNG in their states. I know a few of those states legalize literally just last week.
* Partnerships, with the amount of money DraftKings is spending, they're going to have deals with the NHL, NBA and possibly even some college ball in the next few months. I wouldn't be surprised to see DKNG become the official sportsbook of the NFL in the future. I know a few [stadiums](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.giants.com/news/draftkings-and-new-york-giants-announce-official-exclusive-sports-betting-deal) offer DKNG sportsbook in stadium, and I think this will become the norm in the next few years. You'll be able to go to a ballpark, stadium and place your bet directly there right next to your $40 beer (cause inflation).
* Social Media. I think where it stands right now, if you google DraftKings, their social media platform is okay, but in the next few months, especially near NFL season, it'll absolutely explode. They obviously have a facebook, twitter accounts, instagram and they are extremely interactive, they have daily podcasts and shit, but that's all so new. Their accounts are all growing, and I know as their social media presence becomes established, their brand name will grow as well.
* Buyouts, again, as a I said above Disney has a 6% stake in DKNG, I wouldn't be surprised to see Disney too onto their ownership and possible even buyout Draft Kings, I mean, imagine that. Disney, ESPN and DraftKings, all under the same parent company. That would be insane. You don't see Barstool (Penn), or Fanduel with that kind of opportunity.
* Igaming, I think this platform is so slept on. Virtual casinos are the fucking future, let me tell you, I've been doing this shit for years and once you legal bros get into this shit, you'll be hooked. There's absolutely nothing better than sitting your fat ass on the couch and blowing through hundreds of dollars betting martingale on black 7 times in a row. SHIT IS FUCKING GREAT. If they can develop a strong Igaming presence, they'll be loaded. Igaming is \~$[250 billion industry](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/gaming-market-2020-2025-size-share-trends-growth-value-and-research-report-2021-03-03?tesla=y#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,Mobile)

**THREATS:**

* Their only threat is competition, which is actually a strength because their competition is dog water. Barstool Sports can't get a partnership with the largest revenue sport, the NFL, because the NFL commish Roger Goodell absolutely hates the face of Barstool, aka Portnoy. I love Portnoy, but guy is a week away from some fucked up-cocaine induced canceling, I'm telling you. Barstool will entertain the stoolies, but they'll never become the Mcdonalds of fastfood, they'll always be the fucking nasty ass trash Burger King that you have to go to because the Mcdonalds line is too long. Fanduel is owned by a UK company, what do they know about American sports. WHAT COMPETITION.

Their revenue has absolutely gone bananas in Q1, which is fucking insane, because there were some rumors that DKNG lost a fuck ton of money from the [superbowl](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nhbr.com/the-brady-effect-new-hampshire-lottery-sacked-in-super-bowl-betting/#:~:text=State%20takes%20a%20%243%20million,the%20Bucs%20and%20their%20QB&text=While%20New%20Englanders%20bet%20heavily,hole%20on%20Super%20Bowl%20Sunday). Anyway, as you can see their revenue grew a dick-ton. The big scary here is their net is horrible, why, the big no no? Sales and Marketing. I was worried about that too, but that's their game plan, to a spend a fuck ton of money to game market dominance early on, retention rate is key to this industry. Jason Robbins their CEO said it on a [podcast the other day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93aGVyZXRoZW1vbmV5aXMubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/Nzg3ZDM1Y2QtMTgxYS00ODBhLTllZGMtMzFmZDdlNWNlMTIx?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwisjdvGtt7wAhWKUt8KHVAoCCkQjrkEegQIBBAI&ep=6), they're in preseason, training camp in this market. They're still warming up to the full opportunity.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/draftkings-reports-first-quarter-2021-results-and-raises-2021](https://preview.redd.it/4w1istie3w071.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=6116ae4857dac73c83688feb1796471896cdaac8)

So to touch upon their spending again, as you can see their spending is working. They gained new degens at a rate of 114% compared to the first quarter of 2020. INSANE GROWTH. They're growing and retaining rates at a crazy level.

[more good. less bad.](https://preview.redd.it/ezqljieg3w071.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=690df56ebd62a93b9ec73feaad69223f02f07997)

tl;dr REVENUE PUMP. They're expected to blow revenue out of the water, shit is going full parabolic. Raising revenue guidance to $1.15 billion,

[25&#37; of the population](https://preview.redd.it/3qlsfe9i3w071.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=ada7e5758aa5e16c10bb0f90170e996b885bade9)

DKNG only has access to 25% of the U.S. population as of right now, and the stock is at what $45, what till this shit nation wide.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/static-files\/4d3d4ba2-b2e0-4081-bb6c-7c74f6cc2145](https://preview.redd.it/em8i3xik3w071.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2f7b6e7ce522ac05036a0084169e95c014b7bd9)

No dilution until $135 a share, and you aren't buying this absolute diamond right now? wtf.

&#x200B;

**Price Targets**

[https:\/\/www.tipranks.com\/stocks\/dkng\/forecast](https://preview.redd.it/r13pqcbp3w071.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=47959e0448a1ab6c6b30b2488d8814b7df3ccb69)

DKNG is sitting pretty right above their low price target at $42.00, and you aint buying? Look at these price targets, a ceiling of $105.

&#x200B;

**Institutional Ownership**

[Disney](https://preview.redd.it/fpk8uzlr3w071.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=377c457af3927b4d7ff5396d147235738138e07a)

[Blackcock Inc.](https://preview.redd.it/b05q4vts3w071.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd5f5c248309093f4ab4d64b8c79fdd8e4d35493)

Look at the dates of filing and values. A lot of the media is shitting on Cathie Woods for buying DKNG religiously, but nobody is shitting on BlackRock for owning over 8million shares. As a wise man once told man, BlackRock is the United States testicles, they are the balls of this country. If they buy something, you know that shit is going to cum to the moon. It's insane how many of these big names are buying right now.

**Technical Analysis** so I hate to be the guy, but this is the [only stock I've traded all year](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/).

SHORT TERM(1-3 months):

[wedge, no vol.](https://preview.redd.it/ueoiofxw3w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=0806df6ce5521a17081b3a632be2b02361c355e4)

As you can see from the chart above, we're currently trading in between the 7d sma and 50d sma on the 2hr. This is most likely complete confirmation bias, but I backed tested when DKNG has a daily closed inbetween this same crunch since it drooped the spac name, and whenever it has this same set up, these are the next day, and or two day returns.

02/10 +10.48% , 03/04 +13.89% , 03/25 +1.62% , 07/16 +9.46% , 09/09 +9.11% , 11/05 +9.05% , 1/08/21 +4.48% ,3/10/21 +11.48% , 04/26/21 +1.91%

Try it yourself. This is actually the reason why I bought weeklies eod friday. Check my positions at the top. I think in the next few weeks, DKNG will go to that top level resistance line at \~49.5, and then it could trade sideways for a bit longer to fill that volume gap from 44.5 to 49.5, but I do think a pump day is coming nonetheless.

&#x200B;

LONG TERM(3-12 months):

[Support \/ Meme Line](https://preview.redd.it/014ln9o04w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=845d45afafea0c86a25b60729e5039fb328d1c45)

[RSI oversold](https://preview.redd.it/lsnl6oo34w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=f843db525edb8cac78c82849e727b6dac367a342)

[MACD reversal](https://preview.redd.it/o62fqra44w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=f65a6cc9e82f4f82abc03614eebe3d34d9a3b34b)

So, longterm (3-12 month window), referring to the chart at the top, it looks like DKNG has found support off the 35.5 bottom it hit in September, there's massive volume support at the 42.5 line, and that looks to be the new floor (god forbid a market crash happens soon, plz no fomc june 18th taper tantrum). It looks like the next major test for DKNG is at the 200d SMA or 51.52. If you look at RSI, it's leaving oversold territory, and MACD is flashing a reversal. I think we're due for a next wave of highs on DKNG. I could see this popping to \~49.5-51.5 -> \~60 -> all time highs. TA is looking dumb bullish you fucking idiots. Buy this shit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**CONCLUSION**

in conclusion, I fucking love the stock. Technical and Fundamentals showing a strong buy. Dick Kings is about to cum, and be sure you're there to catch the cum, because once this thing is near it's edge, it's going to absolute nut. I know I wont want to miss suc.. am I gay? anyway. buy dkng.

TL;DR I might be gay now, but buy DKNG, Shit looks like an absolute steal. Later nerds **$DKNG 100c 1/21/22** [POSITIONS HERE I AM AUTISTIC](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://imgur.com/gallery/7ZK85CN)",njaa8g,Why I'm Large and in Charge for Dick Kings (DKNG)

It's rather shocking to me that most people have never heard of ImmunityBio - IBRX in the biotech space.  They have this new drug called Anktiva could be a new cancer drug for a wide range of cancers. Not just one type but looks to be for mutliple types of cancers based on the study.  Seems like the side-effects are minimal.  Only downside I see from the study is that it's only a phase 2 trial of 140 patients so it's not as wide-ranging as a phase 3 study.  Although, Anktiva got a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in another phase 3 study.  So FDA approval could be on the horizon since a phase 3 was done for bladder cancer. 

But apparently according to the phase 2 study, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. . Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda).  Could be hope for those who have failed previous treatments for various solid tumors.   If you know of anyone that has cancer and has failed or is failing treatment(s), I would call up IBRX and try to get in a study.

I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I've consumed lately.
&nbsp;


##Let‚Äôs start with a look at overall market performance by sector

I like to use this to establish a point of reference - _what_ kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly?

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/cV2n4du)

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD](https://imgur.com/LrgETAx)

I‚Äôm using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that‚Äôs a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year‚Äôs growth trade has lagged and given back.

##Now let‚Äôs look at index performance:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/eaDWp9s)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/iGGKKee)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/57uD3Ue)

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.   
**Take-Aways**  

- Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce, seemingly fueled by panic-buying at the Thursday open.  
- The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces; for SPY the 50DMA has held, QQQ support at 316.  
- Despite the recent volatility, we have no had a significant drawdown; we're still close to ATHs on these indices, and specifically I look at QQQ's chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year.
- IWM appears to have formed a range, which I‚Äôd say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March. This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value (shown below) that started around this time. This chart is something to watch - if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run. 

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected ETFs 1y](https://imgur.com/kkdbTmk)

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

**Conjecture**  

- You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop: we‚Äôve held some established support and bounced nicely so hard to see us really breaking down further, alternatively we‚Äôve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between, which could be a sign of weakening  and indication of possible further downside.
- Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets. With the growing proliferation of the latter, we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on/with equities (or other) markets. If a bubble is bursting here, does it signal a growing risk-off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well? 


##Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year

I'm just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading; this is what I have in mind _right now_, but all of this can change in an instant of course: 

**Summer -** expecting the reflation trade (financials, energy, industrials, value) to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform.

**June FOMC -** There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here‚Ä¶ or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting.

**August Jackson Hole Meetup -** If we haven‚Äôt heard anything regarding tapering prior, speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change, as that‚Äôs what happened last year with inflation targeting. With fear of a taper tantrum, we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this.

**Late Summer -** If we haven‚Äôt had one by now, I‚Äôd expect a meaningful (10%) pullback. 

**Inflation Data -** June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes, but if we continue to get high prints into July, August, and later this year, inflation will become a real issue.

**Fall -** We start to get murky here. I‚Äôd look for a late-year rally to follow any pullback, but it‚Äôs hard to say; too many unknowns. 

**EOY Targets -** CNBC‚Äôs median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800. Consider we‚Äôre already +11%, +%12, +4% YTD on SPY, IWM, and QQQ respectively, and +86%, +119%, +92% since the March 2020 lows, is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near-term?

**Considerations**
- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Consider seasonality. We‚Äôre entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It‚Äôs something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- Have long exposure, but be careful with positioning and time horizons. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit, but there is no way you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&nbsp;

I think right now if you‚Äôre long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them. 

## Bonus Charts

**Commodities Performance**

I thought it would be interesting to look at the recent performance of certain commodities in comparison with major indices:

[Select Commodities vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/fRAUEyt)

[Select Commodities ETFs vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/jH48XtQ)

Lumber‚Äôs performance slightly skews the first chart, but in both we can see well enough that a divergence starting to occur in early-mid April - something to continue to watch as it‚Äôs a correlation with the inflation narrative but more specifically the supply chain issues we‚Äôve had. 

**Comparing Recent and (Recently) Historical Index Performance**

When considering the EOY Target data and the recent performance of equities, I thought it would be interesting to scale back a little further and do some historical comparisons:

[SPY 5y](https://imgur.com/NL0qgBn)

[QQQ 5y](https://imgur.com/aMIv0Xc)

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I‚Äôm big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I‚Äôve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I‚Äôve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE‚Äôs float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE‚Äôs 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled ‚ÄúHindenburg MVIS‚Äù and the second article that popped up was titled ‚ÄúTechnically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.‚Äù This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE‚Äôs pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg‚Äôs attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM‚Äôs investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that ‚ÄúTimeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.‚Äù

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio‚Äôs Endorsement of LMC:** üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn‚Äôt mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it ‚Äú‚Äòbull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don‚Äôt get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.‚Äù

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): ‚ÄúI think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area ‚Äî Voltage Valley as we like to call it ‚Äî but all over Ohio.‚Äù

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) ‚ÄúReally, this is the future,‚Äù DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. ‚ÄúI think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.‚Äù

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he‚Äôs visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he‚Äôs seen the company‚Äôs robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he‚Äôs seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre way way way far along,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.‚Äù

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE‚ÄôS**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced ‚ÄúLordstown Week‚Äù](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.

* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you‚Äôd be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I‚Äôm planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20‚Äôs. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

3083,,2021-05-23 20:45:44,t3_njgt6i,,wallstreetbets,"I don't hold a position in $UWMC - but it seems to be buzzing on this subreddit so I thought I would provide you guys with an unbiased look at the chart. There are two charts I want to look at today.

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

[$UWMC 20 Day 2 Hour](https://preview.redd.it/titkhs0fmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=142a5763bf0da2864af7776d8e7cdb488607f00a)

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

M4: M4- +¬†T-Bills¬†(or M3 + Commercial Paper +¬†T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States¬†Federal Reserve¬†published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people‚Äôs saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People‚Äôs deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

3086,,2021-05-23 21:05:18,t3_njh97r,,wallstreetbets,"Alright retards, I'm in here with a little bit of weekend DD. ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.
3087,,2021-05-23 22:13:52,t3_njipr1,,wallstreetbets,"Liquified natural gas, LNG, is one of the world's fastest growing fuel sources. Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares.

See chart link below from the mattress king indicating previous secondaries and subsequent recoveries.

I believe that with the back drop of a very positive earnings report, raised guidance, and a non dilutive secondary offering that there is significant catalyst to propel PRPL back to the mid to high 30's and potentially all time high of low 40s. I expect a steep climb over the next few weeks.

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth?

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Don't think I need to say anything here. It's pretty obvious that there could be a very sharp rebound from the trendline soon enough

Advice: don't play this short term or you'll get bruned, markets can stay irrational for a long time. Just hold shares, maybe with 2:1 leverage if you are brave.

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

3146,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

It's rather shocking to me that most people have never heard of ImmunityBio - IBRX in the biotech space.  They have this new drug called Anktiva could be a new cancer drug for a wide range of cancers. Not just one type but looks to be for mutliple types of cancers based on the study.  Seems like the side-effects are minimal.  Only downside I see from the study is that it's only a phase 2 trial of 140 patients so it's not as wide-ranging as a phase 3 study.  Although, Anktiva got a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in another phase 3 study.  So FDA approval could be on the horizon since a phase 3 was done for bladder cancer. 

But apparently according to the phase 2 study, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. . Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda).  Could be hope for those who have failed previous treatments for various solid tumors.   If you know of anyone that has cancer and has failed or is failing treatment(s), I would call up IBRX and try to get in a study.

I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I've consumed lately.
&nbsp;


##Let‚Äôs start with a look at overall market performance by sector

I like to use this to establish a point of reference - _what_ kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly?

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/cV2n4du)

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD](https://imgur.com/LrgETAx)

I‚Äôm using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that‚Äôs a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year‚Äôs growth trade has lagged and given back.

##Now let‚Äôs look at index performance:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/eaDWp9s)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/iGGKKee)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/57uD3Ue)

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.   
**Take-Aways**  

- Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce, seemingly fueled by panic-buying at the Thursday open.  
- The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces; for SPY the 50DMA has held, QQQ support at 316.  
- Despite the recent volatility, we have no had a significant drawdown; we're still close to ATHs on these indices, and specifically I look at QQQ's chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year.
- IWM appears to have formed a range, which I‚Äôd say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March. This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value (shown below) that started around this time. This chart is something to watch - if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run. 

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected ETFs 1y](https://imgur.com/kkdbTmk)

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

**Conjecture**  

- You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop: we‚Äôve held some established support and bounced nicely so hard to see us really breaking down further, alternatively we‚Äôve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between, which could be a sign of weakening  and indication of possible further downside.
- Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets. With the growing proliferation of the latter, we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on/with equities (or other) markets. If a bubble is bursting here, does it signal a growing risk-off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well? 


##Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year

I'm just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading; this is what I have in mind _right now_, but all of this can change in an instant of course: 

**Summer -** expecting the reflation trade (financials, energy, industrials, value) to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform.

**June FOMC -** There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here‚Ä¶ or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting.

**August Jackson Hole Meetup -** If we haven‚Äôt heard anything regarding tapering prior, speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change, as that‚Äôs what happened last year with inflation targeting. With fear of a taper tantrum, we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this.

**Late Summer -** If we haven‚Äôt had one by now, I‚Äôd expect a meaningful (10%) pullback. 

**Inflation Data -** June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes, but if we continue to get high prints into July, August, and later this year, inflation will become a real issue.

**Fall -** We start to get murky here. I‚Äôd look for a late-year rally to follow any pullback, but it‚Äôs hard to say; too many unknowns. 

**EOY Targets -** CNBC‚Äôs median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800. Consider we‚Äôre already +11%, +%12, +4% YTD on SPY, IWM, and QQQ respectively, and +86%, +119%, +92% since the March 2020 lows, is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near-term?

**Considerations**
- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Consider seasonality. We‚Äôre entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It‚Äôs something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- Have long exposure, but be careful with positioning and time horizons. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit, but there is no way you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&nbsp;

I think right now if you‚Äôre long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them. 

## Bonus Charts

**Commodities Performance**

I thought it would be interesting to look at the recent performance of certain commodities in comparison with major indices:

[Select Commodities vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/fRAUEyt)

[Select Commodities ETFs vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/jH48XtQ)

Lumber‚Äôs performance slightly skews the first chart, but in both we can see well enough that a divergence starting to occur in early-mid April - something to continue to watch as it‚Äôs a correlation with the inflation narrative but more specifically the supply chain issues we‚Äôve had. 

**Comparing Recent and (Recently) Historical Index Performance**

When considering the EOY Target data and the recent performance of equities, I thought it would be interesting to scale back a little further and do some historical comparisons:

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I‚Äôm big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I‚Äôve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I‚Äôve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE‚Äôs float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE‚Äôs 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled ‚ÄúHindenburg MVIS‚Äù and the second article that popped up was titled ‚ÄúTechnically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.‚Äù This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE‚Äôs pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg‚Äôs attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM‚Äôs investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that ‚ÄúTimeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.‚Äù

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio‚Äôs Endorsement of LMC:** üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn‚Äôt mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it ‚Äú‚Äòbull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don‚Äôt get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.‚Äù

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): ‚ÄúI think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area ‚Äî Voltage Valley as we like to call it ‚Äî but all over Ohio.‚Äù

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) ‚ÄúReally, this is the future,‚Äù DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. ‚ÄúI think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.‚Äù

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he‚Äôs visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he‚Äôs seen the company‚Äôs robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he‚Äôs seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre way way way far along,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.‚Äù

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE‚ÄôS**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced ‚ÄúLordstown Week‚Äù](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.
* [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now).
* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you‚Äôd be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I‚Äôm planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20‚Äôs. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

[$UWMC 20 Day 2 Hour](https://preview.redd.it/titkhs0fmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=142a5763bf0da2864af7776d8e7cdb488607f00a)

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

3585,,2021-05-23 21:04:15,t3_njh8a7,,wallstreetbets,"Money¬†is used as a¬†medium of exchange, and as a¬†store of value.

In money supply statistics, central bank money is¬†MB¬†while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3¬†components. Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of¬†M1,¬†while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as¬†M2¬†and¬†M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of¬†currency in circulation¬†and¬†checking account¬†balances.
M2: M1 + most¬†savings accounts,¬†money market accounts, retail¬†money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit¬†of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other¬†CDs¬†(large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of¬†eurodollars¬†and¬†repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 +¬†Commercial Paper
M4: M4- +¬†T-Bills¬†(or M3 + Commercial Paper +¬†T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States¬†Federal Reserve¬†published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people‚Äôs saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People‚Äôs deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

Recently the company became debt free and is in the process of finalizing commercial deals with buyers.  These deals will be announced within a few weeks according to their CEO. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares. There has been several secondaries over the past 18 month and the price action has generally been a significant pullback then an aggressive rebound. We are at the bottom of the pullback right now.  See chart link below from the mattress king indicating previous secondaries and subsequent recoveries.

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth?

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding.

3596,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

3646,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

**DraftKings** is an American daily fantasy sports contest (dfs), sports betting operator (sportsbook), and virtual casino platform (igaming). Essentially it's a fucking money pit for retards who have gambling addictions, and according to a [Harvard Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230631/#:~:text=Based%20on%20its%20analysis%20of,activities%20in%20the%20past%20year) conducted in fucking 1997, approximately 1% of adults have gambling addictions, I'm sure with todays ease of access, it's more like 2%, so, \~6.6 million retards are at severe risk to giving DraftKings their bank accounts. Like I said, this shit is a money pit, they provide a service that results in LITERAL FREE MONEY. Instead of driving to a casino, these geniuses at DraftKings are allowing some individuals to gamble from the comfort of their couch, it's amazing. Also, when I say retards, take that lightly last Saturday, I gambled away, and streamed myself in an undisclosed off-brand WSB discord, $500 in an online casino, and gamble on sports, daily, hell, last NFL season I finished first in the r/sportsbook betting contest. [PROOF (i love gambling)](https://imgur.com/gallery/woD8Vpu). With that said, if you like something buy it, if you love something invest in it. I love gambling, and will invest in the BEST *legal* sports book out there, DKNG, aka Donkey Kong, aka Donkey Dick, aka Dick Kings. :kek:

**SWOT ANALYSIS of Dick Kings**

**STRENGTHS:**

* Industry leaders: currently DKNG is legal in more [states](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/help/sports-betting/where-is-sports-betting-legal?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2Fhelp%2Fsports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal&wpcn=help&wpscn=sports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal) than any other sportsbook platform, they're legal in 11, with 2 on the brink of legalization, and a window of opportunity by eoy for the remaining 11 states where it is legal.
* Marketing/Advertising: if you're a sports guy, you'll noticed DKNG is fucking everywhere, you cant escape it. They're all over social media and are on every fucking commercial.  They spent 77% OF THEIR [REVENUE ON MARKETING PLATFORMS LMAO](https://www.actionnetwork.com/legal-online-sports-betting/draftkings-reports-increased-revenue-marketing-2020-earnings).
* Partnerships: They currently have a partnership with the NFL, UFC, MLB, three [NBA teams](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/02/draftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F&wpcn=about&wpscn=news%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F), and they own a [Nascar](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2021/05/20/draftkings-joins-nascar-star-bubba-wallace-23xi-racing/). Not only that, but Disney (ESPN) has a 6% stake in their company, yeah the largest sports network in America owns a [6% stake of DKNG.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17950769) (dont fuck with the mouse). They also have upcoming partnerships with Dish Network, and I'm sure they have a fuck ton of other promotions on the way.
* Ease of access: you literally type it in the browser, or download an app. Deposit you wage cuck check through paypal or via debit card and within 1 hour your entire check could be gone, it's that easy.
* UI: You know how everyone says, ""oh don't use robinhood, it's bad, it's so cancer, they sell your data."" Shut the fuck up, you know that UI is fucking sexy and that's why you keep buying FDs that's the same shit with DKNG. I've used hundreds of online casinos and sportsbook, personally bovada is my go to, but for legal books, DraftKings is by far the best, no question. That platform is sexy, look how clean this is compared to fanduel.

[dark mode. NICE COCK](https://preview.redd.it/izc1z4433w071.jpg?width=994&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb103c557913ee7284b132ddabaa2254c62518fc)

[disgusting light mode??? wtf is this trash LMAO. srs?](https://preview.redd.it/o1b0ydg43w071.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d690151a2c8518715623b5e8770eaf2b99d1aa2)

**WEAKNESSES:**

* They care too much, and try to hard to make as much money as possible? wtf? you thought imma drop actual weaknesses, imma straight shill. No thanks LMAO. Fan Duel, Barstool sportsbook is straight trash. dafuq.

**OPPORTUNITIES:**

* State Legalizations, currently there are only 24 states where sportsbooks, igaming is legal, but it's expected to be legal nationwide in the next 1-3 years. Maryland, Nevada, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and New York are on the brink of having DKNG in their states. I know a few of those states legalize literally just last week.
* Partnerships, with the amount of money DraftKings is spending, they're going to have deals with the NHL, NBA and possibly even some college ball in the next few months. I wouldn't be surprised to see DKNG become the official sportsbook of the NFL in the future. I know a few [stadiums](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.giants.com/news/draftkings-and-new-york-giants-announce-official-exclusive-sports-betting-deal) offer DKNG sportsbook in stadium, and I think this will become the norm in the next few years. You'll be able to go to a ballpark, stadium and place your bet directly there right next to your $40 beer (cause inflation).
* Social Media. I think where it stands right now, if you google DraftKings, their social media platform is okay, but in the next few months, especially near NFL season, it'll absolutely explode. They obviously have a facebook, twitter accounts, instagram and they are extremely interactive, they have daily podcasts and shit, but that's all so new. Their accounts are all growing, and I know as their social media presence becomes established, their brand name will grow as well.
* Buyouts, again, as a I said above Disney has a 6% stake in DKNG, I wouldn't be surprised to see Disney too onto their ownership and possible even buyout Draft Kings, I mean, imagine that. Disney, ESPN and DraftKings, all under the same parent company. That would be insane. You don't see Barstool (Penn), or Fanduel with that kind of opportunity.
* Igaming, I think this platform is so slept on. Virtual casinos are the fucking future, let me tell you, I've been doing this shit for years and once you legal bros get into this shit, you'll be hooked. There's absolutely nothing better than sitting your fat ass on the couch and blowing through hundreds of dollars betting martingale on black 7 times in a row. SHIT IS FUCKING GREAT. If they can develop a strong Igaming presence, they'll be loaded. Igaming is \~$[250 billion industry](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/gaming-market-2020-2025-size-share-trends-growth-value-and-research-report-2021-03-03?tesla=y#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,Mobile)

**THREATS:**

* Their only threat is competition, which is actually a strength because their competition is dog water. Barstool Sports can't get a partnership with the largest revenue sport, the NFL, because the NFL commish Roger Goodell absolutely hates the face of Barstool, aka Portnoy. I love Portnoy, but guy is a week away from some fucked up-cocaine induced canceling, I'm telling you. Barstool will entertain the stoolies, but they'll never become the Mcdonalds of fastfood, they'll always be the fucking nasty ass trash Burger King that you have to go to because the Mcdonalds line is too long. Fanduel is owned by a UK company, what do they know about American sports. WHAT COMPETITION.

Their revenue has absolutely gone bananas in Q1, which is fucking insane, because there were some rumors that DKNG lost a fuck ton of money from the [superbowl](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nhbr.com/the-brady-effect-new-hampshire-lottery-sacked-in-super-bowl-betting/#:~:text=State%20takes%20a%20%243%20million,the%20Bucs%20and%20their%20QB&text=While%20New%20Englanders%20bet%20heavily,hole%20on%20Super%20Bowl%20Sunday). Anyway, as you can see their revenue grew a dick-ton. The big scary here is their net is horrible, why, the big no no? Sales and Marketing. I was worried about that too, but that's their game plan, to a spend a fuck ton of money to game market dominance early on, retention rate is key to this industry. Jason Robbins their CEO said it on a [podcast the other day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93aGVyZXRoZW1vbmV5aXMubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/Nzg3ZDM1Y2QtMTgxYS00ODBhLTllZGMtMzFmZDdlNWNlMTIx?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwisjdvGtt7wAhWKUt8KHVAoCCkQjrkEegQIBBAI&ep=6), they're in preseason, training camp in this market. They're still warming up to the full opportunity.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/draftkings-reports-first-quarter-2021-results-and-raises-2021](https://preview.redd.it/4w1istie3w071.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=6116ae4857dac73c83688feb1796471896cdaac8)

So to touch upon their spending again, as you can see their spending is working. They gained new degens at a rate of 114% compared to the first quarter of 2020. INSANE GROWTH. They're growing and retaining rates at a crazy level.

[more good. less bad.](https://preview.redd.it/ezqljieg3w071.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=690df56ebd62a93b9ec73feaad69223f02f07997)

tl;dr REVENUE PUMP. They're expected to blow revenue out of the water, shit is going full parabolic. Raising revenue guidance to $1.15 billion,

[25&#37; of the population](https://preview.redd.it/3qlsfe9i3w071.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=ada7e5758aa5e16c10bb0f90170e996b885bade9)

DKNG only has access to 25% of the U.S. population as of right now, and the stock is at what $45, what till this shit nation wide.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/static-files\/4d3d4ba2-b2e0-4081-bb6c-7c74f6cc2145](https://preview.redd.it/em8i3xik3w071.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2f7b6e7ce522ac05036a0084169e95c014b7bd9)

No dilution until $135 a share, and you aren't buying this absolute diamond right now? wtf.

&#x200B;

**Price Targets**

[https:\/\/www.tipranks.com\/stocks\/dkng\/forecast](https://preview.redd.it/r13pqcbp3w071.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=47959e0448a1ab6c6b30b2488d8814b7df3ccb69)

DKNG is sitting pretty right above their low price target at $42.00, and you aint buying? Look at these price targets, a ceiling of $105.

&#x200B;

**Institutional Ownership**

[Disney](https://preview.redd.it/fpk8uzlr3w071.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=377c457af3927b4d7ff5396d147235738138e07a)

Look at the dates of filing and values. A lot of the media is shitting on Cathie Woods for buying DKNG religiously, but nobody is shitting on BlackRock for owning over 8million shares. As a wise man once told man, BlackRock is the United States testicles, they are the balls of this country. If they buy something, you know that shit is going to cum to the moon. It's insane how many of these big names are buying right now.

**Technical Analysis** so I hate to be the guy, but this is the [only stock I've traded all year](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/).

SHORT TERM(1-3 months):

As you can see from the chart above, we're currently trading in between the 7d sma and 50d sma on the 2hr. This is most likely complete confirmation bias, but I backed tested when DKNG has a daily closed inbetween this same crunch since it drooped the spac name, and whenever it has this same set up, these are the next day, and or two day returns.

02/10 +10.48% , 03/04 +13.89% , 03/25 +1.62% , 07/16 +9.46% , 09/09 +9.11% , 11/05 +9.05% , 1/08/21 +4.48% ,3/10/21 +11.48% , 04/26/21 +1.91%

Try it yourself. This is actually the reason why I bought weeklies eod friday. Check my positions at the top. I think in the next few weeks, DKNG will go to that top level resistance line at \~49.5, and then it could trade sideways for a bit longer to fill that volume gap from 44.5 to 49.5, but I do think a pump day is coming nonetheless.

So, longterm (3-12 month window), referring to the chart at the top, it looks like DKNG has found support off the 35.5 bottom it hit in September, there's massive volume support at the 42.5 line, and that looks to be the new floor (god forbid a market crash happens soon, plz no fomc june 18th taper tantrum). It looks like the next major test for DKNG is at the 200d SMA or 51.52. If you look at RSI, it's leaving oversold territory, and MACD is flashing a reversal. I think we're due for a next wave of highs on DKNG. I could see this popping to \~49.5-51.5 -> \~60 -> all time highs. TA is looking dumb bullish you fucking idiots. Buy this shit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**CONCLUSION**

in conclusion, I fucking love the stock. Technical and Fundamentals showing a strong buy. Dick Kings is about to cum, and be sure you're there to catch the cum, because once this thing is near it's edge, it's going to absolute nut. I know I wont want to miss suc.. am I gay? anyway. buy dkng.

It's rather shocking to me that most people have never heard of ImmunityBio - IBRX in the biotech space.  They have this new drug called Anktiva could be a new cancer drug for a wide range of cancers. Not just one type but looks to be for mutliple types of cancers based on the study.  Seems like the side-effects are minimal.  Only downside I see from the study is that it's only a phase 2 trial of 140 patients so it's not as wide-ranging as a phase 3 study.  Although, Anktiva got a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in another phase 3 study.  So FDA approval could be on the horizon since a phase 3 was done for bladder cancer. 

But apparently according to the phase 2 study, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. . Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda).  Could be hope for those who have failed previous treatments for various solid tumors.   If you know of anyone that has cancer and has failed or is failing treatment(s), I would call up IBRX and try to get in a study.

I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I've consumed lately.
&nbsp;


##Let‚Äôs start with a look at overall market performance by sector

I like to use this to establish a point of reference - _what_ kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly?

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/cV2n4du)

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD](https://imgur.com/LrgETAx)

I‚Äôm using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that‚Äôs a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year‚Äôs growth trade has lagged and given back.

##Now let‚Äôs look at index performance:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/eaDWp9s)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/iGGKKee)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/57uD3Ue)

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.   
**Take-Aways**  

- Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce, seemingly fueled by panic-buying at the Thursday open.  
- The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces; for SPY the 50DMA has held, QQQ support at 316.  
- Despite the recent volatility, we have no had a significant drawdown; we're still close to ATHs on these indices, and specifically I look at QQQ's chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year.
- IWM appears to have formed a range, which I‚Äôd say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March. This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value (shown below) that started around this time. This chart is something to watch - if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run. 

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected ETFs 1y](https://imgur.com/kkdbTmk)

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

**Conjecture**  

- You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop: we‚Äôve held some established support and bounced nicely so hard to see us really breaking down further, alternatively we‚Äôve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between, which could be a sign of weakening  and indication of possible further downside.
- Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets. With the growing proliferation of the latter, we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on/with equities (or other) markets. If a bubble is bursting here, does it signal a growing risk-off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well? 


##Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year

I'm just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading; this is what I have in mind _right now_, but all of this can change in an instant of course: 

**Summer -** expecting the reflation trade (financials, energy, industrials, value) to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform.

**June FOMC -** There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here‚Ä¶ or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting.

**August Jackson Hole Meetup -** If we haven‚Äôt heard anything regarding tapering prior, speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change, as that‚Äôs what happened last year with inflation targeting. With fear of a taper tantrum, we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this.

**Late Summer -** If we haven‚Äôt had one by now, I‚Äôd expect a meaningful (10%) pullback. 

**Inflation Data -** June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes, but if we continue to get high prints into July, August, and later this year, inflation will become a real issue.

**Fall -** We start to get murky here. I‚Äôd look for a late-year rally to follow any pullback, but it‚Äôs hard to say; too many unknowns. 

**EOY Targets -** CNBC‚Äôs median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800. Consider we‚Äôre already +11%, +%12, +4% YTD on SPY, IWM, and QQQ respectively, and +86%, +119%, +92% since the March 2020 lows, is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near-term?

**Considerations**
- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Consider seasonality. We‚Äôre entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It‚Äôs something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- Have long exposure, but be careful with positioning and time horizons. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit, but there is no way you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&nbsp;

I think right now if you‚Äôre long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them. 

## Bonus Charts

**Commodities Performance**

I thought it would be interesting to look at the recent performance of certain commodities in comparison with major indices:

[Select Commodities vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/fRAUEyt)

[Select Commodities ETFs vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/jH48XtQ)

Lumber‚Äôs performance slightly skews the first chart, but in both we can see well enough that a divergence starting to occur in early-mid April - something to continue to watch as it‚Äôs a correlation with the inflation narrative but more specifically the supply chain issues we‚Äôve had. 

**Comparing Recent and (Recently) Historical Index Performance**

When considering the EOY Target data and the recent performance of equities, I thought it would be interesting to scale back a little further and do some historical comparisons:

[SPY 5y](https://imgur.com/NL0qgBn)

[QQQ 5y](https://imgur.com/aMIv0Xc)

[IWM 5y](https://imgur.com/LhEheTy)

From a low of 198.65 on 28 Jun 2016 to the pre-covid high of 338.12 on 10 Feb 2020, the SPY went up ~70%.  
We can look at the yearly breakdown:  

[SPY, Yearly % Returns](https://imgur.com/mSTSsLh) ([source](https://www.macrotrends.net/2526/sp-500-historical-annual-returns))

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I‚Äôm big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I‚Äôve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I‚Äôve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE‚Äôs float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE‚Äôs 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled ‚ÄúHindenburg MVIS‚Äù and the second article that popped up was titled ‚ÄúTechnically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.‚Äù This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE‚Äôs pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg‚Äôs attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM‚Äôs investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that ‚ÄúTimeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.‚Äù

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

He called it ‚Äú‚Äòbull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo.

Based on what he‚Äôs seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre way way way far along,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.‚Äù

They also [recently announced ‚ÄúLordstown Week‚Äù](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.

* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you‚Äôd be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I‚Äôm planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20‚Äôs. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

[$UWMC 20 Day 2 Hour](https://preview.redd.it/titkhs0fmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=142a5763bf0da2864af7776d8e7cdb488607f00a)

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

3970,,2021-05-23 21:04:15,t3_njh8a7,,wallstreetbets,"Money¬†is used as a¬†medium of exchange, and as a¬†store of value.

In money supply statistics, central bank money is¬†MB¬†while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3¬†components. Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of¬†M1,¬†while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as¬†M2¬†and¬†M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of¬†currency in circulation¬†and¬†checking account¬†balances.
M2: M1 + most¬†savings accounts,¬†money market accounts, retail¬†money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit¬†of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other¬†CDs¬†(large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of¬†eurodollars¬†and¬†repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 +¬†Commercial Paper
M4: M4- +¬†T-Bills¬†(or M3 + Commercial Paper +¬†T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States¬†Federal Reserve¬†published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people‚Äôs saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People‚Äôs deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.
3972,,2021-05-23 22:13:52,t3_njipr1,,wallstreetbets,"Liquified natural gas, LNG, is one of the world's fastest growing fuel sources. Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth? This new product is quite impressive and going to be a key thing to keep an eye on because [they want to spin-off Kbank and the current estimated value is about $7 billion dollars](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html).

I believe Korean analysts are conservative, so to see headlines like this for a major company is interesting).

&#x200B;

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding. With a TTM net income of nearly 700 million dollars, a 50% dividend payout ratio and multiple high growth opportunities, why is it only valued at 7.4 billion dollars?

3981,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.

That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

4030,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

I am sure they priced in loss revenues from adjusting their delivery distances, but they will most likely make up for it in the cost savings by merging the apps.   


Plus, the value in Uber is the re-opening play. Once their rides business picks up, with a sustained Eats division, expect them to hit profitability by EOY. They shed off a lot of their moon-shots divisions, and have great investments on the balance sheets.

Seems like the side-effects are minimal.  Only downside I see from the study is that it's only a phase 2 trial of 140 patients so it's not as wide-ranging as a phase 3 study.  Although, Anktiva got a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in another phase 3 study.  So FDA approval could be on the horizon since a phase 3 was done for bladder cancer. 

But apparently according to the phase 2 study, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. . Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda).  Could be hope for those who have failed previous treatments for various solid tumors.   If you know of anyone that has cancer and has failed or is failing treatment(s), I would call up IBRX and try to get in a study.

I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I've consumed lately.
&nbsp;


##Let‚Äôs start with a look at overall market performance by sector

I like to use this to establish a point of reference - _what_ kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly?

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/cV2n4du)

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD](https://imgur.com/LrgETAx)

I‚Äôm using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that‚Äôs a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year‚Äôs growth trade has lagged and given back.

##Now let‚Äôs look at index performance:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/eaDWp9s)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/iGGKKee)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/57uD3Ue)

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.   
**Take-Aways**  

- Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce, seemingly fueled by panic-buying at the Thursday open.  
- The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces; for SPY the 50DMA has held, QQQ support at 316.  
- Despite the recent volatility, we have no had a significant drawdown; we're still close to ATHs on these indices, and specifically I look at QQQ's chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year.
- IWM appears to have formed a range, which I‚Äôd say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March. This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value (shown below) that started around this time. This chart is something to watch - if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run. 

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected ETFs 1y](https://imgur.com/kkdbTmk)

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

**Conjecture**  

- You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop: we‚Äôve held some established support and bounced nicely so hard to see us really breaking down further, alternatively we‚Äôve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between, which could be a sign of weakening  and indication of possible further downside.
- Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets. With the growing proliferation of the latter, we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on/with equities (or other) markets. If a bubble is bursting here, does it signal a growing risk-off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well? 


##Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year

I'm just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading; this is what I have in mind _right now_, but all of this can change in an instant of course: 

**Summer -** expecting the reflation trade (financials, energy, industrials, value) to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform.

**June FOMC -** There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here‚Ä¶ or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting.

**August Jackson Hole Meetup -** If we haven‚Äôt heard anything regarding tapering prior, speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change, as that‚Äôs what happened last year with inflation targeting. With fear of a taper tantrum, we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this.

**Late Summer -** If we haven‚Äôt had one by now, I‚Äôd expect a meaningful (10%) pullback. 

**Inflation Data -** June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes, but if we continue to get high prints into July, August, and later this year, inflation will become a real issue.

**Fall -** We start to get murky here. I‚Äôd look for a late-year rally to follow any pullback, but it‚Äôs hard to say; too many unknowns. 

**EOY Targets -** CNBC‚Äôs median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800. Consider we‚Äôre already +11%, +%12, +4% YTD on SPY, IWM, and QQQ respectively, and +86%, +119%, +92% since the March 2020 lows, is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near-term?

**Considerations**
- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Consider seasonality. We‚Äôre entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It‚Äôs something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- Have long exposure, but be careful with positioning and time horizons. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit, but there is no way you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&nbsp;

I think right now if you‚Äôre long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them. 

## Bonus Charts

**Commodities Performance**

I thought it would be interesting to look at the recent performance of certain commodities in comparison with major indices:

[Select Commodities vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/fRAUEyt)

[Select Commodities ETFs vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/jH48XtQ)

Lumber‚Äôs performance slightly skews the first chart, but in both we can see well enough that a divergence starting to occur in early-mid April - something to continue to watch as it‚Äôs a correlation with the inflation narrative but more specifically the supply chain issues we‚Äôve had. 

**Comparing Recent and (Recently) Historical Index Performance**

When considering the EOY Target data and the recent performance of equities, I thought it would be interesting to scale back a little further and do some historical comparisons:

[SPY 5y](https://imgur.com/NL0qgBn)

[QQQ 5y](https://imgur.com/aMIv0Xc)

From a low of 198.65 on 28 Jun 2016 to the pre-covid high of 338.12 on 10 Feb 2020, the SPY went up ~70%.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I‚Äôm big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I‚Äôve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I‚Äôve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE‚Äôs float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE‚Äôs 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled ‚ÄúHindenburg MVIS‚Äù and the second article that popped up was titled ‚ÄúTechnically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.‚Äù This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE‚Äôs pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg‚Äôs attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM‚Äôs investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that ‚ÄúTimeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.‚Äù

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio‚Äôs Endorsement of LMC:** üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn‚Äôt mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it ‚Äú‚Äòbull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don‚Äôt get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.‚Äù

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): ‚ÄúI think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area ‚Äî Voltage Valley as we like to call it ‚Äî but all over Ohio.‚Äù

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) ‚ÄúReally, this is the future,‚Äù DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. ‚ÄúI think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.‚Äù

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he‚Äôs visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he‚Äôs seen the company‚Äôs robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he‚Äôs seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre way way way far along,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.‚Äù

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE‚ÄôS**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced ‚ÄúLordstown Week‚Äù](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.

* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you‚Äôd be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I‚Äôm planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20‚Äôs. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

4249,,2021-05-23 20:45:44,t3_njgt6i,,wallstreetbets,"I don't hold a position in $UWMC - but it seems to be buzzing on this subreddit so I thought I would provide you guys with an unbiased look at the chart. There are two charts I want to look at today.

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

[$UWMC 20 Day 2 Hour](https://preview.redd.it/titkhs0fmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=142a5763bf0da2864af7776d8e7cdb488607f00a)

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

4251,,2021-05-23 21:04:15,t3_njh8a7,,wallstreetbets,"Money¬†is used as a¬†medium of exchange, and as a¬†store of value.

In money supply statistics, central bank money is¬†MB¬†while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3¬†components. Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of¬†M1,¬†while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as¬†M2¬†and¬†M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of¬†currency in circulation¬†and¬†checking account¬†balances.
M2: M1 + most¬†savings accounts,¬†money market accounts, retail¬†money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit¬†of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other¬†CDs¬†(large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of¬†eurodollars¬†and¬†repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 +¬†Commercial Paper
M4: M4- +¬†T-Bills¬†(or M3 + Commercial Paper +¬†T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States¬†Federal Reserve¬†published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people‚Äôs saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People‚Äôs deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

4252,,2021-05-23 21:05:18,t3_njh97r,,wallstreetbets,"Alright retards, I'm in here with a little bit of weekend DD. ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.
4253,,2021-05-23 22:13:52,t3_njipr1,,wallstreetbets,"Liquified natural gas, LNG, is one of the world's fastest growing fuel sources. Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI.

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well.

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth.

4262,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

4311,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

By end of the year, # of markets will be doubled from last year

For the second quarter of 2021, revenue is expected to be between **$1.025 billion and $1.075 billion,** which represents **41% sequential growth over 1Q21** at the midpoint of the expected range.

AND, Opendoor has about $**2 billion in cash.** If you follow the industry, you know that M&A is a real winner which will give them to expand even faster to additional markets.

I can't really think of many stocks that are better than Opendoor. Lots of potential here and it's at the price it jumped to on DA. It is more than 50%+ off of its highs and I think it represents a great buying opportunity as of right now.

So all the buying pressure will be coming from the hedge funds when they are forced to buy back shares that they borrowed. The problem is you're a hedgefund and you shorted more stocks than are available because you've always been able to do whatever you've wanted to with no consequences. But now the only shares available are owned by apes who are not selling which drives the price to the moon. That's the situation in a nutshell. 

Other short squeezes have occured with 20% short interest but GME is at least 140% but with the way the numbers are being fudged and hidden, I'm thinking it's actually 200-500%. Based on what comparable situations we have, there's no way this isn't touching 100's of thousands per share and I'm betting it goes into the millions. It's not about money anymore, it's about justice for the 2008 crash and other thievery. Apes are dead set on holding until every hedgefund involved in this circus is liquidated.

It's rather shocking to me that most people have never heard of ImmunityBio - IBRX in the biotech space.  They have this new drug called Anktiva could be a new cancer drug for a wide range of cancers. Not just one type but looks to be for mutliple types of cancers based on the study.  Seems like the side-effects are minimal.  Only downside I see from the study is that it's only a phase 2 trial of 140 patients so it's not as wide-ranging as a phase 3 study.  Although, Anktiva got a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in another phase 3 study.  So FDA approval could be on the horizon since a phase 3 was done for bladder cancer. 

But apparently according to the phase 2 study, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. . Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda).  Could be hope for those who have failed previous treatments for various solid tumors.   If you know of anyone that has cancer and has failed or is failing treatment(s), I would call up IBRX and try to get in a study.

I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I've consumed lately.
&nbsp;


##Let‚Äôs start with a look at overall market performance by sector

I like to use this to establish a point of reference - _what_ kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly?

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/cV2n4du)

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD](https://imgur.com/LrgETAx)

I‚Äôm using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that‚Äôs a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year‚Äôs growth trade has lagged and given back.

##Now let‚Äôs look at index performance:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/eaDWp9s)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/iGGKKee)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/57uD3Ue)

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.   
**Take-Aways**  

- Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce, seemingly fueled by panic-buying at the Thursday open.  
- The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces; for SPY the 50DMA has held, QQQ support at 316.  
- Despite the recent volatility, we have no had a significant drawdown; we're still close to ATHs on these indices, and specifically I look at QQQ's chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year.
- IWM appears to have formed a range, which I‚Äôd say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March. This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value (shown below) that started around this time. This chart is something to watch - if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run. 

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected ETFs 1y](https://imgur.com/kkdbTmk)

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

**Conjecture**  

- You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop: we‚Äôve held some established support and bounced nicely so hard to see us really breaking down further, alternatively we‚Äôve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between, which could be a sign of weakening  and indication of possible further downside.
- Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets. With the growing proliferation of the latter, we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on/with equities (or other) markets. If a bubble is bursting here, does it signal a growing risk-off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well? 


##Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year

I'm just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading; this is what I have in mind _right now_, but all of this can change in an instant of course: 

**Summer -** expecting the reflation trade (financials, energy, industrials, value) to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform.

**June FOMC -** There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here‚Ä¶ or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting.

**August Jackson Hole Meetup -** If we haven‚Äôt heard anything regarding tapering prior, speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change, as that‚Äôs what happened last year with inflation targeting. With fear of a taper tantrum, we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this.

**Late Summer -** If we haven‚Äôt had one by now, I‚Äôd expect a meaningful (10%) pullback. 

**Inflation Data -** June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes, but if we continue to get high prints into July, August, and later this year, inflation will become a real issue.

**Fall -** We start to get murky here. I‚Äôd look for a late-year rally to follow any pullback, but it‚Äôs hard to say; too many unknowns. 

**EOY Targets -** CNBC‚Äôs median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800. Consider we‚Äôre already +11%, +%12, +4% YTD on SPY, IWM, and QQQ respectively, and +86%, +119%, +92% since the March 2020 lows, is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near-term?

**Considerations**
- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Consider seasonality. We‚Äôre entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It‚Äôs something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- Have long exposure, but be careful with positioning and time horizons. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit, but there is no way you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&nbsp;

I think right now if you‚Äôre long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them. 

## Bonus Charts

**Commodities Performance**

I thought it would be interesting to look at the recent performance of certain commodities in comparison with major indices:

[Select Commodities vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/fRAUEyt)

[Select Commodities ETFs vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/jH48XtQ)

Lumber‚Äôs performance slightly skews the first chart, but in both we can see well enough that a divergence starting to occur in early-mid April - something to continue to watch as it‚Äôs a correlation with the inflation narrative but more specifically the supply chain issues we‚Äôve had. 

**Comparing Recent and (Recently) Historical Index Performance**

When considering the EOY Target data and the recent performance of equities, I thought it would be interesting to scale back a little further and do some historical comparisons:

[SPY 5y](https://imgur.com/NL0qgBn)

[QQQ 5y](https://imgur.com/aMIv0Xc)

[IWM 5y](https://imgur.com/LhEheTy)

From a low of 198.65 on 28 Jun 2016 to the pre-covid high of 338.12 on 10 Feb 2020, the SPY went up ~70%.  
We can look at the yearly breakdown:

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I‚Äôm big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I‚Äôve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I‚Äôve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE‚Äôs float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE‚Äôs 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled ‚ÄúHindenburg MVIS‚Äù and the second article that popped up was titled ‚ÄúTechnically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.‚Äù This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE‚Äôs pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg‚Äôs attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM‚Äôs investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that ‚ÄúTimeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.‚Äù

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

Based on what he‚Äôs seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre way way way far along,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.‚Äù

They also [recently announced ‚ÄúLordstown Week‚Äù](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.

* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you‚Äôd be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I‚Äôm planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20‚Äôs. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

[$UWMC 20 Day 2 Hour](https://preview.redd.it/titkhs0fmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=142a5763bf0da2864af7776d8e7cdb488607f00a)

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

5002,,2021-05-23 21:04:15,t3_njh8a7,,wallstreetbets,"Money¬†is used as a¬†medium of exchange, and as a¬†store of value.

In money supply statistics, central bank money is¬†MB¬†while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3¬†components. Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of¬†M1,¬†while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as¬†M2¬†and¬†M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of¬†currency in circulation¬†and¬†checking account¬†balances.
M2: M1 + most¬†savings accounts,¬†money market accounts, retail¬†money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit¬†of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other¬†CDs¬†(large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of¬†eurodollars¬†and¬†repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 +¬†Commercial Paper
M4: M4- +¬†T-Bills¬†(or M3 + Commercial Paper +¬†T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States¬†Federal Reserve¬†published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people‚Äôs saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People‚Äôs deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.
5004,,2021-05-23 22:13:52,t3_njipr1,,wallstreetbets,"Liquified natural gas, LNG, is one of the world's fastest growing fuel sources. Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth? This new product is quite impressive and going to be a key thing to keep an eye on because [they want to spin-off Kbank and the current estimated value is about $7 billion dollars](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html).

I believe Korean analysts are conservative, so to see headlines like this for a major company is interesting).

&#x200B;

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding. With a TTM net income of nearly 700 million dollars, a 50% dividend payout ratio and multiple high growth opportunities, why is it only valued at 7.4 billion dollars?

5013,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Advice: don't play this short term or you'll get bruned, markets can stay irrational for a long time. Just hold shares, maybe with 2:1 leverage if you are brave.

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.

5061,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

Revenue for the quarter came in at **$747.27 million versus** the **consensus estimate of $620.18** million which is **200% revenue growth from Q4 2020**

Q1 EPS of ($0.48), in-line with the analyst estimate of ($0.48

By end of the year, # of markets will be doubled from last year

For the second quarter of 2021, revenue is expected to be between **$1.025 billion and $1.075 billion,** which represents **41% sequential growth over 1Q21** at the midpoint of the expected range. Adjusted EBITDA1  is expected to be between ($5) million and $5 million, which represents breakeven margin at the midpoint of the expected range

AND, Opendoor has about $**2 billion in cash.** If you follow the industry, you know that M&A is a real winner which will give them to expand even faster to additional markets.

I can't really think of many stocks that are better than Opendoor. Lots of potential here and it's at the price it jumped to on DA. It is more than 50%+ off of its highs and I think it represents a great buying opportunity as of right now.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I've consumed lately.
&nbsp;


##Let‚Äôs start with a look at overall market performance by sector

I like to use this to establish a point of reference - _what_ kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly?

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/cV2n4du)

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD](https://imgur.com/LrgETAx)

I‚Äôm using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that‚Äôs a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year‚Äôs growth trade has lagged and given back.

##Now let‚Äôs look at index performance:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/eaDWp9s)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/iGGKKee)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/57uD3Ue)

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.   
**Take-Aways**  

- Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce, seemingly fueled by panic-buying at the Thursday open.  
- The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces; for SPY the 50DMA has held, QQQ support at 316.  
- Despite the recent volatility, we have no had a significant drawdown; we're still close to ATHs on these indices, and specifically I look at QQQ's chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year.
- IWM appears to have formed a range, which I‚Äôd say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March. This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value (shown below) that started around this time. This chart is something to watch - if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run. 

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected ETFs 1y](https://imgur.com/kkdbTmk)

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

**Conjecture**  

- You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop: we‚Äôve held some established support and bounced nicely so hard to see us really breaking down further, alternatively we‚Äôve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between, which could be a sign of weakening  and indication of possible further downside.
- Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets. With the growing proliferation of the latter, we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on/with equities (or other) markets. If a bubble is bursting here, does it signal a growing risk-off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well? 


##Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year

I'm just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading; this is what I have in mind _right now_, but all of this can change in an instant of course: 

**Summer -** expecting the reflation trade (financials, energy, industrials, value) to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform.

**June FOMC -** There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here‚Ä¶ or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting.

**August Jackson Hole Meetup -** If we haven‚Äôt heard anything regarding tapering prior, speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change, as that‚Äôs what happened last year with inflation targeting. With fear of a taper tantrum, we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this.

**Late Summer -** If we haven‚Äôt had one by now, I‚Äôd expect a meaningful (10%) pullback. 

**Inflation Data -** June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes, but if we continue to get high prints into July, August, and later this year, inflation will become a real issue.

**Fall -** We start to get murky here. I‚Äôd look for a late-year rally to follow any pullback, but it‚Äôs hard to say; too many unknowns. 

**EOY Targets -** CNBC‚Äôs median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800. Consider we‚Äôre already +11%, +%12, +4% YTD on SPY, IWM, and QQQ respectively, and +86%, +119%, +92% since the March 2020 lows, is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near-term?

**Considerations**
- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Consider seasonality. We‚Äôre entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It‚Äôs something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- Have long exposure, but be careful with positioning and time horizons. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit, but there is no way you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&nbsp;

I think right now if you‚Äôre long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them.

**Commodities Performance**

I thought it would be interesting to look at the recent performance of certain commodities in comparison with major indices:

Lumber‚Äôs performance slightly skews the first chart, but in both we can see well enough that a divergence starting to occur in early-mid April - something to continue to watch as it‚Äôs a correlation with the inflation narrative but more specifically the supply chain issues we‚Äôve had. 

**Comparing Recent and (Recently) Historical Index Performance**

When considering the EOY Target data and the recent performance of equities, I thought it would be interesting to scale back a little further and do some historical comparisons:

From a low of 198.65 on 28 Jun 2016 to the pre-covid high of 338.12 on 10 Feb 2020, the SPY went up ~70%.  
We can look at the yearly breakdown:

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I‚Äôm big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I‚Äôve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I‚Äôve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE‚Äôs float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE‚Äôs 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled ‚ÄúHindenburg MVIS‚Äù and the second article that popped up was titled ‚ÄúTechnically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.‚Äù This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE‚Äôs pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg‚Äôs attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM‚Äôs investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that ‚ÄúTimeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.‚Äù

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio‚Äôs Endorsement of LMC:** üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn‚Äôt mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it ‚Äú‚Äòbull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don‚Äôt get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.‚Äù

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): ‚ÄúI think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area ‚Äî Voltage Valley as we like to call it ‚Äî but all over Ohio.‚Äù

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) ‚ÄúReally, this is the future,‚Äù DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. ‚ÄúI think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.‚Äù

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he‚Äôs visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he‚Äôs seen the company‚Äôs robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he‚Äôs seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre way way way far along,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.‚Äù

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE‚ÄôS**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced ‚ÄúLordstown Week‚Äù](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.
* [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now).
* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you‚Äôd be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I‚Äôm planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20‚Äôs. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

[$UWMC 20 Day 2 Hour](https://preview.redd.it/titkhs0fmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=142a5763bf0da2864af7776d8e7cdb488607f00a)

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

5249,,2021-05-23 21:04:15,t3_njh8a7,,wallstreetbets,"Money¬†is used as a¬†medium of exchange, and as a¬†store of value.

In money supply statistics, central bank money is¬†MB¬†while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3¬†components. Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of¬†M1,¬†while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as¬†M2¬†and¬†M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of¬†currency in circulation¬†and¬†checking account¬†balances.
M2: M1 + most¬†savings accounts,¬†money market accounts, retail¬†money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit¬†of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other¬†CDs¬†(large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of¬†eurodollars¬†and¬†repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 +¬†Commercial Paper
M4: M4- +¬†T-Bills¬†(or M3 + Commercial Paper +¬†T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States¬†Federal Reserve¬†published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people‚Äôs saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People‚Äôs deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares.

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth?

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding.

5260,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Don't think I need to say anything here. It's pretty obvious that there could be a very sharp rebound from the trendline soon enough

Advice: don't play this short term or you'll get bruned, markets can stay irrational for a long time. Just hold shares, maybe with 2:1 leverage if you are brave.

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

5308,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

Q1 EPS of ($0.48), in-line with the analyst estimate of ($0.48

By end of the year, # of markets will be doubled from last year

For the second quarter of 2021, revenue is expected to be between **$1.025 billion and $1.075 billion,** which represents **41% sequential growth over 1Q21** at the midpoint of the expected range. Adjusted EBITDA1  is expected to be between ($5) million and $5 million, which represents breakeven margin at the midpoint of the expected range

AND, Opendoor has about $**2 billion in cash.** If you follow the industry, you know that M&A is a real winner which will give them to expand even faster to additional markets.

I can't really think of many stocks that are better than Opendoor. Lots of potential here and it's at the price it jumped to on DA. It is more than 50%+ off of its highs and I think it represents a great buying opportunity as of right now.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

Nearly 14 million shares of the Las Cruces, New Mexico-based company were sold short over the past 30 days, meaning the stock‚Äôs Monday surge after a test flight has dealt short-sellers millions of dollars in losses, data compiled by financial analytics company S3 Partners show. With short interest sitting at $949 million, more than a fifth of shares available for trading are sold short and that could prompt bears to cover their bets, S3 Partners said.

That increase in short selling has already resulted in mark-to-market losses of $427 million for bears this year -- with $366 million of those losses occurring over the last eight days, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, wrote in a report Monday. With short bets against the company getting more crowded and as losses increase, the company appears to be ripe for a short squeeze, he wrote.

A short squeeze occurs when a stock posts a large gain, forcing short sellers to cover their positions by buying shares, which in turn pushes the stock even higher.

Virgin Galactic soared as much as 21% in Monday‚Äôs trading to the highest level since April 14 after the company conducted its first test flight to space in more than two years. Michael Ciarmoli, an analyst at Truist Securities, called the event a ‚Äúmajor milestone.‚Äù

With Virgin Galactic ‚Äústock price rallying, we should at minimum expect this surge in short selling come to an abrupt stop and more likely be replaced with short covering,‚Äù Dusaniwsky wrote. He also estimated that with losses piling up, it‚Äôs become increasingly likely that newer shorts may capitulate and trim their positions.",,

Let‚Äôs use SOS, which just announced today that it has entered the framework agreement with Leibodong Hydropower Station (""Leibodong"") in Hejiang, Luzhou, Sichuan Province, where hydropower resources are much richer and electricity prices much lower than the rest part of China. Pursuant to the agreement, Leibodong will supply SOS with electricity to its cloud crypto mining and big data center.

Leibodong is located in Dazuoba village, Fubao Town, Hejiang County, Luzhou, Sichuan Province. It is a level three cascade hydropower station of Dacao River Basin of Tang River, the first-level tributary of the upper Yangtze River. The normal water level of Leibodong is 560m, with the function of daily adjustments. Its adjustment capacity is 1.57 million m3.

I don't act on everything they recommend or suggest.  I just don't trade enough for that, but at the cost (couple hundred bucks), if I may 3-5 decisions a year on it, it is VERY well worth it to me.  

Overall, I look at what they recommend (if I have money to drop in, I usually have a min amount of $5k that I want to put on any rec) and then see if it makes sense to me.  Some of the businesses don't, or there will be like a dozen app companies recommended and I only want 1-2, etc.  

If I have smaller amounts to drop in, I'll usually re-up on something I already own.  I do follow the sell advice.

If I were spending your $1k/mo, I'd invest $2k every 2 months, checking existing recommendations to see what may be depressed that you think will come back.  If I didn't find anything super inspiring, I'd just drop it on one of the 'core' stock recommendations.  I think I have like 7-8 of their recommended 'starter stocks' (from over the years).",,

They are; just to a lesser amount of that person's total wealth.  When someone cannot build up M1/M2 to dump into M3+/investment they stagnate fiscally.. this doesn't mean they cannot rise out of it.. but when he says ""people live on M1/m2"" it's accurate for the overwhelming majority that live paycheck to paycheck.  You have to have money going to the small business owner through M2 in order for them to put food on the table and pay for things and move inventory through the system to the consumer....   Literally every boomer on your block is likely trying to stack into M3/investment as they rely upon pension/SS/investments which outpace the F of their expenses....  The ""eat the rich"" motto isn't coming from these boomers!  They are not spending that excess $ they are receiving and instead just stacking higher into M3/investments because they don't need it to live off of.  

It's extra for them to pass onto their kids.

honestly I'm not so sure you're an economist... if you are.. you're damn well out of touch with the average person's spending behavior and is likely the real root of the problem is the majority of economists hold your same ideals.",,

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I‚Äôm big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I‚Äôve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I‚Äôve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE‚Äôs float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE‚Äôs 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled ‚ÄúHindenburg MVIS‚Äù and the second article that popped up was titled ‚ÄúTechnically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.‚Äù This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE‚Äôs pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg‚Äôs attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM‚Äôs investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that ‚ÄúTimeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.‚Äù

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio‚Äôs Endorsement of LMC:** üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn‚Äôt mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it ‚Äú‚Äòbull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don‚Äôt get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.‚Äù

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): ‚ÄúI think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area ‚Äî Voltage Valley as we like to call it ‚Äî but all over Ohio.‚Äù

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) ‚ÄúReally, this is the future,‚Äù DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. ‚ÄúI think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.‚Äù

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he‚Äôs visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he‚Äôs seen the company‚Äôs robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he‚Äôs seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre way way way far along,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.‚Äù

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE‚ÄôS**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced ‚ÄúLordstown Week‚Äù](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.
* [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now).
* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you‚Äôd be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I‚Äôm planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20‚Äôs. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

[$UWMC 20 Day 2 Hour](https://preview.redd.it/titkhs0fmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=142a5763bf0da2864af7776d8e7cdb488607f00a)

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

6083,,2021-05-23 21:04:15,t3_njh8a7,,wallstreetbets,"Money¬†is used as a¬†medium of exchange, and as a¬†store of value.

In money supply statistics, central bank money is¬†MB¬†while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3¬†components. Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of¬†M1,¬†while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as¬†M2¬†and¬†M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of¬†currency in circulation¬†and¬†checking account¬†balances.
M2: M1 + most¬†savings accounts,¬†money market accounts, retail¬†money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit¬†of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other¬†CDs¬†(large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of¬†eurodollars¬†and¬†repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 +¬†Commercial Paper
M4: M4- +¬†T-Bills¬†(or M3 + Commercial Paper +¬†T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States¬†Federal Reserve¬†published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people‚Äôs saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People‚Äôs deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",njh97r,ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings.
6085,,2021-05-23 22:13:52,t3_njipr1,,wallstreetbets,"Liquified natural gas, LNG, is one of the world's fastest growing fuel sources. Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares. There has been several secondaries over the past 18 month and the price action has generally been a significant pullback then an aggressive rebound. We are at the bottom of the pullback right now.  See chart link below from the mattress king indicating previous secondaries and subsequent recoveries.

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth?

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding.

6094,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

6106,,2021-05-24 13:22:58,t3_njxv95,,wallstreetbets,"**Preamble:** The current jump in US consumer prices has understandably spooked investors. The current CPI numbers stand at 4.2 percent which is the highest they have been since Sep 2008 (the increase was almost 4x of what was expected). 

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Don't think I need to say anything here. It's pretty obvious that there could be a very sharp rebound from the trendline soon enough

Advice: don't play this short term or you'll get bruned, markets can stay irrational for a long time. Just hold shares, maybe with 2:1 leverage if you are brave.

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",nk4z03,I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures

6142,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

6155,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and silver for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

Obviously we can't let important things fail, like power grids, and in turn power companies. By the nature of how important something is to us, we can't treat it equally and let some things fail?

Always some weird line of what people consider the greater good. Ideals vs suffering? idk. Something to think about I guess?.

At that point they'll start talking about how the apocalypse is upon us. When this first happens, buy the dip and ride the bounce. Once the normie news declares crisis averted, sell everything, watch the carnage unfold in the markets, and prepare you home for zombie attacks.

The stock market is a leading indicator of the real economy, so 6 months after the big crash you can expect to lose your job at wendies. When this happens go full retard, I know you never go full retard, but when you're looking at fully retarded valuations your own retardedness will be perfectly cancelled out. This day only comes around once every 7 years give or take and is usually accompanied by a small breakout to the downside in gold.

You'll be treated like the biggest idiot at first, but when the market is up 300% they'll all just try to change the subject whenever you bring it up. So you need to keep rubbing it in.

I called out the clear bubble of the Dow Jones Index last month, and all people could say was ""uSe A lOg grapH"" or ""Compare it to gold"". Well I did one better, I compared it to GME. People have always called GME the ""new gold"", and I think it's only fair to view it in the same light. The findings are scary. As you can see above, the ratio follows very close to that of inflation. It then slows late 2019. This can probably be blamed on the Fed saying they were wrong, according to the Guardian. From here, it only gets worse. Covid dropped numbers significantly (No surprise), but the ratio is yet to recover.

It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares. There has been several secondaries over the past 18 month and the price action has generally been a significant pullback then an aggressive rebound. We are at the bottom of the pullback right now.  See chart link below from the mattress king indicating previous secondaries and subsequent recoveries.

Also the 10 analysts covering PRPL have it as a strong buy and an avg price target of 38 with a high of 45.

PRPL also is very nearly oversold and is below rsi 50 (neutral)  so there is good runway to the upside from where we are now.  Article discussion linked below

17,000 shares
6/18 35c
7/16 30, 35,40c
Jan 2023 leaps ITM at 20c and also 40c.
10/15 30c
Also also have several CSPs of varying strikes

They also significantly beat on their recent earnings report and raised guidance for the year.

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PRPL/earnings/


I believe that with the back drop of a very positive earnings report, raised guidance, and a non dilutive secondary offering that there is significant catalyst to propel PRPL back to the mid to high 30's and potentially all time high of low 40s. I expect a steep climb over the next few weeks.

For further excellent DD please see our beloved Mattress King u/Dhsmatt2

Tldr: I'm jacked past my tits on prpl, at 29 now gonna be high 30s very soon due to catalysts listed above. 

My recs would be 
July 30s and 35s very good chance of printing

June 30s and 35s if you want more horse power. 

ITM leaps 20s (spreads are wide so be careful) if you want some relatively safe leverage

Shares for boomer fucks,

Just a regular investor trying to figure out the value of KT Corporation. I am currently long via shares and July 2021 12.50 and 15.00 call options.

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth? This new product is quite impressive and going to be a key thing to keep an eye on because [they want to spin-off Kbank and the current estimated value is about $7 billion dollars](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html).

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding.

7284,,2021-05-24 05:07:07,t3_njq4z0,,wallstreetbets,"Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

So who knows maybe you have a real share or maybe you have the fake one.

What this means is that if you have a broker who buys your shares and you pay them for the said shares your name isn't on those shares the brokers name is on those shares.

7296,,2021-05-24 13:22:58,t3_njxv95,,wallstreetbets,"**Preamble:** The current jump in US consumer prices has understandably spooked investors. The current CPI numbers stand at 4.2 percent which is the highest they have been since Sep 2008 (the increase was almost 4x of what was expected). 

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.

7331,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream.

Revenue for the quarter came in at **$747.27 million versus** the **consensus estimate of $620.18** million which is **200% revenue growth from Q4 2020**

Q1 EPS of ($0.48), in-line with the analyst estimate of ($0.48

By end of the year, # of markets will be doubled from last year

For the second quarter of 2021, revenue is expected to be between **$1.025 billion and $1.075 billion,** which represents **41% sequential growth over 1Q21** at the midpoint of the expected range. Adjusted EBITDA1  is expected to be between ($5) million and $5 million, which represents breakeven margin at the midpoint of the expected range

AND, Opendoor has about $**2 billion in cash.** If you follow the industry, you know that M&A is a real winner which will give them to expand even faster to additional markets.

I can't really think of many stocks that are better than Opendoor. Lots of potential here and it's at the price it jumped to on DA. It is more than 50%+ off of its highs and I think it represents a great buying opportunity as of right now.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

7341,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and silver for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I‚Äôve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

7543,,2021-05-24 02:23:56,t3_njndfx,,wallstreetbets,"Tards, our favorite mattress stock is currently positioned for significant upside. It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares. There has been several secondaries over the past 18 month and the price action has generally been a significant pullback then an aggressive rebound. We are at the bottom of the pullback right now.  See chart link below from the mattress king indicating previous secondaries and subsequent recoveries.

Also the 10 analysts covering PRPL have it as a strong buy and an avg price target of 38 with a high of 45.

PRPL also is very nearly oversold and is below rsi 50 (neutral)  so there is good runway to the upside from where we are now.  Article discussion linked below

They also significantly beat on their recent earnings report and raised guidance for the year.

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PRPL/earnings/


I believe that with the back drop of a very positive earnings report, raised guidance, and a non dilutive secondary offering that there is significant catalyst to propel PRPL back to the mid to high 30's and potentially all time high of low 40s. I expect a steep climb over the next few weeks.

June 30s and 35s if you want more horse power.

Just a regular investor trying to figure out the value of KT Corporation. I am currently long via shares and July 2021 12.50 and 15.00 call options.

**History of my Due Diligence:**

&#x200B;

[First Post on 1/31/2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepDueDiligence/comments/l9692t/kt_kt_corporation_top_korean_telecom_below_book/)

[Second Post on 3/15/2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepDueDiligence/comments/m5y5yc/six_week_update_on_kt_corporation_stock_up_11/)

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ‚Äô21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth? This new product is quite impressive and going to be a key thing to keep an eye on because [they want to spin-off Kbank and the current estimated value is about $7 billion dollars](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html).

5/18/2021 - [KT Corp opens data center in Seoul, in response to increased demand](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/kt-corp-opens-data-center-in-seoul-south-korea/) (this reiterates the growth targets mentioned in the 3/17/2021 article).

5/21/2021 - [Korean Analysts predicting stock will double by 2022](https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202105210009) (Analysts seem to be digesting all the news and recent earnings postively... which is good to see. I believe Korean analysts are conservative, so to see headlines like this for a major company is interesting).

Ongoing .... [A huge amount of patents being filed this year and last](https://www.quiverquant.com/patentsearch/ticker/KT?searchticker=KT). I haven't done too much research into their patent portfolio, but a couple new ones popped up this week which led me to the linked website. They seem to be protecting their 5G innovations a bunch...

&#x200B;

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding. With a TTM net income of nearly 700 million dollars, a 50% dividend payout ratio and multiple high growth opportunities, why is it only valued at 7.4 billion dollars?

I don‚Äôt say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I‚Äôm aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren‚Äôt technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we‚Äôll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you‚Äôre a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL‚Äôs market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don‚Äôt see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It‚Äôs the only stock here I don‚Äôt think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta‚Äôs 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline‚Äôs besides Southwest, but Delta‚Äôs yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up‚Äôs (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL‚Äôs). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn‚Äôt an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL‚Äôs has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôd love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn‚Äôt legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",njq4z0,Airline sector DD

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

7595,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and silver for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc)

7608,,2021-05-24 19:50:44,t3_nk6md0,,wallstreetbets,"The point is that senior employees of public companies are required to make their transactions public. It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I‚Äôve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

**So, top 5 companies by insider buying activity:**

I will post the second list with the top 5 companies by insider selling activity later in a separate post, if you like this topic.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I don't know if this next line is necessary or not but just to be safe....I'm not a professional financial advisor and this is not investment advice.",nk79sh,$CHWY - Earnings coming up - huge upside potential

# FAQ
 
## What does this mean?
 
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
 
## Why did you do this?
 
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
 
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
 
## Am I banned from the Reddit?
 
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
 
## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
 
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
 
## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
 
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",,

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.

We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.

Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

8532,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

Revenue for the quarter came in at **$747.27 million versus** the **consensus estimate of $620.18** million which is **200% revenue growth from Q4 2020**

Q1 EPS of ($0.48), in-line with the analyst estimate of ($0.48

By end of the year, # of markets will be doubled from last year

For the second quarter of 2021, revenue is expected to be between **$1.025 billion and $1.075 billion,** which represents **41% sequential growth over 1Q21** at the midpoint of the expected range. Adjusted EBITDA1  is expected to be between ($5) million and $5 million, which represents breakeven margin at the midpoint of the expected range

AND, Opendoor has about $**2 billion in cash.** If you follow the industry, you know that M&A is a real winner which will give them to expand even faster to additional markets.

I can't really think of many stocks that are better than Opendoor. Lots of potential here and it's at the price it jumped to on DA. It is more than 50%+ off of its highs and I think it represents a great buying opportunity as of right now.

What are your thoughts on the quarter and what do you think its price target is for the coming year and long term?

Lordstown Motors options imply 22.5% move in share price post-earnings (TheFlyOnTheWall)

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

8542,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I‚Äôve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

9003,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

Pre-earnings options volume in Lordstown Motors ( [RIDE](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=RIDE) ) is 1.1x normal with calls leading puts 7:4. Implied volatility suggests the market is anticipating a move near 22.5%, or $2.18, after results are released. Median move over the past eight quarters is 13.8%.",nk6496,$RIDE - Options Imply A Move Is Coming

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

9013,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I‚Äôve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

This is not just some random speculative boring pre revenue biomed stock that may or may not work. It's the fucking future and VG is one of the first to create and enter a new industry. And I will support them as best I can with the money I have. Not only because I am extremely bullish on it, but also because I, among many undecided others, am a space nerd who can only dream to go to space. For now.

Let's conquer this final frontier ladies and gentlemen.",,

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Don't think I need to say anything here. It's pretty obvious that there could be a very sharp rebound from the trendline soon enough

Advice: don't play this short term or you'll get bruned, markets can stay irrational for a long time. Just hold shares, maybe with 2:1 leverage if you are brave.

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.

9451,,2021-05-24 18:49:18,t3_nk56mr,,wallstreetbets,"So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*.

No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

9461,,2021-05-24 19:42:47,t3_nk6fnw,,wallstreetbets,"Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ .",nk6fnw,$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play

I just got in today, though I have been wanting to get in for the last week (had to clear some other positions) and looks like I lost about 10% potential gains (I shouldnt have even thought about my other shitty positions!). I am looking at at least 20% more gains over the next 3 months

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I don't know if this next line is necessary or not but just to be safe....I'm not a professional financial advisor and this is not investment advice.",nk79sh,$CHWY - Earnings coming up - huge upside potential

Last week I sold calls for the first time and I decided to go all in. I had about $2,780 invested in QYLD which gave me about $343 a year and $28.6 a month. I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term.

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

Don't think I need to say anything here. It's pretty obvious that there could be a very sharp rebound from the trendline soon enough

Advice: don't play this short term or you'll get bruned, markets can stay irrational for a long time. Just hold shares, maybe with 2:1 leverage if you are brave.

Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.
