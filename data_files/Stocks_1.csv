Seem familiar?

Bread is one of the worst things in the world, but we’ve always needed it. Until now!

By burning three diff types of meat together, the Tracy Jordan Meat machine takes bread out of the equation!

Now your sandwich is all of the good stuff! That’s delicious. 

Doctor: “And its healthy. Hi, I’m Dr. Leo Spaceman. I’m a working physician with a degree from the Ho Chi Min school of medicine.”

Dr. Spaceman, is it true that bread eats away at your brain?”

Doctor: “We have no way of knowing because the powerful bread lobby keeps stopping my research!”

Well folks, bread will never maybe attack your brain again. Because with the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine, say it with me now:

&#x200B;

**MEAT IS THE NEW BREAD!**

\[Look up 30 Rock- Tracy Jordan Meat Machine if want to watch this, much better than words can describe\]

&#x200B;

**FEYE**\- FireEye, I have some of this as the company is highly regarded by cyber security professionals. Often where they go when they need help! Saw them in the headlines this week due to the Colonial Pipeline ransomware. 

&#x200B;

Speaking of Colonial, they just paid the ransomware ransom of 5 million dollars to the group DarkSide who now apparently plans to disband and apologized for all the gasoline worries! How kind.

&#x200B;

**BMW** seems to be decent luxury car maker pure play. 46% owned by two brothers so no risk of takeover, rejecting all the bells and whistles of advertising in favor of simply making a good product and selling it. China sales doubled \[while TSLA sales down in China\]. p/e under 20 for the German ticker. Need to look at the ADR to see how many German shares it represents 

&#x200B;

**Rblx**\- loss of 0.46 per share \[0.25 miss\]; revenue was up 147% YoY\[miss\] and bookings were higher. Daily active users also increased 79% YoY up to 42.1 million. Rblx appears up on the earnings and calls outnumbering puts roughly 3:1 with May 14th 70 call being most actively traded contract as of Tuesday \[source schwab options report\]- I have a handful of shares as tons and tons of daily users.

&#x200B;

Out of China, seeing **speculation** that China’s Crypto is going to be **gold** backed which should be interesting in terms of gold supply and demand. I have a couple shares of some random gold miner and maybe a gold etf I dont know. But yeah. Very interesting and potentially paradigm shift. I could not confirm that it would be gold backed through any article that appeared completely neutral. They would likely try to divest their holdings of US Debt/US Currency prior to formally announcing this as it would cause shocks across the FOREX markets I would think and devalue USD and possibly others.

 Market week ran an article on how much Gold China owns, very interesting read. I am and have been bullish on China, I own baba, tencent and many other Chinese tech companies. I think absent some world war or full blow Cold War that China will be the next global super power for good or ill so take that as you will. I also am long the yuan for this reason despite not necessarily supporting China in a social/moral sense.\[lets go back to only doing camps for fun instead of for whole portions of populations for no other reason then ethnic/religious backgrounds!\]

I am still long on the stay at home thesis, yes there is pent up demand to go out and shop/eat/travel, but after this experience I think people may invest more into their home just so they are not caught off guard if this were to happen again in the future. Combine that with the increased work from home workforce and I think the stay at home stocks will be just fine in the long run.  The sell off in tech is an entry point if you don’t believe that the whole system will ultimately collapse and you have the ability to wait out the downturn.  The only way to time the absolute bottom is blind luck so just buy companies you like at valuations that don’t offend you and I believe you will be fine over the long term.

&#x200B;

We are now showing **Fear** on CNN fear and greed index.  A year ago it was more fearful, but some great returns were built in those times, so perhaps the recent pullbacks over inflation concerns are overblown.  If you believe in the continued recovery of the world economy then I think definitely time to start being a little bit greedy.  As Buffett and others have said- be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.

&#x200B;

Times like these are where the greatest returns can be born.

&#x200B;

**VMW**\- new CEO techno centric- VMWare. Been with company since 2003 when was still a startup and now 12 billion business. He’s been leading push into selling software that lets companies run their internal and external apps in multiple cloud computing services and in house data centers. NO requirement for employees to return to physical offices full time which seems like Ag old move as some other companies that said would promote people who came back into office over those WFH faced a walkout. The need for options is essential in keeping high value employees without making them feel ostracized for making decisions that are best for themselves and there family. Currently trading in the 156 range yahoo consensus is  170.79; 32 p/e. 4.86 EPS.  Earnings report 5/27/2021, I may try and pick up a couple shares before earnings or see what other options are for long term investment this seems like one to me.

Sanctuary, an astrology startup that also sells psychic readings to users for no low price. U.S. laws around psychic readings are patchwork at best, with CEO and founder Ross Clark arguing the app is offering entertainment rather than fortune-telling—exempting it from the more onerous of state laws. The readings, Clark says, is a practice in empathy rather than actually peering into the crystal ball. But still, the question remains, is funding the practice ethical? 

Some investors think otherwise. Lux Capital’s Josh Wolfe on Twitter did not mince his words upon hearing news of the startup’s seed funding: “Seriously shame on anyone funding or encouraging this bullsh\*t. No doubt there is demand, but this isn’t peddling entertainment, it’s encouraging slippery slope snake oil flapdoodle.” Here too is Vinod Khosla at Khosla Ventures in response to Wolfe’s tweet: “Agree. There is also demand for heroin, fat, sugar… I’d be ashamed to fund such a venture.” 

Proponents argue that astrology and psychic readings play a similar role as religion or therapy, while its detractors argue the practice is rooted in pseudoscience. 

 

Disrupters on the dip, possible entry points if like the companies:

&#x200B;

**TSLA**\- recently big dip.  They do have decent advantage in EV market having good tech but there is tons and tons of money being burned by competitors to catch up and overtake. Currently \~36% down from its 52 week highs.

&#x200B;

**ETSY**\- 37% off its 52 week highs. Still vulnerable because growth stock and these will be the first sacrificed in any major downturn. But it is rapidly growing and it is the only one focused solely on creative goods made by artists/entrepreneurs. Gross merchandise sales \[3.1 billion\] 132.3% YOY increase in Q1, net income \[143.8 billion\] up 1048.1% YOY. Yahoo price target consensus at 226.13. Did turn a profit. 3.52 EPS, 46.32 P/E. 20.73 Billion market cap. I own some and have been happy. Seems like they use debt sparingly and have a good cash flow. So probably would sell off in major downturn but doubt would be in danger of bankruptcy or not being able to weather a storm.

&#x200B;

**LOVE**\-Lovesac- American furniture retailer. I’m not sold here but they do modular furniture and apparently doing pretty well. 4 years of double digit net sales growth, expanded digital channels during pandemic, makes products from recycled plastic bottles and furniture built to last lifetime so that is appealing. Yahoo price target consensus for one year at 74.50 which is lower then the \~75 its at now. EPS .96, P/E 79.07. Would think about it if pulled back but not at current price myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some REITS to consider: 

&#x200B;

**FRT**\- Federal Realty Investment trust, focusing on shopping centers, street retail, mixed use. Major markets in LA, DC< NY, Silicon Valley. Many tenants like grocery stores, restaurants, fitness centers, service based business. 3.8% dividend.  I would be worried about the markets they are in as there is a recent exodus from cities like this in favor of the new tech centers such as Austin and Miami. 

&#x200B;

**IIPR**\- Innovative Industrial Properties- this one has been on my radar for a year +, I got in fairly early and sold last march to reap the profits as thought downturn was going to be longer lasting.  I am back in a couple shares and happy. It specializes in medical cannabis growers. So they just set up the warehouses and have triple net leases IIRC so they have virtually no ongoing costs and just reap rent profits. Cannabis use seems to be up big in the pandemic so may be a lasting trend and with it becoming legal in more and more states I think this is a long term smart play.  3.16% dividend on the normal shares and does sell preferred shares with larger dividend as well. Only have one share in the normal, down 3.76% on stock price I bought at and \~4 shares in the IIPR/PRA 9% preferred dividend I am up \~14%. No plans to sell either.

&#x200B;

**STAG**\- stag industrial, inc. invests in warehouses across country, \~40% of portfolio is leased to e-commerce tenants. Biggest tenant is AMZN, but AMZN constantly looking to cut out middle men and achieve vertical monopolies in every field they operate it seems.  The good thing for STAG is that IIRC, this came up on my radar a while back and many of their properties are located in key areas around international airports and there is only so much warehouse space available that is located in key spots like this, so while AMZN can very well replace them in areas that have space, this may not be possible for reasonable costs in metropolitan areas, especially around airport hubs. I do have a couple shares in here and am up \~20% with no plans of selling at this time.

&#x200B;

Will be interesting to see how we do as Mask Mandates are ending across the country as we approach the 4th of July and summer traveling season.  Will enough of America be vaccinated/have natural immunity due to infection to prevent another spike? Will the world get it together before we create and spread a variant that does not respond to vaccines? Time will tell, and possibly present some fire sales if the panic and fear sets in again a la March 2020.

&#x200B;

**CriCut**\- MarketBeat presented this as a very interesting company but my subsequent \[quick research\] did not back that up. Allegedly company that helps people design and build any idea they might have. Growth at triple digit rate. Not profitable. Added 600k new users last quarter. Paid subscriptions up 140% to 1.6 million paid subscriptions. Yahoo price consensus around 27 with 5 analysts weighing in from a low of 23 to a high of 35. Currently \~24-25. Something I will look into...searching online just brings up a bunch of fancy label makers though a nod on website not seeing this design and build any idea so not sure what this article is talking about. If anyone sees something I missed let me know because from article looked very interesting. Not so much after looking at website and reading the wiki.

The article states that T shareholders will maintain a large stake in the new entity. It’s unclear (at least to me) whether these media assets will be a new company altogether or be a part of Discovery.

Perhaps this suggests some of these media assets will push into cord-cutting and streaming, further suggesting the end of linear TV.

The deal is likely an attempt for HBO Max and Discovery + to form a giant conglomeration that can take on Disney + and Netflix. AT&T owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, and Warner Bros. Studios. Discovery owns Food Network, HGTV, TLC, and Animal Planet.

There are however, a lot of parts of investing that I really don’t understand. I google stuff constantly and try and do my own research but it can get pretty confusing. 
My current question is about margin buying. I was recently offered the ability to use margin buying on RH and was given an $11,000 margin which seems dangerous to me because from what I have gleaned from my research, buying on margin is like using credit from whatever platform you’re using to invest. 
Let’s say I use $500 on the margin to buy stock, when I deposit more money will they automatically take that $500 back? Is that how you pay it off? Are they making money off of this? Like hidden fees and exorbitant interest rates and stuff like that?I guess what I mean is, overall, is it sketchy? Should I avoid buying on a margin? 
One reason I’ve seen given as a benefit is that you’re able to buy more stock at the time when you need to and therefore can make more profit because it gives you additional capital to invest.

As weeks and months went by, stocks in those industries kept increasing - airlines, cruises, casinos, et al. Come February, I wanted to find more recovery plays and landed on one of my better trades of the last few months - call options on Live Nation ($LYV). In the last few weeks I wanted to do more digging as I questioned that maybe there's something left as a recovery play. I ran across $SPG, Simon Properties Group.

I believe SPG is a great pick as it has big upside potential for a large cap stock (40bn market cap), with minimal downside risk. Being mostly an investor/owner of malls (the largest in the nation), and mall-like real estate, the stock was obviously shot down at the start of the pandemic last year. It has recovered since but not to pre-Covid levels and far from all time highs of $229 (currently at $122).  


The stock offers a nice dividend to top it all off, the only time it diluted is when it made some acquisitions for basically pennies on the dollar at the height of the pandemic (great moves), and run by good management.   They’ve even kept paying the dividend, paying it out every quarter still, with Q1 2020 being the sole exception, when everything was closed.

I am not a financial advisor and I am not good at writing DD’s with fancy colors and graphs. Please do your own research before investing

About 2 months ago we saw the fallout of Archegos, and Bill Hwang become a laughing stock after losing 20 billion dollars from his margin call. Viacom ($VIAC) and Discovery ($DISCA) were among the hardest hit in that selloff. Let’s cut to the chase on why this is this is ready for takeoff, and that big buyers are gonna swoop this back up to new highs 

For starters, the stock currently has a moderately high short interest ratio of 25%. It’s amongst the top shorted stocks within the NYSE. 

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/DISCA/short-interest/

On top of the moderately high short interest, you might notice $DISCA is the class A version of the stock. There are actually two other tickers discovery sells shares for: $DISCB and $DISCK. What’s very interesting is despite $DISCK and $DISCA shares trading relatively similar prices, $DISCB shares have actually soared since the selloff, and are trading at double the amount of the regular class A shares. What’s the difference between class A and class B shares? Simple.

“The difference between Class A shares and Class B shares of a company’s stock usually comes down to the number of voting rights assigned to the shareholder.  Class A shareholders generally have more clout”


https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062215/what-difference-between-class-shares-and-other-common-shares-companys-stock.asp

Now, why is this due for a squeeze? Today, news came out about AT&T wanting to combine media assets with discovery, pushing the valuation of the company to a whopping 150 Billion dollars. Currently, Discovery’s market cap sits at a valuation of 17.41 billion dollars, meaning this merger would push its valuation up 8.6x. I dont know about you guys but that sounds pretty wild to me.

The company revisions in their earnings call slide presentation on May 6th project Adjusted EPS of $9.12-10.14 in 2021. Comparable companies trade around 10x, and TSE closed Friday at $67.75. 

There is MORE! TSE is 94.77% institutionally owned and 2.2% by insiders leaving a public float of basically 3% with total shares outstanding of 38.74m as of 5/3/21. That leaves about 1.16m shares float. TSE trades an average 10 day volume of 375.79k, yes that is a K for 375,790 shares traded on average. Meaning to be that once volume by retail catches on the stock could bounce quickly. 

This is not stock advice, but what it appears to me is that once the analysts get off their bums and do the math the revisions will be HUGE! 

Lastly, the technicals on the chart finally straightened out to where the 20,50,100 and 200 day moving averages are back in order and hence, “BEGINNING OF A BREAKOUT.”

37,2021-05-17 12:14:09,t3_neemc8,neemc8,stocks,"Been doing some DD on TWLO and can't wrap my head around what to me seems like one of the key risks/bear scenarios, being the eventual decline/obsolescence of SMS. 

I believe in the bull thesis and think Jeff Lawson has an amazing vision for the business and potential to grow the business into a developer-led customer engagement business, but today, the core business is still being a communications API provider. 

TWLO generates 45% of its revenue currently from SMS, providing the API which is used by businesses to prove an array of services, marketing, notifications, updates and codes to name a few examples. 

Unlike voice or email which does not appear likely to be replaced, when you look at SMS, it's hard to see a world where SMS thrives over the various chat apps, given the limited functionality of SMS over the internet-based apps. The only advantage SMS has over an internet app is it its ubiquity and platform/device agnostic nature, which affords it a high degree of visibility and front-page status on most people's phone real estate. Part of this, I would argue, is also because old habits die hard and we all expect SMS when interacting with those outside of our social networks.

However, if the West goes the way of what is being seen in China, with the almost universal adoption of a singular chat app e.g. WeChat, we could see the use and value of SMS decline, as is being observed in China. 

Without solving for the complexity and obstacles in connecting internet devices to the legacy PSTN network, TWLO's value add is greatly diminished, and whilst they still provide API services for apps such as Whatsapp, FB etc, this relies on the communication being routed through TWLO as part of an omni-channel solution. If Whatsapp reaches out directly to the end customer through their platform, TWLO is not involved in that transaction. 

This also increases the reliance on big tech to allow TWLO to provide these services. 

On one hand, SMS usage in the near term is forecast to grow, and tools such as TWLO's APIs will unlock effective, powerful and hopefully two-engagement that benefits both business and customer. The use cases are just getting started. On the other hand, I can see a world where the pace of SMS obsolescence increases as we become saturated with marketing and often unwanted notifications, and we slowly migrate to different applications/platforms for our real communications, relegating the SMS app to the attic in our phones, only checking it occasionally when we know we are expecting something. This decline in eyeballs would then reduce the effectiveness of SMS for businesses and marketers, diverting these communications to a realm where TWLO has limited ability to monetise. 

I don't know if i'm just missing something or it's just me, I haven't read much debate/discussion on this when reading about TWLO so just curious on people's thoughts.",TWLO: What happens when SMS becomes obsolete?,,

I got a few shares of AAPL (I’m a total fanboy) at 135 and quickly learned I should have DCA’d. I started to diversify, adding in small $10-20 portions of GOOG, AMZN and FB here or there—whenever I saw a dip ($50 in each so far).

I have 10 shares of FNMA at about $2 (my friend from college was convinced it will moon...)

I’m considering UAL as a reopening play, and want to diversify out of just tech. Maybe into alternative energy/sustainability projects, and perhaps in gene mapping and editing techs but I don’t really know where to start.

45,2021-05-17 15:20:07,t3_nej11l,nej11l,stocks,"Retail stocks have been on a surge in the past 6 months. The biggest gainers in this space are DDS (Dillards) and PLCE (The Children's Place). Both could be considered boomer stocks that still rely on brick & mortar, especially Dillards. But both company's are carrying strong tailwinds from reopening and pent up demands.

PLCE has Q1 earnings coming up on May 20. PLCE mainly sells children's clothing. And I think analysts and investors are pricing in the next 4 months of growth as COVID is lifting, kids will need new clothing for summer (parties, birthdays, etc) as well as back to school in 4 months. PLCE in Q4 reported that their digital sales are up, but that they're revenues are still down. Macro factors, they're still worried about declining birth rates. Since January, PLCE is up almost 70%, mostly through reliable increasing revenues and earnings. Despite revenue not beating expectations, they're still doing well.

One thing to note with PLCE using their Q4 2020 returns: https://investor.childrensplace.com/static-files/26f7ea63-8d41-481a-984d-b53f68e13032

In February 2, 2019 they made $1.9B in sales with profit of $111M.  At that time, their stock was trading at about $100. They're on track to hit that number in 2021 and even surpass it based on analyst estimates. We could see 50% more upside from PLCE if their Q1 results show anywhere near $600M in sales.

DDS is a different story. DDS just announced a $500M share buyback and a $0.15 dividend. This was on Friday. And since then, DDS has jumped almost 40%. It opened Friday at $107 and its currently trading at $142. On Friday, it was trading as low as $100 at one point.

A $500M share buyback will be done at the market:
https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dillards-announces-stock-buyback-worth-%24500m-to-pay-%240.15-quarterly-dividend-2021-05-17

> Under the new buyback program, the company can acquire securities via open market transactions as well as private negotiations.

The dividend is payable on August for investors as of June 30.

The P/S ratios of the department store industry are between 0.28 and 0.50, with DDS being on the high side. But their revenues are increasing and with a share buyback that will lower their total float, thus decreasing their P/S, DDS could be an exciting story. The funny thing is that DDS options have spiked in IV, so I would probably buy shares to avoid any major losses due to stock dump after June 30's ex-dividend date.

If you're looking non-tech plays to diversify your portfolio, but still have some aggressive gains, PLCE and DDS may be nice additions.


Anecdotally, many states are reducing social distancing restrictions. I could see department stores getting lots of benefits from traditional forms of shopping. I don't think the retail-pocalypse has destroyed the entire industry quite yet.",Specialty retail stocks are bumping: PLCE and DDS particularly,,

Or we have ORC which pays 14-15%. Also pays monthly. Company seems solid and both have a long MR of 30% so I can margin them both the same to get my levered dividends for more gains. 

Now my question is for the math and tax experts. Since this money can’t go into a TFSA as mine is currently maxed out, what is the better play for yeild after the tax mans comes for his fair share?

51,2021-05-17 16:05:08,t3_nek5vq,nek5vq,stocks,"Hi all, going to keep this short as there is already some great DD on Myovant Sciences out there on Reddit and some recent articles, plus I’m not a financial advisor. 

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company’s end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment* 

&#x200B;

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe  

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)  

By July 1:  Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application  

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant.  Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner  (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** 

EU and FDA approvals for drug candidates are expected within the next 2 weeks and could propel this to the moon.

58,2021-05-17 16:56:07,t3_nelhgz,nelhgz,stocks,"So right now, the mainstream narrative is that inflation is going to run red hot mostly due to a rally in commodity prices. This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why apparently, tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example). 

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.  

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html). 

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html). 

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand.

62,2021-05-17 17:44:17,t3_nemqxc,nemqxc,stocks,"If you are looking for moons and rocketships this is not the due diligence for you. This is the due diligence for those who want to round out their portfolio with an unexciting albeit profitable upstream energy stock that won a huge race for something you likely aren't even aware of: the highly profitable DJ Basin. 

BCEI's current price is 41.90, and its forecasted range is 47.00 to 66.00. [Forecasts](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=BCEI), and more [forecasts](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bcei/analyst-research).

Importantly, they have recently participated in a 1-for-1 with another company and I believe the market simply hasn't internalized their new size.

2021 estimated EBITDA puts them at 3.4x as last Friday's close. This is inexpensive vs the greater U.S. upstream peer group and, importantly, compares to 4.1x standalone BCEI. In other words, if the new company is simply valued in the same ballpark as BCEI alone there's significant upside, and there's nothing about the upcoming merger that should indicate a discount. In fact the opposite is the true, consolidation demands a premium.

A similar conclusion can be reached from a DCF valuation, but given the recent merger I think it's more useful to observe pre-merger 10-year free cash flow is a hair under 1 billion. The target should be 50 regardless of the merger, so depending on how you peg the risks with the merger, well, it's up to you. There is a world where BCEI is like an upstream energy company of this size and trades at 70 with a DCF like all the rest. 

**Who Should Get This Stock?**

If you're looking to get rich fast, the NBA and NHL playoffs are just around the corner and sportsbooks are taking bets 24/7. If you're looking to invest, consult with your financial advisor about BCEI. 

I invested because it is something I can forget about for a few months, and when I come back after the ex-dividend date I accept the five or six percent growth, the three percent dividend, and before I know it I'm up 50% and I want to share some good news about a stock that defines the unsexy, good business practices of upstream energy in Colorado. 

**What's BCEI?**

BCEI is a pure-play rural DJ Basin operator. ""Pure-play"" as in they focus solely on extracting oil and natural gas from Denver's Denver-Julesburg (""DJ"") Basin. The tl;dr is BCEI possesses a lot of rural Colorado acreage plus very low operating costs plus significant free cash flow. Combined, it equals it's still undervalued compared to peers in spite of the run up the last few months. 

They will also be the first net zero upstream Colorado company, using offsets to become carbon neutral. Aside from being just good stewards of the environment, they are able to do this because of the fundamentally sound structure of their company. Compared to peers they have less wellheads that make more money. In the DJ Basin, if your wellheads make a lot of money it's because they produce more oil than natural gas. Natural gas is typically put right into the atmosphere and uncaptured. Because their wellheads are more oil than wasted natural gas, they cost less than their peers and they can afford to invest in these fixed wellheads rather than running from spot to spot letting natural gas get fired off into the air. [Source](https://ibb.co/5krgsGP)

**Upside?**

The reason I love BCEI is because consolidation is the name of the game in the DJ, and they have the best chance to be the big fish that eats all the smaller fish. Whatever company is able to gobble up the other fish the fastest is going to make a lot of money, partially because the DJ Basin is already profitable and partially because increased oil prices are going to push margins up.

The reason BCEI is going to win consolidation is because they developed zero debt during the downturn, and they are already swinging their free cashflow and zero debt around in a huge way. 

They are going to combine with a smaller, more debt-heavy, competitor and the combined company, to be named Civitas, will create the largest upstream player in the DJ Basin. It's going to be a 1-for-1 merger. This follows after the outright purchase of Highpoint several months ago. [Picture of acreage](https://ibb.co/yRNSXnR)

The annual dividend of $1.40 recently announced by BCEI will be increased to $1.60 as soon as the deal closes. Notably, of the significant expected free cash flow for the combined company, the dividend, at the new higher level, only represents an annual outlay of just under $100 mm.

**Downside?**

Downside is that they go sideways, maybe lose their luster, and go back to being severely undervalued rather than their current ""normal"" of simply undervalued. This isn't financial advice, good stocks go tits up all the time. Shit happens.

**Conclusion**

What are they going to do with the rest of the cash? In the past they've played it smart buying high quality companies in their market, like HighPoint Resources, and used these synergies to grow YoY. For example last quarter, with quarterly earnings of $0.88 per share, they beat estimates of $0.73-.76 per share. Their forward looking guidance indicates continued success. Chances are there is a special dividend and/or continued consolidation, which is where the upside comes into play.","$BCEI DD -- No Moons or Rockets, Just Classic DD About an Undervalued Energy Company",,

I use mostly Yahoo Finance and [Investing.com](https://Investing.com) for the economical and financial part, and mostly WeBull for the charts.

73,2021-05-17 20:21:09,t3_neqr5i,neqr5i,stocks,"'Investing.com – Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares rose in a weak market after Morgan Stanley 's (NYSE:MS) latest bullish target for the stock: $6,000 by 2023.

According to StreetInsider, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak reiterated his overweight rating on Amazon with a target of $4,500, while going on to make a case for the $6,000 per share mark.

The online retailer and cloud services provider currently trades at around 1.2 times 2022 earnings on a PEG basis, an approximately 30% discount to its median tech peer group.

Nowak believes that with Amazon’s scaling profitability and given its discount relative to the peer group, the stock would warrant a $4,500 level at even 1.7 times PEG, according to StreetInsider. But this may not be enough.

Factors like a large addressable market across Amazon’s business lines, including retail, advertising, logistics, healthcare, cloud, autonomous driving and the rising user base of its Prime service all combine to ask for an even higher target for the company’s stock price, the analyst believes, as per StreetInsider.

""These factors could justify a higher PEG, and a PEG of ~2-2.5X would imply a ~$5,000-$6,000 share price within the next 12 months (potentially a double from here),"" Nowak wrote.

76,2021-05-17 20:49:31,t3_nerh13,nerh13,stocks,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 17, 2021**

The market fell modestly on Monday, as concerns over rising inflation, marked by a higher than expected print in the April Consumer Price Index (CPI), continued. Technology stocks continued their volatility, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) going as low as 1.42% down intraday before recovering and closing 0.59% down. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.26% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed.

Stocks are coming into this week on the heels of an extremely choppy trading period recently, which saw the SPY pulling back 4% before recovering Thursday and Friday of last week after the April CPI and Producer Price Index (PPI) came in higher than expected. The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

The PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers have increased more than expected. Market participants are concerned that high levels of inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. 

While the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents. 

There are several factors, in my opinion, contributing to the rise of inflation. First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. 

Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. One prominent example you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt—incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs—recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, “Given the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying “Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.

**Highlights**

* On Monday morning AT&T (T) and Discovery, Inc. (DISCA) announced a deal under which AT&T's WarnerMedia will be spun off and combined with Discovery in a new standalone media company.

The live TV streaming provider posted blowout financial results after Tuesday's market close. The stock had hit a six-month low earlier in the trading day. 

Coming through with its third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year top-line growth since going public late last year, fuboTV was full of positive surprises. A historic sequential increase in subscribers during a seasonally sleepy quarter. A big boost to its full-year guidance. FuboTV had [a lot to prove](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/11/fubotv-stock-has-a-lot-to-prove-this-week/) heading into this critical financial update, and it delivered. 

## Playing to win 

There's a lot of skeptic silencing in fuboTV's first-quarter performance. Revenue soared 135% to $119.7 million, well ahead of the 98% to 102% that it was [forecasting in early March](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/03/good-luck-betting-against-fubotv-stock/). This is the second time in a row that fuboTV has put up lowball guidance that it beat with ease. It's a trend that bears noting -- and respecting. 

There's still plenty of red ink here, but with operating expenses only up 80% relative to the 135% top-line burst we're seeing net loss and adjusted EBITDA margins improving. FuboTV's average revenue per user is rising, and against that welcome trend the live TV platform is clocking in with a sequential improvement in subscriber acquisition costs. 

We're seeing tailwinds riding tailwinds here. FuboTV now has 590,430 subs on its books, 105% more than it had a year earlier. Revenue is growing even faster on the heels of a 131% surge in subscription revenue and ad revenue more than tripling. Another neat tidbit on its subscriber count is that it's also 43,000 higher than it was in December. This is the first time that it actually posted a sequential increase in accounts during the first three months of the calendar year. 

FuboTV now sees 830,000 to 850,000 subscribers by year-end, up from the 760,000 to 770,000 it was targeting just two months ago. This is old hat for investors as fuboTV jacked up its 2020 subscriber goal in October, November, and January last time out. This should also be a reminder that any likely revision in a couple of months will probably be higher yet again.

With average revenue per user approaching $70 a month between subscriptions and ads, can things get even better? Well, fuboTV is still on track to roll out a free-to-play interactive gaming app that will enhance the live sports it streams through more than three dozen channels. The stakes will be raised in the fourth quarter when Fubo Sportsbook launches in markets where it can clear legal hurdles. Fantasy sports and then actual wagering will make fuboTV even more money than they are right now, but more importantly, they're going to improve engagement. 

FuboTV has been one of the wildest stocks since its [IPO](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/ipo-stocks/) seven months ago. It was a six-bagger at one point, only to shed more than three-quarters of its value by Tuesday's market open. A blowout quarter is the perfect cure to market indifference. Now it's up to fuboTV to make the most of its new momentum to start winning again.",$$FUBO Has Finally Bottomed Out... Charts Looking Amazing,,

171,2021-05-18 06:01:00,t1_gyjen23,,stocks,"Let's simplify the issue to a basic example. This is usually a good way to get the crux of the question.

Let's say I establish a shell company and I contribute 100k in cash to shareholder equity. Nothing else. If I were to sell this shell company, I would always receive 100k for that company, as it has 100k in cash in assets and 100k in shareholder equity (let's not assume transactional costs, value of the name or anything else, let's just look at the balance sheet). Any owner could immediately reduce the equity by 100k and pay himself 100k in cash. Therefore the company is worth 100k. Owning the company is essentially the same as owning 100k in cash.

Now let's say that instead I use the company to buy back 50% of the shares from me for 50k. I will receive 50k in cash, the company receives 50% of its shares. If I were now to sell the company, I would get 50k for it, as the company has 50k in cash in assets and 50k in equity. The fact that the company could sell 50% of its shares means nothing for its valuation. Just as the technical fact, that the company could raise 1M or 1B does not make the shell company worth 1M or 1B. If it did raise 1B in cash, yes its valuation would go to 1B, but not just because it owns its own shares.

If in this example the company had retained its valuation of 100k after buying back 50% of its shares for 50k, I would have just made 50k out of thin air. As I physically received 50k for selling my shares to the company, yet still own the entire company. It's not logical that I just increased my wealth by doing nothing else than exchange shares with my own company.

Honestly this is beyond ludicrous where this sub has gotten to. If a company uses its cash to decrease share holder equity, thereby returning wealth to its shareholders, fundamentally the valuation of the company goes down. How could anyone think it wouldn't? If a company pays dividend from its cash, their valuation goes down. If a company pays wages to its employees, the valuation of the company goes down. It's a cost to the company. Money leaving the company. It's a 1-1 change between cash outflow and valuation.

Now, obviously investor sentiment and other factors not fundamentally tied to the balance sheet of the company have an effect on valuations on a stock market. Raising cash could scare away previous investors or it could create stronger belief in its growth. Paying investors through dividends or share buybacks could both improve the return on assets or it could put the company in trouble (liquidity issues, hamper growth etc). But what I am assuming here is that board decisions regarding capital allocations are (near) optimal and marginal changes in capital structure do not have a fundamental underlying impact on the company. All that changes is cash on hand.",,gyjen23,t1_gyhqcz2

These are some highlights of the most shocking adaptations.

U.S. law has long prohibited American companies from turning over data to Chinese law enforcement. But Apple and the Chinese government have made an unusual arrangement to get around American laws.

In China, Apple has ceded legal ownership of its customers’ data to Guizhou-Cloud Big Data, or GCBD, a company owned by the government of Guizhou Province, whose capital is Guiyang. Apple recently required its Chinese customers to accept new iCloud terms and conditions that list GCBD as the service provider and Apple as “an additional party.” Apple told customers the change was to “improve iCloud services in China mainland and comply with Chinese regulations.”

China hide process’

In early 2018, Guo Wengui, an exiled Chinese billionaire, was spending much of his time in Manhattan trying to broadcast his claims of corruption inside the Communist Party. His latest effort was an iPhone app in China that delivered those claims.

Before his app even became available on iPhones, the Chinese government was trying to block it. Shortly after Mr. Guo applied to the App Store, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the government’s internet regulator, told Apple it wanted the app rejected. It was unclear how the officials knew about it.

Those events and the chain reaction they set off inside Apple were laid out in court documents last week in a wrongful-termination case against the company. The documents and interviews shine a light on a bureaucracy inside Apple designed to censor and block apps, often proactively, to appease the Chinese government.

On Feb. 4, 2018, shortly after the Chinese authorities demanded that Mr. Guo’s app be rejected, an Apple manager emailed a colleague with a question: Did Mr. Guo belong on Apple’s “China sensitivities list,” along with the likes of Falun Gong — the Chinese spiritual movement — and the Dalai Lama?

The colleague replied that Mr. Guo probably should be on the list, given that he had been spreading unverifiable defamatory stories about Chinese officials. She suggested that the question be elevated to Apple’s “executive review board,” a group of executives who decide the trickiest App Store issues, including top deputies to Mr. Cook.

Two weeks later, the board said Mr. Guo belonged on Apple’s China blacklist. Apple employees added his name to the company’s internal “Chinese App Store Removal wiki page,” according to the documents, as well as a software program that would automatically tag any apps that mentioned him.

Six months later, Mr. Guo submitted his app again, with changes to elude Apple’s software. Trieu Pham, an app reviewer in Cupertino, was assigned the app. He didn’t find anything that violated Apple’s rules. On Aug. 2, he approved it.

Three weeks later, Trystan Kosmynka, Apple’s app review chief, sent an email to several managers at 2:32 a.m. The subject line was “Hot: Guo.” The Chinese government had spotted Mr. Guo’s new app, and Mr. Kosmynka wanted to know how it had gotten published.

“This app and any Guo Wengui app cannot be on the China store,” he wrote, according to the emails filed in the court case. “Can we put the necessary pieces in place to prevent that ASAP.”

Apple pulled the app and began investigating. A resulting report said the app was published because the “China hide process was not followed,” according to court documents. It said that Mr. Pham, the app reviewer, should have sent the app to Apple’s Chinese language specialists, who had been trained on which topics to block in the Chinese App Store, including Mr. Guo.

When Apple managers questioned Mr. Pham, he told them the app didn’t violate any policies. The managers responded that the app criticized the Chinese government, Mr. Pham said in court documents, and that this was enough for rejection.

Six months later, Apple fired Mr. Pham. In response, he sued the company, accusing it of pushing him out to appease the Chinese government.

Apple said it removed Mr. Guo’s app in China because it had determined it was illegal there. Apple said it fired Mr. Pham because of poor performance.

Mr. Guo’s media outlets have a history of peddling misinformation. The exact nature of the apps in the 2018 case was unclear, though court documents said they discussed Chinese Communist Party corruption.

Phillip Shoemaker, who ran Apple’s App Store from 2009 to 2016, said in an interview that Apple lawyers in China gave his team a list of topics that couldn’t appear in apps in the country, including Tiananmen Square and independence for Tibet and Taiwan. He said Apple’s policy was matter-of-fact: If the lawyers believed a topic was off-limits in China, then Apple would remove it there.

On Chinese iPhones, Apple forbids apps about the Dalai Lama while hosting those from the Chinese paramilitary group accused of detaining and abusing Uyghurs, an ethnic minority group in China.

The company has also helped China spread its view of the world. Chinese iPhones censor the emoji of the Taiwanese flag, and their maps suggest Taiwan is part of China. For a time, simply typing the word “Taiwan” could make an iPhone crash, according to Patrick Wardle, a former hacker at the National Security Agency.

Sometimes, Mr. Shoemaker said, he was awakened in the middle of the night with demands from the Chinese government to remove an app. If the app appeared to mention the banned topics, he would remove it, but he would send more complicated cases to senior executives, including Mr. Cue and Mr. Schiller.

Apple resisted an order from the Chinese government in 2012 to remove The Times’s apps. But five years later, it ultimately did. Mr. Cook approved the decision, according to two people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Apple recently began disclosing how often governments demand that it remove apps. In the two years ending June 2020, the most recent data available, Apple said it approved 91 percent of the Chinese government’s app-takedown requests, removing 1,217 apps.

In every other country combined over that period, Apple approved 40 percent of requests, removing 253 apps. Apple said that most of the apps it removed for the Chinese government were related to gambling or pornography or were operating without a government license, such as loan services and livestreaming apps.

Yet a Times analysis of Chinese app data suggests those disclosures represent a fraction of the apps that Apple has blocked in China. Since 2017, roughly 55,000 active apps have disappeared from Apple’s App Store in China, according to a Times analysis of data compiled by Sensor Tower, an app data firm. Most of those apps have remained available in other countries.

An Increasing Number of Apps Are Disappearing in China

Number of apps that disappeared from the iOS App Store in China by month through February 2021
More than 35,000 of those apps were games, which in China must get approval from regulators. The remaining 20,000 cut across a wide range of categories. Apps that mapped users’ runs, edited selfies or taught sexual positions were removed. So were apps that allowed users to message privately, share documents and browse websites the Chinese government had blocked. More than 600 news apps also disappeared.

Apple disputed those figures, saying that some developers remove their own apps from China. Apple said that since 2017, it had taken down 70 news apps in response to Chinese government demands.

The discrepancy between Apple’s disclosures and the Times analysis is in part because Apple is removing apps before China’s internet censors even complain. Apple does not disclose such takedowns in its statistics.

Mr. Shoemaker said he and his team rationalized removing apps by framing them as simply enforcing a country’s laws. Similar steps were taken in places like Saudi Arabia and Russia, he said. “At the same time, we didn’t want to get hauled up in front of the Senate to talk about why we’re quote ‘censoring apps in China,’” he said. “It was a tightrope we had to walk.”",,gyjhpbp,t3_nf1xgu

If I hold 10 companies that are all different in terms of market cap, industry, capital structure, and value generation for shareholders, I'd consider that diversified, whereas if I owned ARK+FAANG, I wouldn't consider that particularly diversified regardless of the fact that that consists of a great many companies.

301,2021-05-18 08:24:16,t1_gyjoqpn,,stocks,"Don’t worry. It’s hard to see your investments go down, especially when you first start investing, but it’s perfectly normal. The market goes down half the time (literally) and something like 30% of all years lose money. It all even out over the long run (10+ years). Just take advantage of the opportunity to buy at a cheaper price (and higher yield).

Here are some things you can do to limit investing related anxiety.

1: invest in a globally diversified index fund. When our investments go down the biggest question we often ask is if there is something wrong with our strategy. Can’t go wrong if you own everything. All you need is to be bullish on the world.

2: check your portfolio less often. I only look at my portfolio when I deposit money, and on my stocks when the quarterly reports come out. Can’t worry about your stocks going down if you don’t know that they are down.

3: Look at your stocks as businesses. When you buy a stock you are entitled to a portion of their future earnings. If you buy a stock that yields you 5% a year, and it falls 50%, you can now buy it at a 10% yield. That’s twice as much money.

4: Limit your downside with alternative assets.  Assets like gold, commodities, consumer stables, liquidity providers, bonds or reits may lower your downside risk.

5: Understand that most stocks go down. I don’t know any long term investors that doesn’t have a losing stock in their portfolio. So it’s highly unlikely that everything you own will go up at the same time, even for a short period.

Hope it helps:)",,gyjoqpn,t3_nf1bj6

There are three options when investing in something, you can either understand a market and its companies, understand the market but not its companies or not understand the market nor its companies. By understanding, I mean you've done tens of hours of research and you know most of what's going on in that specific market and/or company.

If you understand a market, but not the companies, you should buy an ETF. For example I've spent a lot of time researching the potential of genomics and understand it's a huge opportunity, but I don't understand the companies well enough to pick one or even a few companies, so I'm better off holding ARKG. The diversification is protection against my ignorance of the companies, not the market.

If you don't just understand the market, but also the companies you should just pick the best positioned company and not diversify at all. Unless you think there's a significant chance that you will be wrong, in which case you have to ask yourself if you truly understand the company.

If you don't understand the market at all, you shouldn't be investing in it in the first place. Not through an ETF or anything else (unless it's indirectly through an S&P index fund).

Obviously you can never be 100% sure a company or market will do well, but that's a part of investing. The goal is not to get it right 100% of the time, but to get it right most of the time. If you do that, you don't need to diversify past your ignorance.",,gyjpy12,t3_neytcm

Everyone is now suspicious of Elon's motives now. Is he trolling or serious about dogecoin. Was he ignorant about bitcoin's energy consumption or is playing the long con and going to introduce Tesla solar mining rigs? Is the SEC going to go after Elon again?

I gotta be honest, headlines like ""Tesla made more money from flipping than selling cars"" don't really add to investor confidence.

Elon is a brilliant engineer and yes he is one of he cofounders of Paypal. But I seriously question his knowledge on cryptocurrency.

For years, Elon was not a believer in crypto, and only changed his tune during the recent crypto bull-run.

Michael can keep ringing the alarm of the regulatory credits Tesla gets. But under a Biden admnistration,and an EV infrastructure bill under way, the government is not going to stop this practice anytime soon,and by the time they do Tesla will already be well positioned as an EV leader in a recovered economy to where they won't need them.

Also if these companies mentioned above have long positions and control CNBC then it would make sense that they are trying to push people away from gme and amc and into silver. Also the fed can only keep prices low while there is supply, silver demand is outpacing supply! Silver is shorted and has seen big gains! Most Reddit silver folks buy physical, or pslv with 401k.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

My assumption being that you have a million dollars after taxes, and no debts owed. The best place you can stick your money if you were trying to maintain that level of wealth, is in the stock market.

If you're not concerned with growing your wealth at some crazy multiple, buy a large ETF such as spy, QQQ, or one of the other ones that floats your boat.

These won't make you rich by any stretch of the imagination, but over a long period of time you will have more money then you started with because over long enough periods if time stocks only go up.


Some people are going to suggest real estate but it's a horrible suggestion. Most people who don't come from money ate idiots when it comes to money. There are so many ways you can lose money in real estate if you don't know what you're doing the only real answer is the stock market.

Can anyone actually make a bullish case for Tesla at this point? Their assets are 56 billion and their market cap is 555 billion. Their revenue is 52b. They have under 2% of the vehicle market. Compare this to GM who's got over 200 billion in assets, generates 120b+ in revenue, and their market cap is a mere 86b. It's just fucking nonsense.

So what you're saying at this point if you buy Tesla instead of GM is: ""I am more confident Muskdaddy can harvest $10 of value from $1 than GM can harvest $0.43 of value from $1.""

I think Elon Musk is pretty good and GM is not great, but I don't think he's 20x better. That's a HUGE target for GM to hit. Keep in mind, when we're talking about management of very large companies it's a pretty narrow band of difference in management capabilities. Shareholders and boards will pay top dollar for management that can harvest 1.1x or 1.2x more value from a dollar than their competitors. We're talking about the Alan Mulally's of the world. CEO's credited with turning around 2 or 3 companies.

The greatest businessmen of all time such as Rockefeller, Ford, Carnegie, Vanderbilt... these guys harvested between 2 and 3 times more value from a dollar than their contemporaries. And that made them the richest, most powerful men in the world capable of making and unmaking *entire nations* in their era.

In your Google example they did a 2-1 split with the payout being the newly created class of shares being the non-voting ones.  This gave everyone who owned Google the same number of non-voting shares as they had voting shares which is why the price stayed the same.  The reason they did this was insiders wanted to sell but they did not want to dilute their voting rights so they sold some of their newly created voting shares.  I believe that newly created stock options and grants given to employees are now the non-voting shares also to not dilute the voting stake the founders have.  

As for BRK here is the google summary:

Berkshire Hathaway has two classes of common stock designated Class A and Class B. In 2009, a share of Class B common stock has the rights of 1/30th of a share of Class A common stock except that a Class B share has 1/200th of the voting rights of a Class A share (rather than 1/30th of the vote).

all major car manufacturers have spent billions - either by themselves or indirectly via SW develoopment companies, startups, you name it - to get self driving vehicles going. none have yet to produce REAL autonomy. 

most systems ""kinda"" work, but only in harshly controlled environments and under specific circumstances. 

those companies have been at it for decades. 

and then - out of the blue - comes TSLA and claims to have solved all the problems all other manufacturers, developers etc couldn´t. yeah. 

If GOOGL hasn´t made their autonomous driving system (waymo) public and couldn´t get it done for mass production, I do not believe one second that TSLA was / is able to do it. for the simple fact that that GOOGL is leaps and bounds ahead of almost anyone when it comes to Machine Learning and AI. they also have some of the largest amounts of data collected when it comes to traffic. (every android phone constantly sends data. every Iphone with google maps installed does the same). plus data from their own cars. 

most of the capabilities TSLA claims to be ""state of the art"" is available in most modern cars as well. nothing revolutionary about anything they claim if you look and compare closely.

For those who have never actually looked into this and are just taking some random media's word for it, Tesla doesn't market the system as ""self-driving"", they market it as follows:

> * Navigate on Autopilot
>* Auto Lane Change
>* Autopark
>* Summon
>* Full Self-Driving Computer
>* Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control

> The currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous. The activation and use of these features are dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of human drivers as demonstrated by billions of miles of experience, as well as regulatory approval, which may take longer in some jurisdictions. As these self-driving features evolve, your car will be continuously upgraded through over-the-air software updates.

So they market the capabilities as ""autopilot"". For those who don't know what the term autopilot means:

> An autopilot is a system used to control the trajectory of an aircraft, marine craft or spacecraft without requiring constant manual control by a human operator. Autopilots do not replace human operators. Instead, the autopilot assists the operator's control of the vehicle, allowing the operator to focus on broader aspects of operations (for example, monitoring the trajectory, weather and on-board systems).

This is exactly what Tesla's software does.

Your retina has 120m rod cells, and 6m cone cells.

So, for simplicity, we will call is 125m inputs

You have two eyes for binocular vision.

Your brain actually flips the image from your eyes (because it is actually upside down due to lensing), and dynamically integrates the two separate images to build a 3d model of your field of vision.

Your vision automatically also categorizes everything it sees (being prey for billions of years makes that extremely important). 

All of this happens without you thinking about it, with almost zero delay.

Machines are REALLY good at rigid analysis. Really, really good at that.

But recognizing a cat? Especially when that cat doesn't look like a house cat?

Finally, this is one of those things that, until you have children, you won't understand how difficult / time consuming it is for the human brain to develop this spatial sense area of their brain.

(oh, and really cool info, blind people that use echo location actually use the same area of the brain for building the spatial map as with vision. This indicates there is something special about this area of the brain for creating 3d maps of the environment)",,gykdxx4,t1_gyk86gt

2: the value is either way completely wrong because they assume exercising the contracts on an assumed strike price, so literally an assumption based on an assumption.

For å kunne aktivere nye funksjoner må de oppnå langt større pålitelighet enn menneskelige sjåfører, og dette må dokumenteres gjennom milliarder av kjørte kilometer. I tillegg må funksjonene bli lovlige å bruke, hvilket kan ta lengre tid i noen områder enn andre.

The first thing that stands out is the shareholders’ equity, which was negative in 2019 and barely shifted to the positive side in 2020. This inflates the ROE (about 35% in 2020 according to my calculation) while the ROIC is significantly lower due to the large amount of debt (about 3%).

Now the near-zero book value and the high debt seems to me like a huge red flag. If one looks at the cash AbbVie is generating, their operational cash flow in 2020 was $17.6 billion and free cash flow was $16.8 billion. About $7.7 billion of that FCF goes out as dividends. The long-term debt interest payments for the next years will be, according to the notes on their balance sheet, in the range of $2.8 billion annually (paid from OFC) and the principal payments $8.4 billion in 2021 and a massive $12.4 billion in 2022 (paid from FCF). That means practically no cash will be left after debt principals and dividend payments to invest in growth, or for buybacks for that matter.

Now this looks like a textbook value trap to me. However, it’s one of the few companies Berkshire has been buying this year so they seem confident. In addition, according to their annual report, they still manage to get cheap loans from the market, so lenders are not seeing them as a risky investment either.

So the question is, what am I missing on their balance sheet? Where’s the value that Buffett is seeing? Is this just a dividend play? Trying to learn this stuff here so would appreciate if somebody can point me to the right direction!",A question about AbbVie balance sheet: what am I missing?,,

See what happened to railroads stocks in the early 1900s, and the car stocks in the 1950s. 

If you think these metrics are able to be maintained, honestly, tell me how. Even Amazon, a company spending billions year over year in R&D, was considered by many (at 100-200 PE) to be overvalued as fuck even after proving they were a cash-cow with AWS, Amazon website, etc. They are even 2x as profitable as Tesla!

 I'm far from thinking that Telsa is dying. But thinking it will become a SUSTAINABLE trillion dollar+ company while:

1. Having a 3% profitability

2. Crazy priced-in valuations (because of hype and 'a sentiment for the future

4. Having an almost bigger market cap than the 12 largests automakers in the world that sell over 90% of the cars 

5. Not really having a monopoly in the EV sector

Tesla is not only an automaker, but without this source of revenue, the company WILL not be able to sustain its growth. So the people saying 'your point is not relevant, Tesla doesn't only make cars' are wrong.

I'm not anti-Tesla, I'm just against betting for the future when it has been proved and demonstrated than jumping on the trend, after it has already exploded, will net you lower returns over the years. You bet money last year? Nice. Betting this year? Meh, it is a bubble only waiting to explode. In the short term, I guess it could rise. 1-2 years maybe? But give it 10-20 years and I guarantee you Tesla will not be where you're expecting it to be. 

Only a 8% compound annual growth rate would put the company at a 2.8T valuation. How would they achieve that? Hell, I think they never will. But whatever, I'm a gay-bear.",,gykp9e2,t1_gyk9jrt

975,2021-05-18 14:49:50,t1_gykpfhu,,stocks,"If you are dead set in not selling your winner then there’s little point in selling your losers since the max you can write off in your taxes is 1.5k (if single, 3k if not) – unless you are sure that your losers won’t see a better day (realize a 5k loss next year is still better than realize a 10k loss this year even with the deduction).  I would hold on to the losers unless you need the money to do whatever (including adding to your winners).

Tax harvesting is a way to reduce your realized gain and to limit your risk  in questionable stocks.  If there’s no realized gain, it makes little sense in selling for a loss – unless you think the stock won’t recover and are OK with opportunity cost.

In the long run, stocks go up – unless the company has fundamental issues.  I hold RTX for the long time waiting for it to get out of the 50s.  I also held XOM waiting for it to get of the 40s for months.

Now, waiting for FSLY to get back to the 90s may take a few years.  The same amount of time may be needed for RKT to get back to the 30s.",,gykpfhu,t3_nf1yn9

986,2021-05-18 14:54:06,t1_gykq23m,,stocks,"No. Semiconductor foundries (ASML's customers) have dedicated an absurd amount of money to chip capacity expansion in the near-to-mid-term.  TSMC is spending $100B over the next 3 years, Samsung I believe they said either $100B or $200B over the next decade, and Intel is building new fabs right now for $20B plus more investments are likely on the way. A substantial proportion of capacity expansion is spent on equipment (what ASML sells) because it's wildly expensive to get equipment that can fabricate leading-edge semiconductors. I believe one tool can cost $10M-$20M and that price goes up substantially with each new iteration of chips - look up Moore's Second Law. 

Another reason the stocks are priced like this is because semiconductor equipment is so fucking complicated that each market is dominated by one or two companies which usually combine for 90% market share, meaning hella pricing power. Also pro tip don't look at trailing PE of 50 but forward PE of 38 or so. Companies aren't valued based on what they did last year but what they're going to do in the future.",,gykq23m,t1_gykbb83

989,2021-05-18 14:56:22,t1_gykqdwt,,stocks,"Uhhh from what I've seen, you've got to spread it around. Realistically the banks don't insure the whole thing in one account. Let's say you have 3 mill. And you use someone like (insert random bank) bank of America. Each separate account insures uo to 250k (from what i've seen) using the FDIC insurance. So you can have multiple checking accounts insured to that amount. But i hear you saying ""That seems messy! Thats 8 or 10  accounts with one or multiple banks! Is there an easier way?"". Well bud it's the first way i found out how to protect multiple millions. The other way I'm learning about and looking into,which i must admit, is wayyyyy freaking better is something called ""security backed lines of credit"". Get this: you can have x amount of dollars in the stock market to grow and be untouched (like he suggested some broad etf's ! *wink wink*) but they will give you up too 80%(this really depends on THE BANK,and other factors like how much money you put in, the market value and volatility of stock you picked, credit score(i think), and means to pay back (like if you have more money just sitting in bank account with them not being used as a line of credit). This gives you a win-win scenario. You get liquidity to use atleast  30-80% of your net worth for growing your new found wealth (or living off) and you get some safety/security in leaving it in a Stock or portfolio you hand picked. I know one bank in particular would give this line to minimums of 250k and up to 80% of that 250k.
