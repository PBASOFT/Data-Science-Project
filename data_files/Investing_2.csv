Leveraged ETFs only provide amplified daily exposure. Circuit breaker hits way before the market sees a 40% drawdown. Even with all the volatility of 2020, the largest daily drop of SPY was 12% on 3/16, SSO lost ~24% that day. 

And this is what I meant when I said ""2x the volatility"".

> ... if it goes back up 40% you end up with only 28% of your original money.

Yes, that is how compounding returns work. This has nothing to do with survivorship bias though. 

Survivorship bias would be a valid criticism if there were a bunch of 2x Leveraged S&P 500 ETFs that went bust, or if SSO would have went bust in some past time period, and we're overlooking those other funds or timeframes.",,

If the Fed tries to raise rates significantly to stop inflation, that would mean big trouble.

And this is the example:  


""Joe Taxpayer earned $35,000 in 2020. He pays 10% on the first $9,875 income and 12% on the income that comes after that. His total tax liability is $4,003.

If Joe sells an asset that produced a short-term capital gain of $1,000, then his tax liability rises by another $120 (i.e., 12% x $1,000). However, if Joe waits one year and a day to sell, then he pays 0% on the capital gain.""  


According to the article, ""short-term capital gains for assets held for less than a year are taxed at ordinary income rates""  


Here are the rates for 2020 income tax:

* 10% on income up to $9,875
* 12% on income over $9,875
* 22% on income over $40,125
* 24% on income over $85,525
* 32% on income over $163,300
* 35% on income over $207,350
* 37% on income over $518,400  


If Joe produced a short-term capital gain of $ 1,000 (which is lower than $9,875), isn't it true that he should have paid 10% of $1000 (equals $100), instead of $120?

Canadian National Railway. (CNI or CNR)

Just had a huge dip after the KCS offer. Perfect time to get in while the market is down.

If they dont get the railway, their SP should shoot back up. If they do get it, theyll have the first transcontinental railway going from across Canada down to Mexico.

You realize CN and CP also use trucks. So they too would be using these electric trucks or self driving trucks.

 You also forget there is a lot of time saved going by rail rather than by road.

Fundamentally, being over or under moving average for some time frame means literally that -- some force has pushed price above/below where it was over last <X> time window.  

How you trade that depends on your strategy, what market forces you can see at play (earnings, outlook, regulatory changes, sector rotation, etc). 

A bunch of the common numbers are popular because everyone knows other people are trading on them, so it's useful to watch them as well (even if you counter-trade).

Personally, I think the 200 day average is popular because it's a nice and round, and is near the 182 day average.  Why 182?  Cause that's 1/2 of a year.  Which means the 200d moving average does a nice job detecting cyclical changes as the human economy generally accelerates during spring/summer, and slows down during fall/winter.  

By tracking ""over or under compared to last half year"", you can detect how price is responding as the economy shifts gears, and decide if it's doing a better job of that than your baseline (S&P, US10Y, whatever you prefer to measure against).",,

The fed didn't do nearly enough in its last tapering program as it's balance sheet went from about $4.4T to $3.8T in two years. Equities might have performed well but they only reduced the balance sheet by 13%. 

Also, what were interest rates when these tapering periods were occurring? If the FFR was low then equities are going to be a more attractive investment regardless. 

If you don't think that selling trillions of dollars worth of the world's most liquid/invested asset like treasuries wouldn't have an impact, then why would the Fed have to taper? Why don't they just dump half a trillion a month and reduce their balance sheet to pre-GFC levels in six months?

My objectives? I want money to see a very dear person that's living in the US. They mean a lot to me and it's been a year since I don't see them. Possibly start a life with them right there in the US someday. Also, I would like to start my own videogame studio.

This creates what I would call market leverage — I could coin such a term because the collapse of an underlying asset, we will say Tesla for simplicity, would cause negative reverberations thoughtful the market that are beyond the decline in market cap of that individual stock. This may seem simple, but Burry’s point here is that there so so many index funds tied to volatile stocks (think ARK, moonshot, tqqq, and so on) that a simple decline of 20% of one stock has the ability to possibly create a sell-off due to investors seeing a marked decline in several funds do to one stock under performing. 

Though not as bad as MBS derivatives of 2008, this is an excellent insight as to the danger of putting all your eggs in one basket, likely without conscious effort to do so — especially for new investors simply buying funds that keep going all — all of which are concentrated on a pretty smal subset of funds that have had spectacular returns in sample periods.

Personally, I am concentrating on leveraged T bond funds in my retirement accounts and options on direxion leveraged shorts elsewhere, because I don’t see how M1 can increase indefinitely while artificially-suppressing interest rates without serious negative repercussions.

Within the category of equities, further diversification is achieved through holding potentially thousands of companies across all market sectors, large and small caps, as well as emerging markets and just global companies rather than just looking at home country bias.

Big picture look is that those bonds and equities are supposed to be uncorrelated asset classes, and in the event of a crash, rising bonds will help offset the losses from equities and you just rebalance.

What can you do if Burry is right about the passive bubble? Invest in other, truly uncorrelated asset classes.

Chiefly I would suggest long volatility and gold. I haven't figured out how to optimally express long volatility without killing myself on the carry as a retail investor.

How are things at the $2 billion deli?

Hometown International, the mystifying New Jersey deli company that is valued at nearly $100 million on the stock market — despite running just a single deli — has ousted its CEO, according to a financial filing. 

Paul Morina, a local high school principal and renowned wrestling coach in the area, was removed after a vote by majority shareholders, according to the late Friday filing.

Morina owns about 1.5 million shares of the Paulsboro-based company, which are worth more than $18.5 million based on the company’s current stock price. 

Shareholders of the company also ousted the company’s only other executive, vice president and secretary Christine Lindenmuth, who works in her day job with Morina as an administrator at Paulsboro High School.

Here is the filing, from last Friday. It is not quite accurate to say — as the New York Post’s headline does — that shareholders fired Morina. It’s more that they demoted him. He lost a lot of titles:

On May 13, 2021, the Board removed Mr. Morina from all officer positions he held with the Company, including President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer of the Corporation, effective immediately as of such date. 

But he still runs the deli:

Mr. Morina and Ms. Lindenmuth remain principals of the Company’s operating subsidiary, Your Hometown Deli, LLC.

See, Your Hometown Deli is a deli in Paulsboro, New Jersey, that occasionally sells sandwiches, mainly to curious financial journalists. Hometown International Inc. is a U.S. public company, with a basic market capitalization of about $100 million and a fully diluted market cap of about $2 billion, that is some sort of mechanism for taking a foreign company public in U.S. markets and that also happens to own the deli. The $2 billion public company is now run by Peter Coker Jr., a Hong Kong-based financier who was already the chairman of the board and a major investor in Hometown International, and who “intends to devote his full time to seeking a business combination for the Company,” as the company said back in March. It makes sense that the mergers guy in Hong Kong would run the $2 billion company that’s in the business of merging with an Asian company, and the wrestling coach in New Jersey would run the local deli in New Jersey. Sensible division of labor! It was always weird to have the New Jersey wrestling guy in charge of the Asian merger company! Also it’s weird that they’re the same company.

The deli has had some other good filings recently. Yesterday it disclosed that its quarterly report will be late, “because the Registrant needs additional time to complete certain disclosures and analyses to be included in the Report.” The relevant quarter ended on March 31, before Hometown became famous, so the problem is not that they sold so many sandwiches to so many financial journalists that their accounting systems couldn’t keep up. I assume that, given their recent scrutiny, everything just needs to be lawyered a bit more carefully than it has been in the past.

Also here is an April 30 filing in which Hometown “disavows the price of its publicly quoted stock on the OTC Markets under the trading symbol ‘HWIN.’ Management is aware of no basis to support the Company’s stock price, based upon its revenue or assets.” I am not sure I have ever seen a company “disavow” its stock price before, but I suppose it makes sense. The filing accurately notes that “there has not been, nor is there, significant trading volume in the Company’s stock,” so it’s not like anyone is particularly getting ripped off by the deli’s weird stock price. It’s just a weird artifact. Still, probably best to disavow it.",nfgipo,Update on Your Hometown Deli in New Jersey

I sort of assumed that Hometown International Inc., the $100 million or maybe $2 billion deli, would remain a mystery forever, but Mark Vandevelde of the Financial Times seems to have found the person behind it and asked him what he’s up to, and he cheerfully explained it. His name is Manoj Jain and he’s the co-chief investment officer of Maso Capital Investments Ltd., a Hong Kong fund that is one of Hometown’s biggest shareholders. And the explanation is more or less what everyone thought it was: The deli is a shell company that will be used to take an Asian company public in the U.S., sort of like a special purpose acquisition company but sleepier.

For much of the past decade, Maso has busied itself finding ways to help cash-rich companies in Asia transition to nimbler balance sheets. Last year Maso even launched a Spac, with Coker Jr as a director.

“We’re not afraid to roll up our sleeves and be innovators,” Maso’s co-chief investment officer Manoj Jain said. “We’re viewed as proponents of good governance in the region.” ...

“The concept of shell companies has existed globally for many years,” he said. “These are broadly quasi-dormant public companies, that can be used to merge with private companies quickly and easily.”

According to Jain, repurposing an existing business for M&A is an efficient way to extend the Spac model to smaller deals. “The target companies we’re speaking to are in the $300m to $600m zip code in terms of valuation,” he said. “To get it to work from a public market perspective, the Spac needs to be $75m to $100m.”

Yet setting up a Spac can cost millions of dollars in administration fees alone, eating up a large portion of the value in such a small deal. “[Hometown] is a more flexible structure . . . with a longer time to find a target, and a better economic uplift,” Jain said.

“It works like a mini-Spac,” he added. “When you execute the merger, the name changes, the ticker changes, the board changes, the management changes, everything changes, as the merged entity enters the US capital markets.” … Jain believes that, with the right acquisition target, Hometown may be able to list on the Nasdaq exchange.

From the beginning of the deli saga, this explanation — that the deli was going to do a reverse merger to take an Asian company public and then jettison its deli business, change its name and be the public vehicle for that unrelated new business — seemed to be the most likely answer, and here you go. U.S. public-company status — even on the over-the-counter markets, without a stock exchange listing — is valuable, so it makes sense that some investors in Hong Kong might put $2.5 million into a barely operating deli to buy its public status, and then try to find a company that could make better use of that status.

This does not really explain why it’s a $100 million deli, but, surprisingly, it does help explain why it’s a $2 billion deli. The deli’s $100 million basic market capitalization comes from multiplying its 7.8 million shares outstanding by its last trading price ($13 per share as of yesterday’s close, for a market cap of $101.4 million). That is too high. A U.S. public company shell is valuable, but it’s not worth $100 million, so you would not expect an acquirer to pay $100 million for the deli just to get its securities registration. But the stock doesn’t trade much, and for some mysterious reason some people seem willing to pay $13 per share to buy small amounts of it. I can’t explain this, but I don’t worry too much about it: That $100 million valuation is not all that economically meaningful. It’s people buying a few hundred or thousand dollars’ worth of stock, not millions.

But I have insisted that the deli’s actual valuation is $2 billion, which is its fully diluted market capitalization. This weird number comes from the fact that the deli has weird warrants. In April 2020, Hometown got a $2.5 million investment from a handful of investors (including Maso), who bought stock at $1 per share (for a fairly reasonable post-money valuation of about $8 million 1 ). The next day, Hometown issued 20 warrants per share to each of its shareholders (including the brand-new ones, Maso et al.). Each warrant allows the holder to buy one more share for $1 each.

The result was that the deli was an $8 million shell company with a $2.5 million pot of cash (much of which it seems to be spending on consulting fees paid to those same shareholders), but with a $156 million pot of, as it were, contingent cash: The shareholders have made arrangements to put in up to another $156 million at some point in the future. 2  If the deli finds a good company to merge with and take public (or, rather, if Maso finds a good company for the deli to merge with), that company won’t pay to acquire the deli (and its public status). Instead, the deli will pay to acquire a stake in the company. It will be less like a typical reverse merger (a private company paying for an empty corporate shell) and more like a SPAC: The deli is a vehicle to both take a company public and raise money for it. The money will come not from the cash currently on the deli’s balance sheet (a modest $1.4 million as of the end of 2020), but rather from the $156 million that the deli’s existing investors have arranged to invest in the future. It’s like a SPAC, but instead of raising a pot of money and then hunting for a company to take public, it will hunt for the company to take public and then raise the money with warrants. 3  

I am not sure that this is a perfect plan from either a financial or a securities-law perspective, but it makes a sort of rough sense. For the first time, I feel like I understand the deli. Now let’s hope it does something else weird to keep us on our toes.

Also Vandevelde managed to get a cheesesteak at the deli. There’s a picture of it with the article. Planet Money’s Jacob Goldstein also went and got a turkey hoagie. It was apparently pretty good. If the shell-company reverse-merger-ing doesn’t work out, Hometown might have a lucrative future selling stunt sandwiches to financial journalists.",,

buy dividend stocks, and live off of that dividend / boost my retirement money. 

yes it gets taxed , but if you have solid companies, the underlying assets do not degrade. 

it is debateable if this is a good strategy to intitially grow your wealth (it certainly is not the most efficient and certainly does not offer the highest growth potential) but it works. 

I love dividends. I use them rightnow to boost my income already. 

and if you mix & match you can achieve stable dividend income at about 6-8% with a certain amount of diversification. 

if you really want to do this, do not go for the highest yield only. go for stability .

maybe take a look at   
REIT´s   
energy stocks

Let’s take something like the S&P 500. There are some insane valuations in there, similarly there are some companies that are fundamentally strong. Not all of them are going to collapse when the bubble does inevitably pop. 

The issue with an index is that capital is allocated based on an investment strategy that does not necessarily match the fundamentals. What Michael Burry et al. are correct about is that actively managed funds should be able to sort the wheat from the chaff, whereas an index will likely just buy all of them. 

So is there a problem? Possibly.

Don't buy stocks just because of a high yield, usually, there is a reason for why the yield is so high, usually because the business is challenged. What you should do is either buy great companies and hold them long term, or find distressed companies and stay for the turnaround, something like AT&T might be the latter, but it also might get crushed mismanagement and the weight of their debt. Maybe then you might avoid bag holding T for 9 years. 

Also, just another reason that dividend yields are mostly irrelevant, let's look at something like AAPL, which just announced a $90 billion dollar buyback. At the current 2.21T market cap, this represents about a 4.1% return to shareholders, excluding AAPL's dividend.

The domestic market has actually been a bit of an outlier in a few ways - some being survivorship biases tied to the post WWII environment, regulatory reform creating previously unanticipated premia, falling discount rates, and decoupling yields from real yields.

The concept everyone should understand here isn't historic return.  It's historic and anticipated risk premia.  Risk premiums effectively say ""an asset is priced for higher return because it has higher risk"".  When you own equities you are inherently taking the riskiest position in the capital structure, so equities carry the highest risk premium.

Historically that has been around 5%, but there's enough research out there on the subject to cast serious doubt that this relationship will continue.  For one it has not been the global experience that risk premia maintains 5% over time - even more curiously domestic equities are generally a safer stream of cashflows than many international ones, so the heightened risk premium is likely a result of historic accidental factors rather than some firm financial logic.  

Basically - equities will continue to be one of the best drivers of wealth over time, specifically because they place you as the owner of the stream of cashflows tied to the broad market.  That said anyone who anticipates 10% just because that's what it's done in the past is delusional, or simply doesn't understand what drives equity returns.  Anyone basing their personal financial planning off such a lofty return figure will be in for a fairly rude awakening, likely once it's too late to make major course adjustments. 


Like, on a personal level I think it's insanely reckless how people in subs like /r/financial independence push the idea that you can accumulate like 1.5MM and just live off it for the rest of your life.

371,,2021-05-18 18:25:32,t3_nfi5jg,,investing,"So, I've been doing a lot of research while i wait for my bank to connect to fidelity. Did my best to pick high performing ETFS. In my research, I come across a lot of recommendations for Vanguard this or that.  


So I decided to do a test on the portfoliovisulizer website. with the following, VTI, VXUS, and BIV (interm term bond)  


The results only showed results back to VXUS start date of Feb 2011. But when compared against the Vanguard 500 index investor,  using 3 portfolio allocations, of 40-30-30, 60-20-20 or 80-vti/ 20- vxus, The final balance underperforms the index by 3-10%   


So I get that perhaps the vanguard ETFs are great for people who dont want to do much work figuring out what to pick. (I just spent about 3 days comparing various ETFS), but they aren't the best options out there as the internet makes it seem, at least based on my limited knowledge and comparisons the last few days. Many other similar ETFs by other companies outperform vanguard if you just take some time to look.   


My strategy if you are interested:

I dont have a lot to invest personally, but my strategy is to seek funds with high dividends.  I think I'm going start off with $2000, maybe more. 

For the first 1000 I'm going do a somewhat simpler portfolio which is more or less an overall index. Not sure every security is represented, but the ETFS I have picked are mostly better than Vanguard options. 

The second, 1000, I'm going with funds based on sector strategy. (tech, health, energy, etc) plus a few others that I think will be growing as we bounce back from this pandemic. Again, tried to find high performance from past years, and high dividend funds.   
   
Only downside to this, is I will have 38 funds to manage.   
But 10 funds, have dividends over 3%,  another 8 between 2-3%  


I couldn't run all my picks on the portfolio analyzer site with a free account, so I split them pretty much with the two strategies above at 1000 each (carried a few over due to fund limit of 25)  


But I plan to contribute 100 monthly (50 toward each strategy in my simulations. Removed a few stocks that didn't have data for 10 years, but in the test my sector portfolio beat the benchmark by about $700. My other portfolio was below the bench a bit, but close.   


So, I'll keep rebalancing to see if i can get better numbers, or perhaps stick to what I have since the future is unknown.   
 But its been an interesting experience. who knows, maybe ill have something else completely different if I have to wait much longer for Fidelity to let me deposit.",nfi5jg,Vanguard ETF's dont appear to perform as well as the internet makes it seem

I'll say we're all mostly in agreement about the unlikelihood of meltdown because boomers retiring. However, I will say that MB isn't wrong in that the index funds have all the right features of a bubble or to form a bubble:

* General lack of understand of the underlying investment. And the investors actively being ignorant to it.

* The general push of funds into said investment.

* The general mentality of ""Just keep putting money in. It only goes up in the long run. And whatever dips will be gone in a few years. Even if you bought the top"" This probably the most important part. I remember this was literally the mentality of real estate investing prior to the 07 crash. 

MB (and trad economist) note that it's usually leverage and pumping that causes bubbles. Which I also believe could be true as well. People might be more willing to buy more and more into VOO than even the best stock because the diversification reduces risk. Someone who won't buy GOOG on margin might feel safe enough to do it for the SPY.

I think the big index funds are more likely to create larger swings than actually be the bubble themselves. They allow people to buy in easily, have stronger faith in the safer asset class and use leverage, and finally easily pull out when they think things are going down. Index funds will add upward push to the stocks and market when going up and will add additional downward pressure when markets go down much like leverage.",,

Your TLDR is accurate, though, since an ETF is playing catchup to rebalance changes that have occurred in the market over the last quarter (or whatever interval is used).

I think the bigger issue is somewhat touched on by you: ETFs can oversaturate investment in certain sectors of the market.

This is what diversification is all about. in this instance, you are including foreign stocks and bonds. Over he past 20 year a portfolio with international stocks and bonds will underperform us stocks. However historically International and US stocks each have periods of out performance. The bonds are there to intentionally sacrifice growth for less volatility in the portfolio.

>at least based on my limited knowledge and comparisons the last few days.

Have you ever considered that the people who make most of these recommendation have spent more time researching the history of assets allocation and portfolio management than you have? And have you considered that you might have been missing something when doing your own research?

> Not sure every security is represented, but the ETFS I have picked are mostly better than Vanguard options.


If this is true. you are not picking an overall index. by definition the overall index would be the same regardless of provider. It is likely you are picking a fund that is either more concentrated to a specific sector, factor or market cap.

More money entered the stock market last year and in the previous 10 years, or something like that, driven primarily because there wasn't anything else for us to do. People took what they would have spent, invested it in the market, got some great returns, but those same people are probably going to make up for a lot of spending on things they put off during this whole pandemic. Vacations, dining out, everything. When that happens, and the market is seeing net outflows every month, of course the indexes are going to go down. And of course, burry is going to say ""See? I told you so"". But in that case, while his answer was right ""the markets will go down"", the reason (in my view) will be completely wrong. 

If $400 billion gets withdrawn from the stock market, it's going to drive down prices, whether that money comes from broad index funds or if that money was invested in individual companies, I don't think it'll make a big difference.

Price discovery hasn't gone away. The pro shops and lots of us retailers use limit orders, that's the price discovery mechanism. Even if for every dollar of limit order there are two dollars of market orders flowing into index funds, it's not that the money went to index funds that will drive up up prices, its because there have been so many more buyers than sellers.

So, where to hide out?

I honestly don't think there are many good places to hide. Equities will get hurt everywhere from the S&P500 members to the ""tiny companies"" you'll find exposures to in much broader ETF's like VT and VTI. Yields are going back up after hitting record lows, so that doesn't bode well for fixed income investors. 

Despite my bearish outlook, I'm continuing to stay invested. I am carrying a bit more cash than usual on account of not wanting to hold bonds in this environment, but since I still have a couple decades left in my investing career, I would welcome lower prices and stay my course. I do separate exposures to various real assets, TIPS, and a small basket of companies which I think can navigate whatever the future throws at us, all in addition to index funds.

It's going to be a roller coaster, but even if Burry calls the correct end result, I'm not prepared to give him any credit. Yes, he called the mortgage crisis correctly, but I just think (to repeat) his assessment is wrong because it overlooks that all the money that came into the market would have still gotten invested whether it went into index funds, mutual funds, or individual stocks, and (again) it was that volume of buying that ran up the prices, not the vehicle it was invested in",,

>Not every business had the opportunity to transform/expand in the wake of Covid. Some businesses were well positioned to capitalize off of the pandemic and their stocks rallied as a result (DOCU, SPOT, ZM, etc...), however they are not all the best picks moving forward into 2021-2022. Still good picks long-term, but if we are comparing the possible return over the next 12-24 months, I believe they will be outperformed by the more cyclical stocks that will benefit off of the reopening. Disney was a weird one in that they were able to put their park operations on pause and focus on the expansion of their streaming services. They now sit at the helm of a huge content library in a world where streaming services are taking over the entertainment industry. Having this characteristic IN ADDITION to the incredible pricing power they have in their park and cruise-ships is largely what makes this stock/company so attractive to me right now.

&#x200B;

>**Some technical analysis I believe is relevant** \- Over the period starting 2010 and ending 2015, the stock rose roughly 3x to highs of about $120/share from the $40 range. This was after a long consolidation period lasting approximately 10 years where the stock was unable to leave that $40 level. Once the stock was able to break out of the range it was in however, it rose in a nice bullish trend above the weekly 50 day MA for nearly 5 years. I noticed that it has now been in a consolidation period for about 6 years after reaching the highs of $120 in 2015. The highs of $120 were temporarily broken in 2019 with their expansion efforts and made highs of $150. Then Covid hits and the stock crashes to lows of $81. After recapturing the weekly 200 MA and consolidating for awhile along that $120 price level the stock broke out and posted new all time highs of $203. We are now coming back down to test for support along what was once a level of resistance (realistically could go as low as $150 before reversing). This is a pattern that plays out time and time again and seems to be in line with the company's growth as well as the growth we can expect to see over the years to come. I expect the growth spurts are closer together for a number of justifiable reasons. We are likely entering into another period of growth as they continue to firm up their streaming services and open their parks back up.

Disney's stock has shown solid growth in terms of EPS over the past 10 years, showing a small retracement in 2019 due to their various acquisitions and investments into Disney+, the expansion and continued development of HULU and ESPN+, and the integration of 21st Century FOX.

&#x200B;

>I am certainly not an expert at valuing companies. I tend to spot trends and have a knack for thinking ""long-term"". I try to think about what might happen as things unfold. The overreaction the market saw in 2020 is being paid back now as the tech sector pulls back and attempts to find its footing. 2020 earnings were all over the place depending on what company we are talking about, but there were obviously some big winners. Most of the companies who saw huge earnings hikes will likely continue to grow at a reasonable rate in 2021 relative to the growth they saw every year prior to 2020 - still investors will sell stock after seeing earnings are down from 2020. How anyone could expect growth like that to be sustainable is beyond me. I figure it is just a bonus for these companies and they will be able to use the extra income to develop faster or combat inflation/economic troubles moving forward. It is not a gauge for future growth. 2020 was an anomaly...With this being said, Disney stock has been able to perform well over the past 12 months due to what I would call ""safe speculation"". Earnings were down big but the company is a behemoth - people know about Disney. Investors trust that the park will open back up and they will continue to do what they do. While a number of ""pandemic plays"" will be struggling to show revenue/growth anywhere near the levels of 2020, Disney earnings should be decent and should begin to level back off and stabilize. I believe a number of good companies will drop on good earnings this year until things level off.  
>  
>The company currently has a market cap of 308 billion. Keep in mind I said I am not expert at valuing companies. But with that being said, I do believe it is undervalued. Netflix alone is CURRENTLY valued at more than 215 billion with about 208 million paid subscribers. An article was released in Jan of 2020 stating that Barclays was valuing Disney+ at more than 100 billion alone. The service has added over 70 million paid subscribers since then, now totaling over 100 million paid Disney+ subscribers. The company anticipates around 230 to 260 million subscribers by 2024.  
>  
>Their direct-to-consumer segment includes HULU which has not been a huge profit generator, though I can personally attest to the fact that I would not even have Disney+ if it were not for HULU. Disney+/ESPN+ is not necessarily a package I would be interested in. The addition of HULU makes it worth it for me. I was already paying for HULU and figured it made sense to add the other 2 services for not much more $$$. Disney has agreed to take over the remainder of HULU from Comcast in 2024. I am interested to see what they do with it then. 

What is pricing power and why is it important ? Pricing power simply put is a companies ability to raise their prices over time for their services. Not only is Disney continuing to offer more and more value to their customers, but they also run a number of theme parks with attractions that are confined to Disney alone. A tourist could not simply choose to go elsewhere for their Disney amusement park needs. Disney is the only place you can see Disney. We all know the feeling of walking into an airport or an amusement park and thinking ""welp, today I am going to be overpaying for everything"" - but that's just how it is and we accept it. In an inflation economy, pricing power is absolutely key and this company has it! They are also continually reinvesting into their brand which has helped them maintain strong momentum over the years. 

This is a statement taken from a write-up by JPMorgan on pricing power -  **""Pricing power is one of the key attributes of a quality compounder. A key difference between a compounder and a cyclical company is that the compounder has the ability to sustain revenue even when demand in the economy contracts""**",nfipvu,Some thoughts on Disney - Why I am adding the stock to my long-term

>If Burry is right about the index fund bubble what's a good alternative?

If you truly believe that there will be a crash then the best option is to short the index funds. Sadly most people don't have the funds, knowledge, or sheer balls to short goliath. So in that case some high-yield inflation-adjusted government bonds from a country that is largely isolated from the epicenter of the potential crash?

China bonds paying around 3.6% yield now. Will likely go higher as economies heat up. Normally during economic crisis the USD gains strength against everything else as the default ""safe haven"" currency, but that might not be the case if it was a US crash of epic proportions. The 2nd factor why Chinese would be because it's the 2nd largest economy but has severe market restrictions and will actively pop forming bubbles because the CCP fears crashes which could lead to civil unrest. 3rd factor would be that most of these index funds are US based investing into what are mostly US companies.

You could get higher yields with Russia ~7% or Argentina ~50%, but those countries don't have the economy to power through a mega-recession (and thus collect taxes to pay the bonds), societal stability of an authoritarian dictatorship, or the economy of scale to rival the US. You could also try South Korea with a 2.2% rate, but that's miniscule, Korea's economy isn't as big or stable as China's. And the WON tends to fall relative to the USD when shit hits the fan. And of course you can always buy lower yield US bank notes.

Still this is largely hypothetical. I don't think there will be a big market correct for at least a few years. Usually market tanks come every 7-12 years rather than 1-2 years after. By that time, you never really know what will be the problem.",,

How much will increased debt impact forward earnings? 

Let's suppose the future EPS will be $1.50/share - does it really deserve a forward P/E of 20? Maybe the EPS gets up to $3 again - right now it's pretty cheap in that case.

""I think it can go higher"" isn't a great reason to be in an investment, by itself.

But because it's almost the entire market it might not be intrinsically problematic. Basically stocks are over-valued compared to other asset classes, but given the huge role public firms play in the world economy, that doesn't seem that problematic. 

2) If investors, however, have highly varying systemic doubts or are on average over-leveraging or buying ETFs beyond their investment holding window, the stock market boom over the past 15 years or so could lead to an ugly correction. Like any bubble. 

Basically people have massively over-bought into the passive investing ETF craze (which honestly does have a LOT going for it). A crash and resultant loss of paper wealth might have economic effects that might signal a longer-term recession. 

3) I'm somewhat doubtful of the etf bubble theory. The entire stock market seems the definition of too big to fail. It seems in any prolonged depression the Fed will step in to ensure cheap money. PERHAPS, and this is highly unlikely, if crypto does unseat the Fed as a monetary authority, we might see the real cost of speculation. But the dynamics of both retail investors and large funds leveraging off the expectation of rescue - moral hazard basically - might be another major source of systemic risk. 

If anyone has a chart of share of etfs and stock market as total investments over past decades, please share! 

4) To attempt to answer the question, there doesn't seem any way to avoid the stock market and earn the 6-8% it's associated with. Doing so will assume you'll be able to pick winners out of the entire ETF line-up. In any proper crash resulting from an ETF bubble burst, your narrow picks would fall anyway, and very possibly fall more than the market decrease. 

The partial answer then might be a truly long investment window (>20 years) to ride out any of the above fluctuations, asset diversification - including buying the house that you plan to live in and a neighborhood that you expect to appreciate, and focusing on increasing your earning power in your career.",,

for one, if one could get a safe 3% return then they would have zero inflation protection.  At an income as low as 45k even normal inflation will have you living off pennies within a few years.  To put this in context 45k has the same purchasing power that 30k had 20 years ago, this is with a historically low period of inflation - could you imagine trying to live on 30k in retirement?  Then 20k in another decade?  So that's one issue. 

The second is that the entire ""safe withdrawal rate"" framework is based on US market returns.  So from a conceptual standpoint it's rather silly - they've basically said ""well, if we have another century where we're the best performing market in the world by a significant margin you're fine"".

Also, let's say you assume some risk in the portfolio, which is prudent - and there's a crash.  Your 1.5MM might be worth 1MM, well then your 45k is a 4.5% withdrawal rather than 3%.  This condition may persist moving forward, it only takes a few years of down markets to wreck someone's financial picture when they're cutting it that close - especially when they're trying to retire early.

672,,2021-05-18 20:25:44,t3_nfl8th,,investing,"Notes from Toyota Motors (TM) 2020 full year Earnings Call (13 May 2021)

Why do you care? Good question, automobile manufactures have gotten higher multiples (at least for a short time) based on producing, or moving closer to producing Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), and sometimes just by pretending they will change their name to emphasize Electrical terminology, and of course having a company named after the people who discovered how to make electricity work gets really high multiples (doesn’t work for utilities named after Edison though). Toyota has been reluctant to move into the BEV space, did this change? Will they rename themselves after Alessandro Volta? Let’s find out.

First, I really want to thank the modern world that can take spoken Japanese from multiple speakers and convert that into written English so cheaply that I can read it on the internet without a paid subscription to anything! It’s a wonderful time to be alive!

Oh, I guess it's fashionable to add a disclaimer so the black helicopters don’t come and lock me in a bank vault without my reading glasses or something right? Fine, I make my living breaking big atoms into little atoms so nothing I say or type should ever be considered medical, financial, legal, or romantic advice. Good enough? Let’s go.

I can’t find an old blog post I read in the 2009–2011-time frame to give credit, but it was pretty insightful, the blog author did a word search for “customer” in both the Amazon and IBM earnings call, and showed how Amazon (huge number of times saying “*customer*”) would be a better investment because that’s where their focus was compared to IBM which had very few hits for “customer”.  I haven’t checked, but I think Amazon has had slightly better returns than IBM from 2009-present.

CTRL-F for “*customer*” returns **53 hits** for TM, things like:

>“And Toyota is always listening to customers, always trying to develop products that are suitable for every part of the world. And we have to remember that the goal is not electric vehicles. The goal is carbon neutrality. And even if we have the best technology, if it's not chosen by customers, it will not have the impact of reducing emissions and that's the reason why we've chosen to have a full lineup, and we've invested in all of these technologies.”

Compare that to **their competitor**, the largest automobile manufacturer (**by market cap**) most recent earnings call shows just **10 hits** for “*customer*” with things like:

>“we had not yet begun customer deliveries”  
>  
>“what we obviously opt to do is to refund customers their deposit”  
>  
>“continue to accumulate bitcoin from transactions from our customers as they purchase vehicles”

Quite a difference in company philosophy!

Starting off with the prepared statement, this company is a beast! Their fiscal year begins and ends in March so this is for the entire Covid year without the benefit of the Jan-March 2020 pre-Covid or the reopening time after vaccinations ramped up, this is the worst possible time period and the sold 9.087 Million vehicles (96% of 2019 numbers) under the Toyota/Lexus name and an additional 7.646 Million consolidated vehicles (85.4% of 2019 numbers).

Quick note, they use the term “electrified vehicles” to include Hybrid (HEV), Plug in hybrid (PHEV) and battery electric (BEV) and Hydrogen Fuel Cell electric (FCEV). The sales of electrified vehicles were 112.3% of 2019, which I think were mostly HEVs.

They went through all the various gains and losses to operating income (currency exchange rates, marketing, cost reductions) and overall operating income went UP by 10 Billion (JPY not USD). Then announced the dividend at a payout ratio of 29.8%. Announced a resumption of share buybacks (had been suspended during the pandemic) of up to 250 BILLION (JPY). Also, a five for one stock split will happen on September 30 2021.

Next the future projections, consolidated 113% of 2020, Toyota/Lexus 105.6% of 2020, and expected 2.8 Million electrified cars 129% of 2020 (29.2% of vehicles sold will be electrified). Again, a breakdown of predicted expenses with an overall prediction an operating income increase 365 Billion (with a B, in JPY)!!

Next, they took questions. First question wanted more detail on predicted finances which they answered, then a very detailed discussion of the plan:

>“By 2050, we are to realize carbon-neutral. That is our target. The new vehicle CO2 is not the point. Transport use -- this overall cycle of CO2 use will have to be made neutral. That will be the point. So at this point, rather than restricting or limiting the types of technologies to be used, in order to realize carbon neutrality, various options or various technologies will have to be addressed. We think that will be the most important point and that is where Toyota is putting its entire efforts in. More specifically, we at Toyota has HEV, PHEV, battery EVs or BEVs or FCEVs”

From later in the call, but I wanted to move it here since it explains how they define the term:

>“What does carbon neutrality actually mean for the automotive industry? Carbon neutrality for the automotive industry means achieving zero CO2 emissions in all processes throughout the lifecycle of manufacturing, transporting, operating, fueling and/or charging, and recycling and disposing of vehicles.”

Then they discuss very specific breakdown of anticipated sales of electrified vehicles by region by 2030 and:

>“And globally, this will add up to 8 million electrified vehicles, including hybrids, out of which battery EVs and FCEVs in total would account for about 2 million units. That is our plan. Of course, ultimately, the choice is up to the customer. But at this moment, this is what we are forecasting.”

Followed by a detailed discussion about the scope of the challenge for future battery production and:

>“at the moment, Toyota's supplied power is 6 gigawatts hours. And in order to realize these numbers, 180 gigawatt hours is necessary; in other words, 30 times the current number. So if you translate that into EV production lines, currently, we have two lines, but that will have to be more than 60 lines, that is more than 30 times. So we will make aggressive investments so that we can realize that. And in addition to that, for battery development or basic units will be reduced, and we will work with alliance partners for procurement so that we can procure the necessary goods. And in addition to that, for battery EV development, compared to the current situation, 15% to 30% reduction in development lead time is to be aimed at. “

And

>“So for the investments, electrification case, digitalization, roughly speaking, on an annual basis, we are currently making an investment of JPY 1 trillion. This year, compared to the past levels, we intend to increase investment by 20%”

Did you notice that number, Trillion! I ran out of fingers and toes to count how many zeros that was.

Next the BIG question: “**how do you see the supply demand forecast for semiconductors**?”

Well:

>“The supply demand situation still can fluctuate and we cannot sit back and relax yet, but we are not forecasting a major impact by semiconductors”

Compare that to **their competitor**, the largest automobile manufacturer (**by market cap**) most recent earnings call:

>“yes. This quarter, and I think we'll continue to see that a little bit in Q2 and Q3. So Q1 was -- had some of the most difficult supply chain challenges that we've ever experienced in the life of Tesla and same difficulties with supply chain, with parts -- over the whole range of parts. Obviously, people have heard about the chip shortage.  
>  
>This is a huge problem.”

Am I just cherry picking, trying to sensationalize something for clicks? Well, here is **what Ford had to say** in their earnings call:

>“The semiconductor shortage and the impact to production will get worse before it gets better. In fact, we believe our second quarter will be the trough for this year. We have worked to do to get our industry footprint back to firing on all cylinders or maybe should I say fully charged. Overall, though, I'm proud of the progress we made as a team, as our underlying strength at Ford improves”

Then another important question “you also showed the outlook for carbon neutral for 2030, and you talked about 6 million, and your plan was to increase carbon-neutral vehicles and PHEV. And could you share with us the reason why you believe customers will be choosing those vehicles?”

Remember the customer! Here’s part of their answer:

>“And for 2030, for one thing, as Mr. Kamisawa mentioned in his own question, the battery EV, its prices and availability of infrastructure on the global situation is not likely to progress significantly. That's one assessment. And with respect to hybrid EV and plug-in hybrid EV, those are easier for customers to choose and use.  
>  
>But I would like to add further to that question about the Japanese data. We are focused on connectivity or connected. And through connected network, we obtain information and data on vehicles. And even in the case of hybrid EVs or plug-in hybrid EVs, especially in urban areas, the distance traveled by electric mode is quite long. And probably, we can share with you later on, but in the urban areas, generally speaking, there is some difference between urban area and suburban areas, but in urban areas, even in the case of hybrid electric vehicles, about 50% of the times, it is running on the electric mode.  
>  
>And in the case of PHEV, of course, there are differences in conditions, but 70% or 80% of the times, it is driven on pure electric mode. So hybrid EVs or plug in hybrid EVs, not just their performance and also the data that we can obtain through connectivity, and also, we use information we obtain from navigations. And using that, depending upon where the vehicle is located, the EV mode ratio can be increased or decreased, so adjusted. And those can be doable in the future through hybrid vehicles as well as plug-in EVs. So we would like to make contribution to the environment in a sustainable manner as well as practical manner.”

So the first hour of the two hour call was intended to be focused on the financials and the second half on the future (more long term plans) for electrification, batteries, data and Woven City. The questioners wanted to focus on all that stuff right away, so they answered the questions.",nfl8th,Notes from Toyota Motors (TM) 2020 full year Earnings Call (13 May 2021)

That line is required on almost every piece of marketing materials from any broker or investment advisor. And it so far has rung true in a remarkably consistent way. Long term outperformers are few and far between.

I don't buy into a 10% expected return, I think 7% to 8% is much more realistic, and in this case being realistic means investing more to reach ones goal than you would have to if you were hoping for a 10% annualized return. Long term, each years annual return has been pretty random, just as they are each day. I think 54% of days from the beginning of time have been positive, but when you stack them all together, it shows that the average return you can expect from the market is 7-8% (or 10%).

What's the alternative? Sit in cash? Pay fund managers money to underperform (which, on the whole, they do after fees and taxes)? Try to do your own research and best the people who do this full-time? That's the problem with criticizing indexing out of hand - you have to suggest what would work better for people.

So first, I would never recommend investing only in the 500 index of US stocks - might as well go global. Second, I would also recommend adding bonds. But the main thing (again) is that no one is saying 'indexing will give you %XX returns' - you'll get the market returns with less fees.

The more time you take to DCA, the more cash drag affects your returns. If you invest all of your money at once, you are 100% exposed and your performance will mirror the stock market.

The average direction of the returns of the stock market is positive, which means you miss out on gains on average.

DCA of 1 year adds an annual underperformance of 0.38%. Basically an MER of 0.38% for an ""active"" strategy.

Ben Felix released a paper if you want to see more.

https://www.pwlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Dollar-Cost-Averaging-vs-Lump-Sum-Investing.pdf

He also explained it in one of his podcasts. Timestamp at 31:49. The 0.38% number is at timestamp 38:32.

By not having all of your money tied to the stock market at T+0, you aren't efficiently capturing the rise of the market as a whole. This results in underperformance of your portfolio compared to the market.

He looked at 10-year rolling periods (Jan 1970 - Jan 1980, Feb 1970 - Feb 1980, etc), individually in Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, UK, and the US, of 100% equity portfolios. DCA was done with $1 million over 12 months.

On average, the annual growth of the DCA portfolio trailed the lump sum portfolio by 0.38%.

One bullish option strategy is to buy put options and write a put option with a slightly different strike price to gain a premium on the options sold while hedging their position with the slightly cheaper put options. [Explanation here](https://youtu.be/sZrMhrmhDCQ). The goal is for the options to expire worthless.

Are fund managers able to write options without reporting them on the 13F and is it possible Scion is doing a credit spread? This might be apparent if the options transactions were located and there was accompanying writing of options at the existing strike price with the same expiration date.

Wondering if this is possible  - though it makes sense that the put position is bearish given TSLA's current overvaluation.",nfm85a,Is it Possible that Michael Burry (Scion Asset Management) Purchased Tesla Puts as Part of a Credit Spread?

I have a question regarding ethics. My mom gave me an initial investment of $235,000 USD. She knew I knew what I was doing because I grew my account from $15,000 to $100,000 in a few years. She gave me this money expecting an ROI of 10-20% within a year, but I was able to grow her initial investment to just under $1.2 million in 7 months. After realizing this profit I offered her $750,000 USD while I keep the remaining profit to buy a rental property and continue other investments. She argued how that is her money and she will give me $50,000 USD. I don’t think that is morally right as if I hadn’t invested she would still only have the initial investment.

However in last years, players field got suddenly so competitive. Every million hand I made less money. My profitability went down. Top earners start to earn less. My game has not change, but everyone got so solid. Reality has change. 

USA will not have same macro - financial reality as last 100 years. Think of 1918 how much of potencial USA had. Or in 1945. So much technological edge, Britain being bankrupt, Germans down, half of world with Russians in communism. USA had half of world gdp. 

You think USA has same potencial growth in 2021 as in 1918 or in 1945. You think Chinese are not competitors? 

Japan is great technological coutry, but never fully recovered from 1990 bubble . Their PE ratio was 90 for god sake. Like Michael Burry says big bubble = long recovery 

Great Britain, once a mighty empire has low stock returns in last 30 years. In 19 century they had such a bubble they banned trading for 40 years or what.

Imagine hyper inflation and S & P 500 losing 80 %. No one in our generation would buy stocks again. Our kids maybe...",,

But chances are most of you will be. You can do a pretty good job of estimating whether you will be alive in 5, 10, or even 50 years. But some of us will die much earlier, others will live longer.

In terms of investing, you will be better off in most of the likely worlds if you invest. In some possibilities, your investments won't matter to your quality of life for all sorts of personal, economic, or geopolitical reasons. I happen to think it is likely that I will live at least 20 if not 35 years. Investing now increases the likelihood that my life will be better in the future.  It is a risk because I could spend now and get an immediate benefit, but it is a calculated risk based on my estimate of the likely outcomes.

It is my estimate that I have a higher likelihood of improving my circumstances by investing in index funds rather than stock picking, directed mutual funds, or using an advisor. Some people may have the skills to pick stocks, mutual funds, or advisors. But I don't.  So by choosing one of these options over index funds, I don't think I would have any better than a random chance of outperforming the market. I would also increase the risk that I would greatly underperform the market.

I am not counting on a certain rate of return. But it is useful to make estimates to see the impact of choosing to invest. I do that with the confidence that real results will vary.",,

The analysis was there, but I can spell out for you: growth in the indexes has relied on a particular economic and political reality, but that's not always necessarily going to continue. A big political shift could be bearish. And if indexers are banking on historical returns being representative of future returns, they need to pray that capitalism continues in a low-reg way.

So you have 10% annual return in the past 95 years. That’s a long period of time. You can make a prediction, or guess, that future returns would be around that percentage. However, one guarantee this guess will be correct. Only time will tell. There can be another apocalypse in 5 years, or bubble burst in 10 years, depression in 25 years, or WW3 in 20 years, no one knows. All of which can crash the entire stock market in a matter of days.

The problem here isn't forecasting, it's people intentionally trying to mis-represent what return forecasting is in order to create some stupid dismissive narrative.  

Here's a paper by the former head of asset pricing for NBER, it was their presidential address to the American Finance Association - so basically this is about as mainstream and accepted as things get: https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w16972/w16972.pdf

Here's a relevant excerpt: 

>Thus the estimates say that all price-dividend ratio volatility corresponds to variation in
expected returns. None corresponds to variation in expected dividend growth, and none to
“rational bubbles.”
In the 1970s, we would have guessed exactly the opposite pattern. On the idea that
returns are not predictable, we would have supposed that high prices relative to current
dividends reflect expectations that dividends will rise in the future, and so forecast higher
dividend growth. That pattern is completely absent. Instead, high prices relative to current
dividends entirely forecast low returns.
This is the true meaning of return forecastability.4 This is the real measure of “how
big” the point estimates are — return forecastability is “just enough” to account for price
volatility. This is the natural set of units with which to evaluate return forecastability.
What we expected to be 0 is 1; what we expected to be 1 is 0.",,

CPI looks at all consumer goods and services to get a better handle on the monetary situation of the entire country. Picking and choosing which goods and services to include in the CPI will lead to an incomplete view of inflation and the economy as a whole. 

If you’d like, you can construct your own necessity price index using the component price indices at FRED, the federal reserve’s economic data portal. When I tried my hand at it, I used shelter, food at home, medical care services, transportation, and fuels+ utilities. I used the same component weights as the CPI does, since they’re based on how much consumers spend on each respective item. I actually found that median personal income, even adjusted for this new price index, has increased over time. 1989 and 2007 took nearly a decade to recover, but 2019 had an all time high necessity-inflation-adjusted median personal income.

But you can also say that on the last 5 years it has got an average yield of x%. To compute this average yield use the CAGR formula (see Wikipedia CAGR).

Now you are not guaranteed to get that yield next year, you might get more, you light get less, the past yearly yields are a good exemple of that.

However you can still use it to decide in which fund or ETF to invest. If you have to pick between 10, you will not pick the one that has had negative result over the last years as it could be evidence of poor management decisions for an actively managed fund, or that the sector or thematic an ETF focus is in decline. But you might not want to pick the best performing one either because he might not be reproductible year over year, it could do 32% one year and  -4% the second year, its less predictible. Or maybe that market sector is already too high and might not perform as well over the next decade.

Usually you should aime for fund with CAGR between 4-10% mixing it up somewhat. Get some that are very predictible (ie almost the same performance every year) even if it is only 4-5% to build a stable basis in your portfolio. Complement this with a few that provide better results even if they don't get those huge result every year.",,

I'm not sure if this is agains the rules but it really is a fantastic watch

This was an AMA done with Wes Christian, a lawyer who has been an advocate for financial reform for many years. I don't want anyone to dismiss this due to the fact that the whole Gamestop situation started it. 90% of the AMA was about some of the illegal things that are being done behind the scenes in our markets namely naked short selling, ""kicking the can down the road"" on fail to delivers, and some of the legal actions that be undertaken. These types of situations not only affect stock price but theoretically affect the actual governance of companies via the proxy votes (I was surprised to hear that 100%+ voter turn out was seen by Wes many times, and he even mentioned 200%+ on occasion not including all the people and institutions that don't bother to vote.) There are rampant issues in our markets that may not seem to affect the average investor like myself, but pose risks that I think everyone should at least be aware of. The only purpose of this post (and I'm sure there will be others) is to spread this information to as many people as possible because that's the only way to speed up actual reform that will benefit us all in the long term",nfo809,A very insightful AMA with a lawyer that IMO is a must watch for anyone wanting to gain insight on some of the shady inner workings of the market
