I have had sweet, *unrealized* gains with those tickers plenty of times. But every single time, even if I didn't screw up and panic sell on a dip, I still let loads of unrealized gains slip through my fingers. There's reason why not everyone gets rich left and right even when so many stocks rocket all the time. Everyone holding gets to experience the juicy unrealized gains, but only a fraction of folks actually realize notable gains. The peak never lasts and it often doesn't take long to go from being rich to bleeding cash. I like the digital cash because while it's a lot more volatile, I have faith in it rising overall in the future so it's fine for me to not constantly watch it. With these stocks, anything can happen and their price isn't being driven by long term fundamentals (for the most part) but pressure against shorting. It's not something I personally can feel comfortable just casually checking now and then.",,

McKinsey & Co. has done a thorough research on Blackberry's security software development plans that are aimed at the rapidly growing EV market. Their research conclusion expected Blackberry to grow significantly in the coming years due to the uprising of the EV market. They obviously can't predict the future, but the fact that a well-informed consultancy company like McKinsey made this prediction persuaded me to invest in it as well. 

It is hard to tell if it is gonna give you any profits on the short term but if you can afford to keep the investment for the long term it would probably be a very smart investment. Send me a PM if you need any more information about the research itself or anything else!",,

The best way to look at investment is that your money at any given time could be doing one of a million things, and you are choosing which is the best possible thing it could be doing right now.

So it's more like this:

Bought ABC at $10 a while back, can sell for $30 now. Why are you selling -> seems it's going to go down from now so sell high.

Fine then, sell. Now it's cash. Is it cash for long? Are you going to wait for it to get to $20? No. It's getting invested into YYY that is currently at $10 and you think it will become $30.

Fast forward, now ABC is $20 again, and YYY is $30. Do you sell YYY to buy ABC? No, because ABC will only get to $30, but YYY is slated to get to $50 in the same time frame.

This is the same logic by which it makes sense to take a loss and sell at a bad stock time, if there's a better opportunity elsewhere.

Say you are all in YYY and it tanks overnight. You bought at $10 but it fell to $8. But ABC fell to $5 and you feel certain that ABC will climb back to $30 faster than YYY. Then sell YYY, take the loss, and get into ABC asap. Because of the million things your money could be doing right now, getting into ABC is the best thing you can see in this very moment, including taking the loss at YYY.",,

I'm new on the stockmarket, I'm a novice and not a professional investor, nor do I work in the field.  
I decided to try my hand at trading partly for fun and ofcourse to make a bit extra if I can.

The thing I'm struggling with the most is how to determine what stocks to buy.  
You often see stocks suddenly soar (like AMC atm), or suddenly plummet, but how do you ""predict"" this? I've messed around in some smaller stocks a bit, starting with 100 usd just to try, and on all the trades I made ( I tried 4 over 4 days) I lost money.

Is it just an experience thing? Should I keep trying until I recognize patterns? Are there websites/magazines/whatever I should keep an eye on? Should I religously be checking this reddit?

My profit on DDD is right now 74% and I am not gonna sell because the portfolio is a longterm run, but I am almost certain it will crash down very soon again. There was no real reason for the surge, in fact the opposite was the case.

But when you have the balls to sell, then be happy with the money you just made. You made it because of your decision and no one can take it. THE WORST THING you can do is sell and get back in after it keeps rising or starts falling. Both are amazing death traps to neutralize your previous profits.

Learned that lesson when I started, roughly 5 or 6 years ago. Back then I had 2k and made an amazing high risk trade that returned a profit of 12k after a single day, so I had 14k. Those were options on oil with a price of 0.02 (the lowest it can go) and I put in all of my money. A tweet from the previous president made that happen - but that contract didn't stop at 0.12 where I sold, it surged up to beyond 1.50. Just to realize how much I missed out, I could have made 75 times of what I put in, or 2000x75=150000€ just after starting with 2k. So what happened afterwards?

I’d say, decide your investing timeline: long term, you should find companies that have been performing well in the long run (good profit margins, good management & good shareholder value) & hold to reap the longer term success

If you want a shorter time frame, look for technical analysis indicators that can predict, to a certain degree, of how the price could perform on an intraday/daily timeframe as traditional business metrics and valuations aren’t very important at all within a 4 day time period (unless there’s an earnings report or external information, but on a general basis they’re not important)

For technical analysis I use tradingview but YouTube videos should give you the basics

For long term information I mainly use company websites & yahoo finance

For example for some random stock with 10 million total shares the data i would like to know is below.

I would like to see how many stocks are purchased and are held at various price points, so i can see the distribution.

|Random Stock: ABCDEF - Current Price $65||
|:-|:-|
|Shares|Cost|
|1million|$10|
|4million|$20|
|4million|$30|
|1million|$60|

Why? I think analyzing the distribution and the change in distribution can provide some interesting investing information.

&#x200B;

For example.  Another imaginary stock and different distribution

&#x200B;

|Random Stock: ABCDEF2 - Current Price $65||
|:-|:-|
|Shares|Cost|
|0.5million|$5|
|0.5million|$10|
|3million|$50|
|6million|$60|

&#x200B;

The data between first one and second one paints a different picture.

It could be a way to identify pump and dumps, solid growth stocks, hot new stocks, and everything else.

I would like to figure out what i can figure out.  I just need the data.

So...... is this data available?  I am making sense? Is this being done already by hedge funds?

I am noticing some strange $KHC option flow lately, largely what appears to be bearish. Flow seems to indicate large amounts of selling calls for July 16th, 2021 and Jan 21 2022 with strike prices ranging from 30-37.5 and 20-30, respectively. 

At the same time, there are buys (of calls)  for same time frames for the same expiry's above with strike prices ranging from 35-37.5 and 14-24, respectively.

Can anyone explain to me the likely strategy of this order flow? It seems bearish, based on volume and premiums paid out for the selling of calls, versus the buying of calls. I am unsure if I am missing something?

393,gzp47f6,2021-05-27 23:33:05,t1_gzp47f6,t1_gzolr33,stocks,"NSA? Doubtful. Though its possible to make some hard to decrypt stuff with a QC I seriously doubt they are reliable or powerful enough right now for any actual productive use and as said before, you can easily make a non QC algo that is just as powerful. At best, they are probably just creating algorithms that might work once there is a reliable QC with enough qbits that it wont be trivial.

The cancer thing is nonsense. Makes absolutely no sense to use a QC in that manner. The problem with cancer is we have no way to actually get the data needed to work on a custom cure nor a way to create a custom DNA-targetting compound to specifically target only the cancer cells. This is not a number crunching problem. We literally dont have the tools for it yet. We need a way to more quickly map DNA (we just recently have been able to do that and its still expensive) and we still need a way to scan surface structures for active sites that might come into contact with the targeting compound. 

AFAIK, we have no accurate surface scanning tech yet nor am I certain that its even possible from a practical perspective. Rather what we are trying to do is map genes to what they create and extrapolate the cell structures from that. This is probably the right way to do it but we are no where near that goal. Not even close. I mean... we just now started producing highly accurate and relatively fast DNA sequencers in the last 5 years. See Pacfic Biosciences. Im not sure how far we are on gene mapping yet and thats just step 2. There are like 3 more steps after that, each more complex than the last. So in other words, we dont need the QC for this yet. We will eventually, but probably not yet.",,

The rest is spent on running the business and paying developers to create more content — but that payout amount is completely under their control, same as any other platform that pays creators. There’s no reason to assume that payouts won’t be adjusted, it can and does change, see YouTube.

Assuming no revenue growth is pure conjecture when they have yet to show signs of flatlining. I do agree that the growth rate is not sustainable in the long term, which is why expansion is their priority.

There’s no reason a YouTube-of-games can’t be successful and long lived. I’m not sure why bringing up single games as relevant examples, when they’re not not competing with in-house game developers.

646,,2021-05-28 01:16:52,t3_nmmgod,,stocks,"Closing on a home in June. Need to sell some stocks and trying to decide which ones.

We have Google and Amazon from 2013 which have been our biggest returns but I think we should hold considering those are two of the biggest companies right now.

We also have some stock we bought in February in anticipation of travel opening back up - United Airlines, Carnival, and Disney. 

UA and Carnival have had positive returns. Surprisingly (to me) Disney has not. 

We play the long game with these and originally planned on holding on to Disney for awhile and I am stubborn enough to not want to sell at a loss.

My wife also has some stocks in US real estate. We were originally going to hold on to this bc of the market (it's given us positive gains) but then thought about it and think it might've peaked.

We also have US emerging markets and European emerging markets. Neither of which I know much about...my wife invested in those but they have also had a positive gain.

We have had other losses too...those were long term stocks we decided to sell bc there wasn't any net return.

Any advice on which ones to sell? I am thinking Disney, as hard as it is to sell after less than six months, and US real estate.

TLDR: need some advice on what to sell to help with a home purchase. Leaning towards Disney and US real estate. Help! Don't want sellers remorse...",nmmgod,Advice - what to sell to help with home down payment?

However,

JOAN is looking exceedingly undervalued at the moment, and could definitely be one to look in to. This is one that I found in a thread on here a week or two ago, and I ended up opening a small position (50 shares). I like the risk/reward because it is more about JOAN coming up to a reasonable valuation instead of somehow drastically increasing business. 

They also just announced that they will be paying a dividend of .10 per share (.40 per year) starting June IIRC. This places the yield at around 2.7% which all in all is not bad. The fact that they have decided to start paying out a dividend is a good sign to me because it tells me that they are expecting cash flow to increase.


A few others to look at: ABR, CRSR, BFI, UTZ, NEGG (Market cap on NEGG hasn't updated on many services yet, it's actually around 4.5 to 5bln, not 70mln).

NEGG likely won't 10x as it is just too niche of a website at this point, but the potential for a decent multiple is still there.

NASDAQ: RAVE:  
  
\- Franchises two pizza brands with 160+ stores across the US and 30+ in international locations  
  
\- Full franchise business model to save on costs  
  
\- Brand new management with a track record of bringing franchises back from the dead  
  
\- Posted strong profits and cash flows in 2020 despite COVID - profits up more than 6x yoy by the end of 2020 with net cash balance sheet of $4+ million  
  
The company has been served a delisting notice by NASDAQ multiple times yet it comes back every time so I have a good feeling on this one. It's pretty cheap right now trading around $1 ish but with the upcoming economic reopening, I'm hopeful they will break $2 at the minimum. Restaurants are bound to have more business this summer with the vaccine rollout, stimulus checks, economic reopening and what not, which means more earnings and cash for RAVE on top of what they already have despite a dreadful year for small businesses.

I bought AMC at 10 some 2 weeks ago, and now it seems the price is getting skyrocketed (now at 26) by pretty much the same type of operation than for GameStop, which I understand is ''Meme stock''.

I'm seeing this as very good, of course, but I feel like this whole GameStop situation was a one-time thing, so who knows. With that, what should I wait and look for? Is it possible to see those stocks skyrock? Is the general consensus is that it's going to fail?

735,gzpjztd,2021-05-28 01:50:38,t1_gzpjztd,t1_gzp51ic,stocks,"Basically, the actual price of the share means absolutely nothing. It could be 5 cents or $500. The $500 share could be cheap and the 5 cents one could be expensive. 

Ways that you can decide whether a stock is overpriced are: P/E ratio- this is one of the main stats that people look at; a lot of people consider around 20 as the sort of fair value point so above 20 could be considered on the high side. 
Also look at their market cap and the amount of free money the company is generating (called free cash flow). If the company's market cap (which is the amount of shares multiplied by the share price) is $20 billion then you would expect/hope that the company would actually generate that much cash over the next few years to warrant that valuation. 

CloudFlare has a market cap of $25 billion but they have negative cash flows currently. So it's safe so say that it's highly speculative. You wouldn't be able to value the company in a traditional way like this because they aren't generating free cash and they aren't making a profit. So you would have to instead do a lot of research into the company and decide how much you think they will grow and what their earnings may be 10 years from now.

The market is not like a piggy bank; money doesn't go into or out of it. When somebody buys a stock, they are buying it from somebody else.  For every buyer, there is a seller on the other side of the trade. So if I buy a share of stock for $100 dollars, somebody else just sold a share of the same stock for $100. The money doesn't end up in the market; it ends up in somebody else's account. You can talk about the total amount of money transacted in the market, though that could be just a matter of shares being traded back and forth with no price movement. You could also talk about the total amount of capital that companies raise by issuing shares of their stock and selling them, which is what the top-level comment of this thread is getting at, but that is not affected by transactions on the secondary market that don't involve the company itself. However, it doesn't really have any meaning to talk about money being put into the market, because the stock market fundamentally isn't something that stores money.

988,,2021-05-28 03:50:28,t3_nmp2qy,,stocks,"I put money into my roth IRA this year but it looks like I will be over the income limit. 

My understanding is that I owe 6% on principle but even if I fix the issue before the end of the tax year, I will still get hit with the 10% early withdrawal fee.

Is there a way to withdraw the money from the IRA before the end of the year and not get hit with the 6% or 10% fee?

I believe the money was contributed to the roth IRA in March 2021 and I purchased $6000 of VTI which was blended with my previous IRA contribution. Which means the contribution has appreciated so I don't even know how much to withdraw, especially since I have dividends reinvesting. 

Any insight?",nmp2qy,Made a mistake with my Roth IRA. Please help
